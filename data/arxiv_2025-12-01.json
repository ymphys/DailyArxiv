    "title": "Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI",
    "abstract": "We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \\kappa/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\\kappa \\ \\simeq \\ \\varepsilon \\ \\simeq \\ 1/3$ and $H_\\star/H_0 \\ \\simeq \\ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.",

Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure.

    "abstract": "Prompt cusps (PCs) form from the direct collapse of overdensities in the early Universe, reside at the center of every dark matter halo, and have density profiles steeper than $r^{-1}$ NFW cusps. Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context.",

    "abstract": "The core mass function (CMF) of prestellar cores is essential for understanding the initial conditions of star and cluster formation. However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 \\mu m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new suite of 1,024 cosmological and hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos, run with Cold Dark Matter, as part of the DREAMS Project. Each simulation in the suite has a unique set of initial conditions and combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. The suite is designed to quantify theoretical uncertainties from halo-to-halo variance, as well as stellar and black hole feedback. We develop a novel weighting scheme that prioritizes regions of the input parameter space, yielding galaxies consistent with the observed present-day stellar mass--halo mass relation. The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus~(GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties. Our results highlight the necessity for large statistical samples to disentangle the stochastic nature of galaxy formation and robustly model the Milky Way's unique history.",

    "title": "Episodic Star Formation -- I. Overview and Scatter of the Star-Forming Main Sequence",
    "abstract": "Episodic star formation cycles in both high- and low-redshift galaxies have gained more and more evidence. This paper aims to understand the detailed physical processes behind such behaviors and investigate how such an episodic star-forming scenario can explain the scatter in star-formation rate (SFR) of star-forming main-sequence galaxies. This is achieved through tracing back in time the history of z=0 star-forming central galaxies in the TNG100 simulation over the past 7-8 Gyrs. As the first paper in this series, we provide an overview of the episodic star formation history. We find that two branches of star formation typically develop during each episode: while one branch happens in heavily metal-enriched gas in the centers of galaxies, a secondary branch starts in lower-metallicity regions at galaxy outskirts where fresh gas first arrives, and gradually progresses to inner regions of galaxies. Additionally, the temporal variation in the SFR at galaxy outskirts is more significant than that at centers. As a consequence, the metallicities in both gas and young stars exhibit remarkably different distributions between SFR peaks and valleys. The resulting temporal SFR fluctuation within individual galaxies has an average of ~ 0.2 dex, while the intrinsic differentiation between (the historical mean of) galaxies is ~ 0.15 dex. These two together can well account for the scatter in SFR of ~ 0.25 dex as observed for z=0 star-forming main-sequence galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Shocks in astrophysical transients are key sites of particle acceleration. If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($\\Gamma_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($\\sigma_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $\\sigma_u \\gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $\\sigma_u \\gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as \"transition disks\") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \\gtrsim 0.01$ at $\\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M > 30$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M < 13$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $\\beta$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b.

Any energy injection from the dark sector can therefore be detected through these measurements. Dark compact objects and dark-matter substructures can modify the baryon temperature by transferring heat via dynamical friction. In this work, we evaluate the prospects for detecting dynamical friction-induced heating from dark compact objects with a mass in the range $10^2 M_{\\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\\odot}$, as well as from axion minihalos, using upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that both the 21-cm global signal and power-spectrum measurements will be sensitive to dark compact objects that constitute about 10% of the dark matter, and will substantially improve our sensitivity to axion-like particles with masses in the range $10^{-18}$ eV to $10^{-9}$ eV.",

In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (~2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.",

    "title": "Variable X-ray Emission of the Planet Hosting T Tauri Star CI Tau",
    "abstract": "We report results of Chandra X-ray observations of CI Tau, a young magnetically active classical T Tauri star for which previous studies have reported periodic variability attributed to a massive planet in a short-period orbit. CI Tau was clearly detected by Chandra in four separate observations acquired in late 2023. The X-ray emission was steady in the first two observations with a characteristic plasma temperature kT ~ 2 keV (~23 MK) and X-ray luminosity log Lx = 29.74 erg/s. During each of the last two observations obtained two weeks later the count rate increased slowly and the X-ray plasma temperature was much higher but remained nearly steady at kT ~ 4 - 5 keV (~46 - 58 MK) and peak luminosity log Lx = 30.5 erg/s. Such variable X-ray emission in T Tauri stars accompanied by high plasma temperatures is a signature of magnetic activity, consistent with the known presence of a strong magnetic field in CI Tau. We summarize the variable X-ray emission properties of CI Tau within the framework of T Tauri stars of similar mid-K spectral type, identify possible variability mechanisms, and assess the effects of stellar X-ray irradiation on the claimed planet.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been suggested that the typical separation between cores in molecular clouds dominated by turbulence is determined by the sonic scale, the size scale at which the turbulent velocity dispersion equals the sound speed. In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics.",

In this work, we validated the model inferences of the 1D-3D coupling models using 18 well-studied stars from the Kepler LEGACY Sample. We compared our estimates of the fundamental parameters determined with other six pipelines and obtained good consistency. The results indicate that the 1D-3D coupling models can be applied to characterizing solar-like stars with confidence. Our analysis showed similar pattern for the surface term in stars with effective temperature range from ~5000 K to ~6400 K, suggesting that the surface term of the 1D-3D coupling models is simpler and easier to deal with than that of models using classical atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of streamer-like structures around protostellar sources challenge the traditional picture of isolated, axisymmetric star formation. Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems.",

    "title": "Outward Migration of a Gas Accreting Planet: A Semi-Analytical Formula",
    "abstract": "Type II orbital migration is a key process to regulate the mass and semimajor axis distribution of exoplanetary giant planets. The conventional formula of type II migration generally predicts too rapid inward migration to reconcile with the observed pile-up of gas giant beyond 1 au. Analyzing the recent high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations by Li et al. (2024) and Pan et al. (2025) that show robust outward migration of a gas accreting planet, we here clarify the condition for the outward migration to occur and derive a general semi-analytical formula that can be applied for broad range of planet mass and disk conditions. The striking outward migration is caused by azimuthal asymmetry in corotation torque exerted from cicumplanetary disk regions (connecting to horseshoe flow) that is produced by the planetary gas accretion, while the conventional inward migration model is based on radial asymmetry in the torques from the circumstellar protoplanetry disk. We found that the azimuthal asymmetry dominates and the migration is outward, when the gap depth defined by the surface density reduction factor of $1/(1+K')$ is in the range of $0.03 \\lesssim K' \\lesssim 50$. Using simple models with the new formula, we demonstrate that the outward migration plays an important role in shaping the mass and semimajor axis distribution of gas giants. The concurrent dependence of planets' accretion rate and migration direction on their masses and disk properties potentially reproduces the observed pile-up of exoplanetary gas giants beyond 1 au, although more detailed planet population synthesis calculations are needed in the future.",

    "title": "Physicochemical Controls on the Compositions of the Earth and Planets",
    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the terrestrial planets formed from the protoplanetary disk, their compositions show marked departures from that of solar nebula condensates. Metallic cores fix oxygen fugacities ($f$O$_2$s) of the planets to 5 (Mercury) to 1 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer, orders of magnitude higher than the nebular gas. Their oxidised character is coupled with a lack of volatile elements with respect to the solar nebula. Condensates from a solar gas at different temperatures ($T_0$) have Fe/O (by mass) of 0.93 ($T_0$ = 1250 K) to 0.81 ($T_0$ = 400 K), far lower than that of Earth (1.06). Because the reaction Fe(s) + H2O(g) = FeO(s) + H2(g) proceeds <600 K, temperatures at which most moderately volatile elements (MVEs) have condensed, oxidised planets should be volatile-rich, and vice-versa. That this is not observed suggests that planets did not accrete from equilibrium nebular condensates and/or underwent additional volatile depletion/$f$O$_2$ changes. Indeed, MVEs in small telluric bodies (Moon, Vesta) indicate near equilibrium evaporation/condensation at IW-1 and 1400-1800 K. Volatile-depleted elemental yet near-chondritic isotopes of larger telluric bodies (Earth, Mars) reflect mixing of bodies of variable volatile depletion, overprinted by volatile-undepleted material. From the Cr- and Ti isotopes in the BSE, such undepleted matter has been proposed to be CI chondrites. 6% CI added late to an enstatite chondrite-like proto-Earth would match the Earth. However, because Earth is an end-member in isotopic anomalies of heavier elements, no combination of existing meteorites alone can account for its chemical- and isotopic composition. Instead, the Earth is made partially or essentially entirely from an NC-like missing component. If so, the oxidised-, yet volatile-poor nature of inner solar system bodies, including Earth and Mars, is intrinsic to the NC reservoir.",

    "abstract": "We explore the imprints of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the redshifted 21~cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization by employing the wavelet scattering transform (WST). FDM, composed of ultralight scalar particles with masses $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} \\sim 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, exhibits quantum pressure that suppresses the formation of small-scale structures below the de~Broglie wavelength, thereby delaying star formation and modifying the thermal history of the intergalactic medium. Using modified \\texttt{21cmFAST} simulations that incorporate both linear and nonlinear effects of FDM on structure formation, we analyze the two-dimensional 21~cm brightness temperature fields through the first- and second-order WST coefficients. The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise. Quantitatively, the WST coefficients yield pairwise distances of $\\Delta \\simeq 225$ between CDM and FDM with $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}}=10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, demonstrating that this framework can effectively discriminate between wave-like and cold dark matter scenarios even under realistic observational conditions.

The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations.",

The geometric and dynamical properties of weak stability boundary structures are firstly analyzed, which provides further insights into the training of the deep neural network models. Then, the optimal hyperparameter combinations are determined by examining the identification precision of the trained deep neural network models. The performance of the models with the optimal hyperparameter combinations is further validated using the representative test datasets, achieving the precision of 97.26-99.91%.

Meanwhile, Comparison with Yebes data reveals an extended, flattened CH3OH component. CCS and c-C3HD tend to be detected or non-detected together across cores, while cores near dust-rich regions on a large scale often lack both, suggesting environmental influences linked to the interstellar radiation field.

We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8\\sigma$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons. We also estimate the average ICM temperature and metallicity of $\\langle k_\\mathrm{B}T \\rangle=2.27\\substack{+0.15\\\\-0.11}\\thinspace$ keV and $\\langle Z\\rangle=0.19\\substack{+0.05\\\\-0.03}\\thinspace Z_\\odot$, respectively, from the 0.2-0.5$R_{500}$ annulus.

We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion.",

Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \\ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.",

    "abstract": "The recent data release DR2 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has reinforced compelling evidence supporting the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.",

The observations have enabled a precise characterization of the Fe-K emission lines from the accretion disk corona (ADC) and a possible detection of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). The ADC component has at least two distinct regions. The Fe-K emission lines are remarkably broad, with a velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v=2300^{+900}_{-700}$~km~s$^{-1}$. This can be larger than what was observed in previous Chandra observations ($1120\\pm870$~km~s$^{-1}$) and recent XRISM observations of the similar Z-source GX 340+0 (360--800~km~s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, we marginally detect a blueshifted absorption feature, which we identify as either \\ion{Fe}{26} or \\ion{Fe}{25}, with outflow velocities of $-0.29c$ or $-0.26c$, respectively.

    "abstract": "The Hilda population occupies the stable 3:2 mean-motion resonance of Jupiter and provides a window into Solar System evolution, including collisional processes. The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a simulation of Rubin's discovery of Hildas with the Sorcha (Merritt et al. 2025; Holman et al. 2025) survey simulator and the recovery of their light curves. We constructed a synthetic Hilda population model which includes distributions of orbital properties, sizes, collisional families and colors. We included two color classes corresponding to the Jupiter Trojan populations (Wong & Brown 2017). We applied three distinct populations of sinusoidal light-curves to this same orbit-size-color model: (1) a Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) fit to rotational periods and amplitudes from the Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al. 2009) (2) a super-fast rotator (SFR) population (0-3 hours) and (3) a super-slow rotator (SSR) population (100-1400 hours). Over the ten-year simulated survey, we predict LSST will discover ~33,400 Hildas, a fivefold increase over the known population. Using a multiband Lomb-Scargle Periodogram via Astropy (Price-Whelan et al. 2022) we confidently recover ~46.5% of Hildas in our LCDB-based population, higher than typical in observational searches. This suggests our light-curve population model may differ from the intrinsic population. We find strong biases in light-curve amplitude, with recovery efficiency dropping sharply below 0.1 magnitudes, while biases from rotational period are comparatively weak aside from cadence-related features such as LSST's ~36 minute revisit cadence. ...",

Anticipating the release of a uniform photometric calibration of the entire survey, we examine the properties of VPHAS+ ugriHa photometry of r < 19 mag. point sources in the third Galactic quadrant (longitudes 210^o to 260^o). We compare our interim calibration in gri with that of Pan-STARRS, the DECam Plane Survey (DECaPS-2) and Skymapper. We use the comparisons to identify small gri photometric offsets. Corrections to the Ha and u magnitude scales are determined via comparison with synthetic photometry. VPHAS+ and its northern counterpart, the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), are shown to closely align, where they overlap across the celestial equator. Aided by Gaia Data Release 3, SIMBAD, and specialist catalogues, we present selections of: A stars; sub-luminous stars; intrinsically-red luminous stars; young stellar objects; emission-line and OB stars. Attention is drawn to stellar variability as a contaminant in selecting emission line objects via (r - Ha) excess. It is argued the (r - i, r - Ha) plane is the better choice for this selection than (g - i, r - Ha). Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to ~7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6).",

    "abstract": "Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by intervening matter is a powerful probe of the cosmological model. In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies.",

Utilizing the short-exposure observations from the EUI High Resolution Imager in EUV (HRIEUV), we find small-scale blob/bead-like kernel structures propagating within a hook at the end of a flare ribbon, during the impulsive phase of a C9.9-class solar flare. These bead structures are dynamic, with well-resolved spatial separations as low as ~420-840 kilometers (3-6 pixels) - below the observable limit of full-disk solar imagers. We analyze the evolution of the plane-of-sky apparent velocity and separation of the flare ribbon structures, finding evidence for multiple processes occurring simultaneously within the flare ribbon. These processes include - quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP)-like brightenings, slow back-and-forth zig-zag motions along the ribbon, rapid apparent motions along the ribbon (600+ km/s), and stationary blob-like structures. Finally, we conduct Fast Fourier Transform analysis and analyze the start times of exponential growth in the power spectrum at different spatial scales across the flare ribbon. Our analysis reveals that the ribbon beads form with a key spatial separation of 1.7-1.9 Mm, before developing into more complex structures at progressively larger and smaller spatial scales. This observation is consistent with predictions of the tearing mode instability.",

We report the measurements of N, O, V, Zn, and Ba, and the upper limits for Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Eu for the first time. SMSS 0224$-$5737 exhibits low C abundance and high N and O abundances suggesting that C is converted to N by the enhanced mixing during the evolution. The abundance pattern up to the Fe-peak elements is generally in good agreement with the average abundance of EMP stars, although a notable feature is the high [Zn/Fe] ratio ([Zn/Fe] $= +0.88$). We confirm the enhancement of the first-peak neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Zr) and determine a low Ba abundance [Ba/H] $= -5.25$, that is, [Ba/Fe] $= -1.45$. The extremely high ratio of [Zr/Ba] $= +2.60$ makes SMSS 0224$-$5737 the EMP star with the most pronounced weak $r$-process signature observed to date. The abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements is compared with the yields from $r$-process nucleosynthesis models. The sharp decline in abundances beyond Zr disfavors neutron star merger or electron-capture supernova models, but are reproduced either by proto-neutron star wind models or by magneto-rotational supernova models. Considering the high [Zn/Fe] ratio, a magneto-rotational supernova is the most plausible origin of SMSS 0224$-$5737. This study demonstrates that the abundance measurements of both light and neutron-capture elements, even at low abundances, are crucial for unveiling the astrophysical sites of the weak $r$-process.",

We used the 0.5 -- 7.0 keV and 3.0 -- 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 -- 8.0 keV and 3.0 -- 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $\\gamma$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs.

We find that the E-P method cannot reproduce the inverse-square law, except over a narrow range of flux thresholds and even here we don't get pristine agreement. The main reason for the deviation is that the synthetic radio pulsar catalog is truncated based on a cut on the pulsar signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has a non-linear dependence on the flux along with plenty of scatter. We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold. We then demonstrate that if we create a synthetic catalog based on a flux cut (instead of an SNR-based threshold), we can recover the true distance exponent, with an accuracy ranging from pristine agreement to within $\\pm 1 \\sigma$ depending on the chosen flux threshold.",

    "abstract": "An asteroseismic analysis has revealed a magnetic field in the deep interior of a slowly-rotating main-sequence F star KIC9244992, which was observed by the Kepler spacecraft for four years. The star shows clear asymmetry of frequency splittings of high-order dipolar gravity modes, which cannot be explained by rotation alone, but are fully consistent with a model with rotation, a magnetic field and a discontinuous structure (glitch). Careful examination of the frequency dependence of the asymmetry allows us to put constraints on not only the radial component of the magnetic field, but also its azimuthal (toroidal) component. The lower bounds of the root-mean-squares of the radial and azimuthal components in the radiative region within 50 per cent in radius, which have the highest sensitivity in the layers just outside the convective core with a steep gradient of chemical compositions, are estimated to be $\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathrm{r}}^{\\min}=3.5 \\pm 0.1$ kG and $\\mathsf{B}_{\\phi}^{\\min}=92 \\pm 7$ kG, respectively. The much stronger azimuthal component than the radial one is consistent with the significant contribution of the differential rotation although the star has almost uniform rotation at present. The estimated field strengths are too strong to be explained by dynamo mechanisms in the radiative zone associated with the magnetic Tayler instability. The aspherical glitch is found to be located in the innermost radiative layers where there is a steep gradient of chemical composition. The first detection of magnetic fields in the deep interior of a main-sequence star sheds new light on the problem of stellar magnetism, for which there remain many uncertainties.",

    "title": "Tidal disruption and evaporation of rubble-pile and monolithic bodies as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A^\\star$",
    "abstract": "Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits frequent short-duration flares with luminosity greater than 1e34 erg/s across multiple wavelengths. The origin of the flares is still unknown. We revisited the role of small planetary bodies, originally from the stellar disk, and their tidally disrupted fragments as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A*. We refined previous models by incorporating material strength constraints on the tidal disruption limit and by evaluating the evaporation dynamics of the resulting fragments. We analyzed the tidal fragmentation and gas-induced fragmentation of small planetary bodies with rubble-pile and monolithic structures. Using constraints from recent space missions (e.g., NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2), we estimated the survivability of fragments under aerodynamic heating and computed their expected luminosity from ablation, modeled as fireball flares analogous to meteor events. We find that planetary fragments can approach as close as 8 gravitational radii, consistent with observed flare locations. The fireball model yields luminosities from 1e34 to 1e36 erg/s for fragments whose parent bodies are a few kilometers in size. The derived flare frequency vs. luminosity distribution follows a power law with index 1.83, in agreement with observed values (1.65 - 1.9), while the flare duration scales as L^(-1/3), consistent with observations. We consider the young stars around Sgr A* as the planetary reservoir. Given a small-body population analogous in mass to the primordial Kuiper belt and the common existence of close-in super-Earths and long-period Neptunes, we show that this planetary reservoir can supply the observed flares.",

    "abstract": "We study the multiplicity of galaxies in the largest sample of red-Herschel sources ($S_{250 \\mu \\mathrm{m}} < S_{350 \\mu \\mathrm{m}} < S_{500 \\mu \\mathrm{m}}$) using archival ALMA observations. Out of 2416 fields with ALMA detections (from a total of 3,089 analyzed maps), we identify 474 multiple systems within a radius of 16 arcsec (equivalent to the 500 $\\mu$m Herschel beam-size): 420 doubles, 51 triples, and 3 quadruples. In each case the brightest source contributes, on average, 64, 48, and 42 per cent of the total flux in double, triple, and quadruple systems. The average combined ALMA flux density of the sources in double systems is comparable to that of the two brightest components within triple and quadruple systems. Non-parametric tests suggest that only a small fraction of the double systems ($\\lesssim13$ per cent) are comprised of sources with compatible redshifts, while 47-67 per cent of triple and quadruple fields contain at least one potentially associated pair. Simulations using a mock catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies suggest that 32 per cent of the double systems are likely physically associated ($\\Delta z < 0.01$, i.e. $\\lesssim$10 comoving Mpc at $z = 3$) and, while only 8 per cent of the triple and none of the quadruple systems meet this criterion, $\\sim$ 70 per cent of them include at least one likely associated pair. Our results suggest that enhanced star formation rates in submillimetre galaxies are primarily driven by internal processes rather than large-scale interactions. This study also provides a catalog of potential overdensities for follow-up observations, offering insights into proto-cluster formation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "We present an empirical investigation into the relationship between galactic age and dark matter content across a sample of 16 nearby, well-resolved spiral galaxies. Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies. Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \\approx 0.91$; Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \\approx 0.91$; Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.",

Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.",

We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\\sim 3 \\sigma$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\\sim$ 48 days) reach $\\sim 4 \\sigma$.

    "abstract": "We compute the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric power (thermopower) of the inner crust of compact stars across a broad temperature-density domain relevant for proto-neutron stars, binary neutron-star mergers, and accreting neutron stars. The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance.",

    "abstract": "The search for potentially habitable exoplanets is a primary objective in modern astrophysics, yet the vast number of candidates discovered by missions like Kepler and TESS presents a significant challenge for detailed follow-up characterization. An efficient and reliable method for prioritizing the most promising targets is therefore essential. In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class. We establish a tiered framework of ideal ratios, beginning with $\\approx 108$ for G-type stars (anchored by the Earth-Sun system), and decreasing by a factor of two for K-type ($\\approx 54$) and M-type ($\\approx 27$) stars, respectively. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation, showing that exoplanets whose $d/D_s$ ratios are close to these empirically derived values consistently exhibit high Earth Similarity Index (ESI) scores. We propose that these tiered ratios represent \"Habitability Main Sequences,\" analogous to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stars, providing a valuable and straightforward tool for the astronomical community to rapidly screen large datasets and efficiently shortlist high-priority candidates for further investigation with next-generation observatories.",

However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.",

However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor. Our modular design enables direct adaptation to future photometric missions like PLATO or Earth 2.0.",

The relevant scattering matrix elements are calculated from one-plasmon exchange diagrams, with in-medium polarization tensors derived within hard-thermal-loop effective theory. Numerical results are obtained for matter composed of carbon nuclei. We find that the conductivity rises with temperature, following a power law sigma proportional to the 4th power of T in the semi-degenerate regime and sigma proportional to T in the nondegenerate regime, due to the intense creation of thermal electron-positron pairs and the resulting collisions among them. These results highlight the importance of including positrons in the transport properties of heated, dense astrophysical plasmas.",

We deployed pairs of telescopes for each emission line that were equipped with narrowband filters centered on, and several nanometers away from, the center wavelengths of the lines. The secondary continuum telescopes were used to measure and remove the combined continuum K- (electron) and F- (dust) corona, which dominate coronal emission at optical and infrared wavelengths. Significant emission was detected from all three lines from 1.03 solar radii (Rs) continuously outward to at least 6 Rs. The brightness of the lines and continuum are absolutely calibrated to the solar disk, and are validated by a comparison with LASCO-C2 observations made at the same time. Using these observations, we inferred the line emission ratios resolved throughout the middle-corona (defined as 1.5 to 6 Rs) for the first time. These line ratios are a probe of the electron temperature, which have important implications for constraining models of coronal heating and the characterization of solar wind formation, yet these emission lines have scarcely been quantified beyond 3 Rs in the corona. This study demonstrates the enduring potential of eclipse observations for coronal physics and suggests that future spacecraft missions could observe these lines farther out than has been attempted previously.",

WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope.",

    "title": "Relationship Between Major Stellar Physical Parameters and Normal Mode Frequencies in Accreting White Dwarf Stars",
    "abstract": "White dwarfs (WDs) are the final fate of about 97\\% of the stars in our galaxy, making them vital tracers of stellar history. A fraction of WDs exist in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems, accreting matter from a nearby companion star. A subset of CVs undergo episodic rapid mass transfer, termed dwarf novae (DNe) outbursts. Some accreting WDs exhibit near sinusoidal photometric variations, interpreted as $g$ mode pulsations. However, identifying pulsation modes in accreting WDs remains challenging due to the paucity of available observed modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive computation of the observable $g$ mode frequencies across a range of WD parameters, varying the WD mass, size of the newly accreted layer and core temperature. We also introduce a novel method for mode identification based on the time evolution of pulsation periods following an accretion episode. Our mode identification method does not rely on the direct detection of the consecutive radial mode orders, frequently required in isolated WDs. Moreover, this work improves upon our previous WD modeling efforts. We use a more realistic core temperature in addition to thermohaline mixing and element diffusion enabled during the accretion phase.",

    "abstract": "On April 17, 2024, the third successful Hi-C sounding rocket flight, Hi-C Flare, recorded coronal images in Fe XXI 129 A emission from 11 MK plasma during the post-maximum phase of an M1.6-class solar flare, achieving unprecedented spatial (~300 km) and temporal (1.3 s) resolutions. The flare started at 21:55 UT, peaked at 22:08 UT, and lasted ~40 minutes. Hi-C observed for over five minutes (22:15:45 to 22:21:25), starting roughly eight minutes after flare maximum. A sudden compact bright burst - 875 +/- 25 km wide, lasting 90 +/- 1.3 s, displaying a plane-of-sky motion of ~50 km/s toward the loop apex, and splitting into two toward the end - occurs near the foot of some post-flare loops. Its size and brightness are reminiscent of flare-ribbon kernels during a flare's rapid rise phase, kernels marking sites of sudden heating and hot plasma upflow, making its occurrence during the late phase surprising. Such isolated brightenings in a flare's post-maximum phase are rare, and have not been previously reported. The kernel was detected in all SDO/AIA channels. Its 1600 A light curve peaked ~50 s earlier than its 131 A light curve, similar to that of flare-ribbon kernels, albeit with a smaller delay of ~25 s, during the impulsive phase of the flare. In SDO/HMI magnetograms, the kernel sits in unipolar positive magnetic flux near an embedded clump of negative flux. Although localized magnetic reconnection within the kernel (a microflare) cannot be ruled out for its cause, the observations favor the localized brightening being an isolated, exceptionally late flare-ribbon kernel, resulting from an exceptionally late burst of the flare's coronal reconnection.",

    "abstract": "We present an investigation into the fate of disrupting near-Sun comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). Imaging observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), obtained 3--5 months after the reported disruption and the last sighting, constrained the primary component C/2019 Y4-B to an absolute magnitude of $H>20.5$ or a diameter of $D<0.5$~km (assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04) at an outbound heliocentric distance of 2.71~au. A search of shallower data obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, conducted when components A and B receded from 2.5 to 2.9~au from the Sun, yielded no detections, suggesting that the fragments had either ceased to exist or were not substantially active during this period. The uncertain fate of C/2019 Y4 highlights the challenge in understanding the state of presumably disrupted comets. Our review of six other presumably disrupted long-period comets reveals that negative confirmations were not reported for half of them, leaving their disruption presumptions inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the supernova remnants (SNRs) 3C 397 and W49B has long been a subject of debate, with prior studies offering conflicting interpretations between thermonuclear and core-collapse scenarios. To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$\\alpha$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations.",

    "abstract": "We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code to the extensively studied flare-productive active region 11158. We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment.",

    "abstract": "Interchange reconnection is believed to play a significant role in the production of solar jets and solar wind. However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales.",

Goat's Eye contains an interior radio structure that is likely a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which we analyse in further detail. We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($\\alpha = -0.60\\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($\\alpha = -0.16\\pm0.03$). We also measure the polarisation and magnetic field properties of the PWN. Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual \"zig-zag\"-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{bol}})\\in [44.3, 47.5] \\mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.",

    "abstract": "We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at this https URL , including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly one-off transients, we conducted systematic follow-up observations of 27 out of 81 non-repeating FRBs identified in the Parkes Transient Database. Using 59.0 hours of data from the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and 6.3 hours from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 19-beam receiver, we searched for repeated bursts from these sources. No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs. Combining these non-detections with prior archival observations, we derived stringent upper limits on their repetition rates above 1 Jy under two statistical models: Poisson process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.5}$ to $10^{-1.9}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, while Weibull process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.4}$ to $10^{-1.5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude stricter than those reported in previous studies. By applying consistent observational setups and analytical methodologies across all sources, the derived rate limits converge to a narrow, well-defined range. This suggests that these FRBs form a relatively homogeneous population with extremely low intrinsic activity rates.",

    "abstract": "Polarized radiation serves as a vital diagnostic tool in astrophysics, providing unique insights into magnetic field geometries, scattering processes, and three-dimensional structures in diverse astrophysical scenarios. To address these applications, we present Kratos-polrad, a novel GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code built upon the heterogeneous computing framework of Kratos, designed for self-consistent and efficient polarization calculations. It utlizes comprehensive treatment of Stokes parameters throughout photon propagation, featuring transforms the grain-lab frame transforms using quaternion algebra and consistent non-linear polarization extinction in cells, which are useful in modeling radiative transfer processes with scatterings by aligned dust grains. The code implements two-step polarimetry imaging that decouples Monte Carlo sampling of scattering physics from imaging geometry, enabling efficient synthesis maximizing the utilization of photon packets. Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations. By leveraging massive GPU parallelism, optimized memory access patterns, and analytical approaches for optically thick cells, Kratos-polrad achieves performance improvements of $\\sim 10^{2}$ times compared to CPU-based methods, enabling previously prohibitive studies in polarimetric astrophysics.",

    "abstract": "We use several smoothed particle hydrodynamics+N-body models as part of the GASTRO library to study the role of high-density star-forming clumpy regions and a single merger on the formation of the $\\alpha$-rich and $\\alpha$-poor populations in the disk galaxies. These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}<4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $>11$ Gyr, $\\alpha-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy.",

We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\\sim16$ kpc and $\\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($<30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended. Our results provide important clues to the assembly and evolution of the MW stellar halo under the standard cosmic structure formation framework.",

We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy--halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.75 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.41 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio).

Their Galactic production rate may be given by the number of stably mass transferring DWDBs in the Milky Way. The theoretical criteria for stable mass transfer in DWDBs is calculated assuming that component white dwarfs are completely cold and degenerate. Respective fractions of surviving AM CVn and DWDB which merge are then calculated by applying this criteria to population synthesis estimates for Galactic DWDB. However, emerging observations of the local DWDB population suggest that Helium white dwarf (He WD) components are typically hot, and only partially degenerate when they begin mass transferring. Using recent numerical simulations of He WD donors in DWDBs, we qualitatively describe a temperature dependent stable mass transfer criteria for Galactic DWDBs. Mass transfer is even more stable than previously thought, or equivalently, DWDB mergers are even rarer. Realistic finite temperature treatments will deepen the dearth in observed AM CVn binaries compared to DWDB merger products.",

We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events. Deviation from this number may raise concerns about our understanding of the evolution of such events over distance.",

Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube.",

Using {\\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $\\mu$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\\% are tightly clustered ($<$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\\sim$18 K and density $\\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars.",

One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.",

Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\\rm H}\\alpha$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.",

    "abstract": "In space plasmas, the rarity of collisions leads to complex structures in the velocity space where a turbulent cascade of the velocity distribution function fluctuations is thought to occur. Previous studies have explored this phenomenon using the Hermite decomposition of the ion velocity distribution function (VDF) in both magnetosheath data and numerical simulations. In this work, we investigate the Hermite spectrum of the ion VDFs measured by Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. We analyze a superalfvénic stream at a radial distances of $R \\approx 28 R_{sun}$ and a subalfvénic at $R \\approx 11 R_{sun}$, the former characterized by a prevalence of VDFs with suprathermal beams (also known as hammerhead). The Hermite analysis is also compared with various proxies of energization and dissipation, in order to establish a connection between turbulent cascades in real space and those in the velocity space. A qualitative agreement between the energization proxies and the Hermite analysis is observed. The results are suggestive of the presence of a dual cascade in real and velocity space.",

    "abstract": "Covariant density functionals have been successfully applied to the description of finite nuclei and dense nuclear matter. These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations.",

    "abstract": "In high-contrast imaging, a novel detection algorithm for angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences has recently been introduced: the Regime Switching Model (RSM). In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.",

    "abstract": "The Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey has secured high quality astro photometric data in two bands for 34 clusters never observed with HST. When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey.",

    "abstract": "Aims: We aim to characterize the physical and morphological properties of the binary system AFGL 4106, composed of two evolved massive stars. Understanding its mass-loss processes and circumstellar environment offers insight into the late stages of stellar evolution in massive binary systems. Methods: We obtained high-angular--resolution, high-contrast imaging using VLT/SPHERE with ZIMPOL (optical) and IRDIS (near-infrared) across multiple filters. We used aperture photometry to extract the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each star, and applied radiative transfer modelling to study the system and its surrounding dusty environment. Results: The observations resolve both components of the binary and unveil a complex, dusty nebula featuring asymmetric structures and cavities. SED fitting yields stellar temperatures of T$_1 = 6723\\pm196$ K and T$_2 = 3394\\pm264$ K, along with bolometric luminosities of L$_1 = (7.9 \\pm 0.18) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$ and L$_2 = (3.8 \\pm 0.11) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$. These values support the classification of the primary as being in a post-red supergiant (post-RSG) phase and the secondary as an active red supergiant (RSG). The luminosity ratio, combined with the inferred radii, indicates that both stars are at close yet distinct stages of their evolution. The binary is surrounded by an extended shell whose asymmetric morphology and large-scale features suggest interaction with the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM), and possibly the presence of a third, undetected companion. Conclusions: These observations provide the first resolved view of AFGL 4106's system and its dusty envelope. Our analysis sets constraints on the physical properties and evolutionary status of the system. This work contributes to understanding mass-loss processes in massive binaries and the shaping of nebulae around evolved stars.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\\sim$85% have [Fe/H]<-2, and that roughly $\\sim$17% have [Fe/H]<-3.",

The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s.

The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta.",

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) arrival times and impact geometry remain a major challenge for space-weather operations. Coronagraph-based techniques typically achieve mean absolute errors of order ten hours, while in situ measurements at L1 provide excellent magnetic-field information but only tens of minutes of warning. In this work we introduce X-CME, a framework that links in situ flux-rope reconstructions at intermediate heliocentric distances with a physics-based CME propagation model. The internal magnetic structure is obtained with an elliptical cylindrical, radial poloidal flux-rope model and embedded into a tapered torus CME geometry. The subsequent propagation is computed by solving a drag-based equation of motion in a Parker solar-wind background, including gravitational deceleration, self-similar expansion of the cross section, and an explicit calculation of the CME wetted area and swept area in the ecliptic plane. We apply X-CME to two events observed by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft, respectively, and propagate the reconstructed structures to Earth and Mars. For both cases, the model reproduces the observed in situ signatures at L1 and predicts the CME arrival time at Earth with errors of a few hours (typically about 2-4 hours), while correctly distinguishing between central encounters and glancing blows. These results demonstrate that combining intermediate-distance magnetic reconstructions with a geometrically consistent propagation scheme can substantially improve CME arrival-time forecasts and impact assessment in the inner heliosphere.",

    "abstract": "Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.",

    "abstract": "We present 22 sets of light curves and one radial velocity curve for the W UMa-type total eclipse contact binary system V2790 Ori, derived by combining all available public photometric data, the photometric data in previous studies, and our own spectroscopic and decade-long photometric observations. Our simultaneous analysis of the light curves and radial velocity curve shows that V2790 Ori is a W-subtype contact binary with a mass ratio of $q = 0.322(\\pm0.001)$ and a shallow contact degree of $14.8(\\pm0.6)\\%$. The orbital period analysis based on 445 eclipsing minima reveals a secular decrease at a rate of $\\dot P = -3.18 (\\pm 0.75) \\times 10^{-8}\\mathrm{d~yr^{-1}}$, superimposed with a cyclic variation with an amplitude of $A = 8.98 (\\pm 2.19) \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{d}$ and a period of $ P_3 = 7.44 (\\pm 0.52)~\\mathrm{yr}$. The secular decrease is caused by AML via magnetic braking, while the cyclic period variation is explained by the light-travel time effect due to a third body, which is likely to be a brown dwarf. Furthermore, our analysis indicates a mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one at a rate of $1.22(\\pm0.29) \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$. A model with a cool spot on each component was adopted to fit the O'Connell effect observed in the light curves. Since the O'Connell effect varies over time, we identified a solar-like magnetic activity cycle with a period of approximately 5.4 yr by analyzing the magnitude difference ($\\Delta m$) at the two light maxima and the O'Connell effect ratio. In addition, evolutionary analysis suggests that V2790 Ori is a newly formed contact binary that evolved from a detached phase into the present contact configuration.",

    "abstract": "Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses < 0.03 MSun.",

Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.",

    "abstract": "An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.",

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.",

Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars.

The observations were obtained approximately 30 minutes before the onset of the X1.2 flare. The active region exhibited strongly curved penumbral filaments, sunspot rotation, and shear motions along the polarity inversion line (PIL), which led to a highly stressed magnetic field configuration that stored sufficient energy to release multiple M- and X-class flares. The first flare signatures appeared as small-scale brightenings, each with a width of a few tenths of an arcsecond, that trace penumbral filaments in the trailing sunspot.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN) have shown the presence of millimeter emission, whose origin remains unknown, from within parsec scales of the central black hole. We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_{\\nu}\\sim{\\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\\rm mm}/L_X\\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions.",

    "abstract": "By combining high-resolution observations from JWST and HST, we have measured the stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and multi-wavelength morphologies of galaxies in the CANDELS fields. Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 $\\mu$m morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density ($\\Sigma_*$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at $0<z<4$ and $\\log(M_\\ast /M_{\\odot})>8$, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z>2.5$), the median radial profile of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $\\Sigma_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z>2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.",

    "abstract": "Much of a solar flare's energy is thought to be released in the continuum. The optical continuum (white light) is of special interest due to the ability to observe it from the ground. We aim to investigate the prevalence of white-light (WL) emissions in simulations of purely electron beam-driven solar flares, what determines the occurrence of these enhancements, and the underlying causes. We utilized the F-CHROMA grid of flare simulations created using the radiative hydrodynamics code RADYN. We probed the spectral index, total energy, and low-energy cutoff to draw conclusions about their relationships to the white-light intensity. Furthermore, we calculated the 6684 Å continuum intensities, the Balmer, and the Paschen ratios. Finally, we analyzed two particular cases, one with high 6684 Å intensity and one with a large Balmer ratio, to determine the dominant mechanisms in these simulations. 33 of the 84 flares included in the F-CHROMA grid show white-light intensity enhancements that exceed 0.1% relative to the pre-flare level. We conclude that, with the parameters presented in the F-CHROMA grid, purely electron beam-driven simulations of solar flares are not able to reproduce observed WL enhancements, as the maximum enhancements in the grid are below 4%. The total energy (which is correlated with the maximum beam flux) is the main factor for deciding whether excess white-light emissions will be detectable. There is a linear relationship between the Balmer (and Paschen) ratio and the relative continuum increase. Both case studies show that during the time of maximum WL excess, hydrogen ionization and subsequent recombination in an optically thin medium is the dominant mechanism for WL continuum emission enhancements. Increased H$^-$ emission in the photosphere as a result of radiative backwarming becomes dominant during the declining phase of WL emissions in both case studies.",

    "abstract": "With the giant exoplanet occurrence rate peaking around stars of 1.5-2 solar masses, there is strong motivation to characterize the disks that set their formation conditions. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O>1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O<1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks.",

We report 14 newly confirmed bona fide symbiotic stars and identify 6 additional strong candidates. Photometric variability was examined using our data and archival light curves from multiple all-sky surveys. Most systems are variable, with the majority showing periodic modulation consistent with orbital motion or pulsations. Possible photometric orbital periods are reported for 19 confirmed and 3 candidate systems, pending spectroscopic confirmation. Eight objects exhibit signs of outburst activity. In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf. The peculiar variability of another symbiotic star is best explained by dust-obscuration events. These results expand the census of Galactic symbiotic stars.",

The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\\sigma$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022.

    "abstract": "Sub-Neptunes represent the largest exoplanet demographic, yet their bulk compositions remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\\sim 100$ to $700\\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes.",

    "abstract": "We report the first observations in a rare family of class II methanol maser transitions in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward three southern high-mass star formation regions, along with the first maser detected in the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH line. The $8_2 \\rightarrow 9_1 A^{-}$ methanol transition was observed in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH (at 28.9 GHz and 41.9 GHz respectively) toward three sources; G358.93-0.03, NGC6334I and G345.01+1.79, all of which are star formation regions with recent maser flaring events. We report the first maser detection of the 41.9 GHz line in $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03 and the first confirmed maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward NGC6334I. Additionally we report a maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03, meaning that with our detection of the 41.9 GHz line, this is the first isotopic detection of these lines toward G358.93-0.03. The newly detected maser transitions are associated with the primary millimetre continuum sources (MM1) in both G358.93-0.03 and NGC6334I, within the varying positional uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "The fine structures of the solar chromosphere, driven by photospheric motions, play a crucial role in the dynamics of solar magnetic fields. Many have been already identified such as fibrils, filament feet, and arch filament systems. Still, high resolution observations show a wealth of structures that remain elusive. We have observed a puzzling, unprecedented chromospheric fibril singularity in close vicinity of a blow-out solar jet and a flaring loop. We aim to understand the magnetic nature of this singularity and the cause of its activity using coordinated high- resolution multi-wavelengths observations. We aligned datasets from Solar Orbiter, SST, IRIS, and SDO. We re-projected the Solar Orbiter datasets to match the perspective of the Earth-based instruments. We performed potential field extrapolations from Solar Orbiter/PHI data. We analysed the spatial and temporal evolution of the plasma structures and their link with the surface magnetic field. This leads us to derive a model and scenario for the observed structures which we explain in a general schematic representation. We have discovered a new feature, a singularity in the chromospheric fibril pattern. It is formed in a weak magnetic field corridor between two flux concentrations of equal sign, at the base of a vertically inverted-Y shape field line pattern. In this specific case some activity develops along the structure. Firstly a flaring loop at one end, secondly a blow-out jet at the other end, where a coronal null-point was present and associated with a chromospheric saddle point being located onto the fibril singularity.

    "abstract": "We analyzed archival Herschel observations of water vapor emission toward the Horsehead photon dominated region (PDR), along with supporting ground-based and airborne observations of CO isotopologues and fine structure lines of ionized and atomic carbon to determine the distribution and abundance of water vapor in this low-UV illumination PDR. Water emission in the Horsehead nebula is very weak and, surprisingly, extends outward beyond other PDR tracers such as $^{12}$CO or [CI] 609 $\\mu$m, reaching as far out as [CII] 158 $\\mu$m. We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within ~40\\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed. Water vapor abundance in the model reaches $3.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ at $A_V \\sim 3$ mag. However, the ground state $o$-H$_2$O 557 GHz line is systematically overestimated by the models by at least a factor of 7 for any values of the model parameters. This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required.",

    "abstract": "We present the characterization of the TOI-6041 system, a bright ($V = 9.84 \\pm 0.03$) G7-type star hosting at least two planets. The inner planet, TOI-6041b, is a warm Neptune with a radius of $4.55^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\\,R_\\oplus$, initially identified as a single-transit event in \\textit{TESS} photometry. Subsequent observations with \\textit{TESS} and \\textit{CHEOPS} revealed additional transits, enabling the determination of its $26.04945^{+0.00033}_{-0.00034}$~d orbital period and the detection of significant transit timing variations (TTVs), exhibiting a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 1~hour. Radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the APF spectrographs allow us to place a $3\\sigma$ upper mass limit of $28.9\\,M_\\oplus$ on TOI-6041b. In addition, the RV data reveal a second companion, TOI-6041c, on an 88~d orbit, with a minimum mass of $0.25\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. A preliminary TTV analysis suggests that the observed variations could be caused by gravitational perturbations from planet c; however, reproducing the observed amplitudes requires a relatively high eccentricity of about 0.3 for planet c. Our dynamical stability analysis indicates that such a configuration is dynamically viable and places a $1\\sigma$ upper limit on the mass of TOI-6041c at $0.8\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. An alternative is the presence of a third, low-mass planet located between planets b and c, or on an inner orbit relative to planet b -- particularly near a mean-motion resonance with planet b -- which could account for the observed variations. These findings remain tentative, and further RV and photometric observations are essential to better constrain the mass of planet b and to refine the TTV modeling, thereby improving our understanding of the system's dynamical architecture.",

    "abstract": "The upcoming era of large scale, high cadence astronomical surveys demands efficient and robust methods for time series analysis. ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis.",

With the rise of satellites, mobile networks, and other wireless technologies, radio telescopes are struggling with radio frequency interference (RFI), which can masquerade, block or distort astronomical signals. In this chapter, we explain where RFI comes from, how it affects observations, and discuss different ways to reduce or remove interference. The techniques presented here reflect the state of the art in real-time RFI mitigation at the time of publication and include methods such as filtering, digital processing, and optimal scheduling. The proposed catalogue also explores new ideas like satellite avoidance through scheduling, the use of intelligent surfaces to block interference, and advanced computer algorithms to clean up data. The chapter also highlights the need for strong cooperation between astronomers and spectrum regulators to protect radio frequencies for future discoveries. By combining technical solutions and better policies, we can help ensure that radio astronomy continues to provide important insights into the universe.",

We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \\gtrsim 50\\ h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.",

With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature -- due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features -- making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$\\alpha$ star formation rate of SFR$_{H\\alpha} = 0.024 \\pm 0.001$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most \"star-forming\" clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable H$\\beta$ emission, we find (for the first time at $z>5$) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions -- highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.",

    "abstract": "Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\\mathrm{eff} = \\, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.",

By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.",

This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology.",

    "title": "Cosmology of Gravi-Axions",
    "abstract": "We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \\sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.",

We surveyed 6,114 highly educated and scientifically engaged individuals (77.60% bachelor's degree+; 67.99% high-to-very-high scientific engagement) to assess their beliefs about extraterrestrial intelligent life existence: (1) personal beliefs, (2) perceived social circle beliefs, (3) perceived expert beliefs, and (4) responses to expert consensus revelation. Results showed 95.01% believed extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, with 62.59% holding definitive rather than probable convictions. Participants exhibited massive pluralistic ignorance, a 'cosmic closet', underestimating social circle beliefs by 46.07 percentage points despite near-universal personal conviction. Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14). These findings demonstrate that consensus misperception operates along two dimensions, prevalence and intensity, and that even scientifically engaged audiences resist belief revision via expert consensus information.",

    "abstract": "For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. \"Science anxiety\" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled \"The Movements of the Universe\", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.",

    "abstract": "While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Source extraction is crucial in analyzing data from next-generation, large-scale sky surveys in radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.",

To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.",

For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible.

To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum.

    "abstract": "Between the linear and nonlinear regimes, we identify a universal transition range centered on a characteristic halo mass $m_h^*\\propto t$, within which gravitational dynamics self-organize the matter field toward an effective spectral index n=-1. In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\\tau_g\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$ and $\\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\\tau_{gr}\\propto r^{-\\gamma}$, yielding density $\\rho_r\\propto r^{-2\\gamma}$ and $\\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\\varepsilon_u \\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration.

Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (> 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.",

    "abstract": "We perform the first 3D ab-initio general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant spanning a fraction of its cooling time scale. We find that neutrino cooling becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism after the gravitational-wave dominated phase (${\\sim}20\\ {\\rm ms}$ postmerger). Electron flavor anti-neutrino luminosity dominates over electron flavor neutrino luminosity at early times, resulting in a secular increase of the electron fraction in the outer layers of the remnant. However, the two luminosities become comparable ${\\sim}20{-}40\\ {\\rm ms}$ postmerger. A dense gas of electron anti-neutrinos is formed in the outer core of the remnant at densities ${\\sim}10^{14.5}\\ {\\rm g}\\ {\\rm cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to temperature hot spots. The neutrinos account for ${\\sim}10\\%$ of the lepton number in this region. Despite the negative radial temperature gradient, the radial entropy gradient remains positive and the remnant is stably stratified according to the Ledoux criterion for convection. A massive accretion disk is formed from the material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the stars. The disk carries a large fraction of the angular momentum of the system, allowing the remnant massive neutron star to settle to a quasi-steady equilibrium within the region of possible stable rigidly rotating configurations. The remnant is differentially rotating, but it is stable against the magnetorotational instability. Other MHD mechanisms operating on longer timescales are likely responsible for the removal of the differential rotation. Our results indicate the remnant massive neutron star is thus qualitatively different from a protoneutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae.",

    "abstract": "Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for $\\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.",

    "abstract": "Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. Our aim is to constrain the physical mechanism responsible for the second optical flare, which may also provide clues to the origin of the initial event. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient and a uniquely bright UV counterpart. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conslusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. We propose a repeating TDE scenario within an AGN framework to explain the multi-wavelength properties of AT2019aalc and suggest a possible connection among ECLEs, BFFs, and TDEs occurring in AGNs.",

    "abstract": "A goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize true Earth-analogs. However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown dynamically disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be surveyed, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle. Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first observations going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 $\\rm M_\\oplus$. We also provide updated parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect at least 26 additional RV signals corresponding to stellar activity and 4 signals that are planet candidates. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.",

    "abstract": "With the next generation of big telescopes such as the ELT and SKA it might become possible to measure changes in the expansion rate of the Universe in real time by measuring the change of the redshifts of a large number of galaxies over a period of the order of 10 years. This phenomenon, known as 'redshift drift,' will provide a crucial direct test of cosmological models. The change in redshift is readily explained using the concept of conformal time which is the comoving distance of a galaxy in lightyears. We emphasize that the redshift drift is directly proportional to the average change in the cosmic expansion rate between the time of a galaxy's light emission and its absorption. This phenomenon is illustrated within the framework of the concordance model, the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.",

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio Mähönen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.",

While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, by considering BH mergers within SIDM spikes, which can arise from models with a massive force mediator, we show that the GWs emitted are dephased in a distinct manner. To incorporate the feedback of the BH orbital motion that can significantly modify the DM profiles, we use $N$-body simulations to analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.",

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\\xi$), position-orientation ($\\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\\xi$ and ~5% for $\\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\\sim$10,000$\\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.",

    "abstract": "Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets for atmospheric characterization, yet their long-term evolution under intense stellar winds and high-energy radiation remains poorly constrained. The Kepler-1649 system, hosting two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, provides a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric evolution in the extreme environments typical of M-dwarf systems. In this Letter we show that both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales. Using a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion escape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.8 to 4.0 Gyr. The results reveal a clear decline in total ion escape rates with stellar age, as captured by a nonparametric LOWESS regression, with O$^{+}$ comprising 98.3%-99.9% of the total loss. Escape rates at 4.0 Gyr are two to three orders of magnitude lower than during early epochs. At 0.8 Gyr, planet b exhibits 3.79$\\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c, whereas by 4.0 Gyr its O$^{+}$ escape rate becomes 39.5$\\times$ lower. This reversal arises from a transition to sub-magnetosonic star-planet interactions, where the fast magnetosonic Mach number, $M_f$, falls below unity. Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion, both planets may have retained significant atmospheres, suggesting potential long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into atmospheric retention in the Kepler-1649 system and inform future JWST observations of similar M-dwarf terrestrial exoplanets aimed at refining habitability assessments.",

This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \\cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}.

Here, we present new experimental and theoretical evidence that challenges this assumption. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with \\ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism, indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, and that further investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space--a process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation and growth--is essential.",

This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension this http URL molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.",

    "title": "The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Parameter R$_ρ$",
    "abstract": "Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and \"fuzzy\" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the parameter $R_{\\rho}$, which allows one to explore in an approximate way the efficiency of semiconvection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.",

    "title": "Bayesian Posteriors with Stellar Population Synthesis on GPUs",
    "abstract": "Models of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) provide a predictive framework for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy. SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1000$ galaxy posteriors per minute on a single GPU. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.",

    "title": "Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?",
    "abstract": "Assuming a minimal $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$. This preference increases to $\\sim 2.5$-$3\\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\\sum m_\\nu \\ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.",

Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.",

    "abstract": "Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.",

    "abstract": "Radio sources with steep and ultra-steep spectra, identified through a series of surveys of the Cold experiment using the RATAN-600 radio telescope, formed the basis of the Big Trio program aimed at discovering distant radio galaxies. With the advent of new radio, optical, and infrared sky surveys, it became possible to carry out additional studies of the 113 radio sources observed within this program using the 6-meter BTA telescope. Morphological features indicative of the evolutionary state of radio sources revealed that 9 objects exhibit signs of restarted activity, 12 can be classified as young, and 2 as dying. Based on their WAT/NAT and WRS morphologies, 24 sources are likely located within galaxy groups or clusters, or show evidence of jet reorientation. Additionally, four objects in the sample represent pairs of radio sources whose host galaxies are separated by only a few tens of kiloparsecs. Continuum spectra were constructed, and variability indices were calculated. A high proportion of sources with a variability index ($V>3$) is attributed to significant differences in angular resolution between the TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as to underestimated flux densities for certain double-lobed sources. A comparison of spectral indices derived from older and newer data indicates a decrease in the number of steep-spectrum sources in the sample. This reduction is most likely due to improved characterization of the low-frequency portion of the continuum spectra following the incorporation of GLEAM data. However, for some radio sources, the observed spectral changes may reflect internal evolution, that observed in a shift of the spectral peak or a roll-off in the radio spectrum towards lower frequencies, as evidenced by flux density measurements from various catalogues covering a period of up to forty years.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with ''bumps'' in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called ''super-Chandrasekhar\") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\\rm log}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. The current leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model involves an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. We test the validity of this theory by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass in the range $M_\\mathrm{CSM}=3.31-8.51 \\times 10^{-3} M_\\odot$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.",

    "abstract": "Context. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, and it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it. Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties such as eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay, and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale. Methods. We primarily made use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complementary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and to see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantified the criteria for ELP flare definition and determined the characteristics of the flares. Results. Our analysis shows that about 10\\% of all flares with a GOES class $\\geq$C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energy counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flare are confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population ($\\geq$C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.",

    "abstract": "Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \\sim 0.67\\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\\gtrsim6\\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.",

In this study, we adopted 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 out of 12 cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.05$, while the other two cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derived the chemical properties of each structure. For the stellar ages, our models recovered the negative gradients in the bars and discs, but exhibited relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components were constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\\rm model}-t_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\lesssim1\\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduced the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, as well as all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the discs and halos.

We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. This evolutionary path would naturally explain many of the problematic characteristics of Little Red Dots, including that these objects are probably transient in the history of the Universe, that most of them would not emit X-rays since they would not yet have become massive black holes, and once they do, they would constitute a significant portion of the mass of the Little Red Dots. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range",

We consider $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ and $W_\\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\\beta_\\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$, $W_\\lambda$([OIII]) and $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ or $W_\\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}\\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\\sim0.15\\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\\sigma_\\rm{int}\\sim0.035\\,$dex.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass. In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \\texttt{photomass\\ this http URL } to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\\%. For both\\,--\\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.",

    "abstract": "X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny \"campfires\" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU. We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior. These picoflares, spanning $10^{20}$--$10^{24}$ erg, were detected by the Solar Orbiter EUI Imager while the spacecraft was at 0.56 AU from the Sun. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.",

    "title": "Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks",
    "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.",

    "abstract": "We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\\rm rad}> 10\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\\vert \\mathbf{B}\\vert_{\\rm max}>10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.",

We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow.

    "title": "Sub-Snowline Formation of Gas-Giant Planets in Binary Systems",
    "abstract": "Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 17 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates an inner dust trap. After removing evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars) and higher-order systems, we find that gas giants position is a linear function of the truncation radius. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, evolved systems are generally inconsistent with the predictions, which further supports the model and points to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.",

Using $\\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\\,\\rm Z_\\odot$ for M$_\\star$ $\\approx5\\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\\sim L^\\star$ galaxies.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.",

    "title": "Formation of millisecond pulsar-helium star binaries",
    "abstract": "PSR J1928+1815, the first recycled pulsar-helium (He) star binary discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, consists of a 10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\\,M_{\\sun}$ in a 0.15-day orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE this http URL this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \\texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \\texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\\alpha_{\\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 5.2$\\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).",

    "abstract": "We investigate how the cosmological Euler equation can be tested in the presence of viscous dark matter, violations of the equivalence principle (EP), and modifications of gravity, while relying on minimal theoretical assumptions. Extending the previous analysis, we generalize the observable $E_P$, which quantifies EP violation, to $\\tilde{E}_P$, discuss the degeneracy between bulk and shear viscosities and EP-violating effects, and explicitly show that the EP can still be tested in the small-viscosity limit. In addition, we identify a model-independent observable, $C_{\\rm vis,0}$, which characterizes the present-day dark matter viscosity and can be measured from relativistic galaxy number counts by cross-correlating two galaxy populations. We perform forecasts for three forthcoming Stage-IV surveys: DESI, Euclid, and SKA Phase 2 (SKA2), and find that $C_{\\rm vis,0}$ can be tightly constrained, at the level of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ or better in all cases.

    "title": "Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts",
    "abstract": "The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.",

    "abstract": "The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.",

    "abstract": "The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary \"bones\" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.",

Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\\it Planck}$, ${\\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5\" resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\\rm core}^{\\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\\rm gas}^{\\rm bound}$), $M_{\\rm core}^{\\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\\sigma$, rising to $3.63\\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.",

In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed.

The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\\Lambda$ at $<10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.",

In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars.

We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle.

    "abstract": "We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \\mathcal{O}(10)\\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \\ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\\Lambda$ + axion framework.",

We review two arguments for using the Schrödinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.",

    "abstract": "The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M2 is a $2\\times2$ multi-anode 2-inch photomultiplier tube that offers a compact form factor, low intrinsic radioactivity, and high photocathode coverage. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for next-generation xenon-based direct detection dark matter experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT. We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\\pm0.2)\\;\\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called \"projective decomposition\". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.",

We newly derive the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and show that the quadrupole moment contributes to the periapsis shift apparently as in the 2PN order. Applying this formula to observational data on S2, a star orbiting closely to Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), we show that the parameter $\\gamma$ is constrained to $\\gamma \\gtrsim 1.9 \\times 10^{-2}$ for the gravitational field of Sgr A*.

The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.",

    "abstract": "Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.",

The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.",

The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.",

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\\alpha^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",

    "abstract": "Infrastructure parts for a hydrogen (H) economy need alloys that are mechanically strong and at the same time resistant to the most dangerous and abrupt type of failure mode, namely, H embrittlement. These two properties are in fundamental conflict, as increasing strength typically amplifies susceptibility to H-related failure. Here, we introduce a new approach to make alloys resistant to H embrittlement, by creating a topological passivation layer (up to a few hundred micrometers thick) near the material surface, the region that is most vulnerable to H ingress and attack. It features instead a layer of ultrafine laminated grains with tens of times higher dislocation density than conventional materials, altering H diffusion, trapping and crack evolution. We tested the concept on a face-centered cubic (FCC) CoCrNi medium entropy model alloy which undergoes severe H-induced intergranular cracking. Two key mechanisms create the topological passivation: First, the high density (up to ~1.3e15 m-2) of H-trapping dislocations within the passivating grain layer decelerates H migration by up to about an order of magnitude, delaying H-induced crack initiation at grain boundaries. More importantly, once unavoidable micro-sized H-induced intergranular cracks emerge in the topmost surface region, they become completely arrested by the laminated grains, due to a transition in the embrittlement mechanism from H-enhanced grain boundary decohesion to highly energy-dissipative dislocation-associated cracking. These effects almost completely eliminate H embrittlement, at even doubled yield strength, when exposing the so architected material to harsh H attack. Our approach leverages surface mechanical treatments to tailor metallic microstructures in surface regions most susceptible to H attack, providing a scalable solution to protect alloys from H-induced damage.",

Large-scale analysis of 5,682 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database shows that most frameworks are formally over-constrained yet cluster sharply near the isostatic threshold, revealing accidental geometric modes and placing many MOFs near mechanical instability. In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable. This near-criticality mirrors behavior known from topological mechanics and points to a deeper design principle in porous crystals.",

In particular, we consider a strongly spin-polarized metallic ferromagnet coupled to two superconducting leads via thin spin-active (left) and non-spin-active (right) insulating layers. The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations. Using a diagrammatic technique for ballistic propagators introduced in Refs. [1-3], we describe the relevant Andreev processes responsible for the effective conversion of two spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two $\\uparrow\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow\\downarrow$ pairs in the ferromagnet. Contrary to the naive picture of direct conversion, we show that the lowest order process involves four Cooper pairs in the superconductor, among which three are incoming, and one is outgoing, giving rise to net charge transport of 4e across the non-spin-active interface. The self-consistent numerical treatment of the diffusive junction, typically more relevant in experiments, confirms this picture quantitatively.",

In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.",

For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality.",

The ability of these soft materials to deform is crucial for the proper functioning of various biological processes, such as blood flow in our veins and arteries. It is vital to understand how deformability influences the normal functioning of these processes. We have investigated an assembly of two-dimensional (2D) polymeric non-overlapping rings via extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The main idea is to study an assembly of model particles with anisotropic deformability using polymer rings. By tuning the degree of deformability of these model deformable particles, we study the dynamic and static properties of the assembly at different densities and temperatures. This deformable particle model might correspond to an assembly of epithelial cells or similar biologically soft bodies. In the limit at which the rings are very rigid with very little deformability, one expects to see the formation of a triangular lattice by the centres of these polymer rings. On the other hand, if one increases the deformability of these polymer rings, due to increased disorder, one observes glass-like dynamical behaviour even for identically sized polymer rings. We also show a transition from a crystalline state to a disordered glassy state driven solely by particle deformability. We observe non-trivial finite-size effects in the dynamics of these glass-forming ring polymers, not seen in usual molecular glass-formers.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \\neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.",

    "abstract": "Surface alignment of a recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) is usually achieved by buffed polymer films, which produce a unidirectional polar alignment of the spontaneous electric polarization. We demonstrate that photosensitive polymer substrates could provide a wider variety of alignment modes. Namely, a polyvinyl cinnamate polymer film irradiated by linearly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light yields two modes of surface orientation of the NF polarization. (1) A planar apolar mode, in which the equilibrium NF polarization aligns perpendicularly to the polarization of normally impinging UV light; the NF polarization adopts either of the two antiparallel states. (2) A planar polar mode, produced by an additional irradiation with obliquely impinging UV light. In this mode, there is only one stable azimuthal direction of polarization in the plane of the substrate. The two modes differ in their response to an electric field. In the planar apolar mode, polarization can be switched between two states of equal surface energy. In the planar polar mode, the field-perturbed polarization relaxes back to the single photoinduced easy axis once the field is switched off. The versatility of modes and absence of mechanical contact make the photoalignment of the NF attractive for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Flagellated microswimmers B. Subtilis dispersed in a nematic phase of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal form a living liquid crystal (LLC). The combination of the passive and active components allows us to analyze how the active component transitions from the shear-imposed alignment into topological turbulence. The lateral extension of the experimental cell is 1000 times larger than the 10-micrometer thickness, to avoid the effect of lateral confinement on the dynamic patterns. The surface anchoring is azimuthally degenerate to avoid permanent anisotropy. After the shear cessation, active forces produced by the microswimmers trigger self-amplifying bend undulations. The amplitude of undulations grows with time and then saturates, while the wavelength increases only slightly. Strong bend stresses at the extrema of undulations are released by nucleating disclination pairs, which multiply to produce topological turbulence. The nucleating pairs and the symmetry axes of the +1/2 disclinations are orientationally ordered. In highly active LLCs, this alignment causes a nonmonotonous time dependence of the disclinations' number, as a fast-moving +1/2 disclination of one pair annihilates a -1/2 disclination of the neighboring pair. The spectra of elastic and kinetic energies exhibit distinct wavevector dependencies caused by the energy cost of the deformed passive nematic background. The study demonstrates how applied shears and a passive viscoelastic background affect the dynamics of active matter. Combined with the previously determined viscoelastic properties of the lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, the results complete a comprehensive description of the experimentally assessable type of active matter.",

We characterize the system dynamics in terms of the polarization or imbalance between the atoms and molecules, and the system coherence. The relaxation times corresponding to these two quantities are studied both using a mean-field model, and a Born Green Kirkwood Yvon hierarchy that takes into account the higher-order correlations. The role of the initial polarization and the Feshbach detuning are investigated. It is found with an increasing initial population imbalance, the longituidinal relaxation time (that governs the dyanamics of the polarization) grows, while the transverse relaxation time (that governs the dynamics of the coherence) decays. As for the varying Feshbach detuning, it is observed that the longituidinal relaxation time reaches its minima and its transverse counterpart reaches its maxima near the resonance. We also study how the initial polarization and the detuning affect physical quantities like drift speed, condensate fraction, fidelity and entanglement entropy etc, and find the results to be fully consistent with the behavior of the relaxation dynamics of the system.",

    "abstract": "Delafossites (ABC2, where A and B are metals and C is a chalcogen) are a versatile family of quantum materials and layered oxides/chalcogenides whose properties are highly sensitive to atomic composition and stacking geometry. Their broad chemical tunability makes them an ideal platform for large-scale combinatorial exploration and high-throughput computational screening with desirable quantum properties. In this work, we employ a Concept Whitening Graph Neural Network, a gray-box AI model, to classify delafossite structures by stacking sequence and magnetic states. By aligning learned representations with human-interpretable physical concepts, this gray-box approach enables both accurate prediction and insight into the structural and chemical features driving magnetic behavior. The magnetic-ordering models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 80 percent, with a further slight uptick observed in the model incorporating the largest number of concepts. Concept alignment analysis revealed measurable learning across nine physically meaningful descriptors, with coefficients of determination ranging from approximately 0.6 for the d-shell valence-electron concepts to 0.4-0.5 for the magnetic coupling parameters. Furthermore, we mapped the concept importances onto the material graph representation, elucidating interpretable physical trends and the progression of stable concept-aligned regions across training. These results demonstrate the potential of interpretable graph-based learning to capture the underlying physics of complex materials systems and provide an interpretable framework for accelerating the discovery and understanding of delafossites and related crystalline materials.",

These two defect classes drive the electronic structure in opposing directions. Vacancy-induced disorder generates local magnetic moments and promotes Anderson localization at moderate concentrations, whereas periodic interstitial ordering yields a coherent but weakly correlated metallic background that fails to support superconductivity.

The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs.",

We present a combined first-principles and experimental study of epitaxial Fe5Si3 thin films, establishing them as a magnetic Weyl nodal-line material. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unambiguously reveal that Fe5Si3 hosts a topologically nontrivial electronic structure containing six pairs of Weyl nodes at or near the Fermi level, accompanied by pronounced Berry curvature at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin Zone. High-quality epitaxial films exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ~370 K and strong magneto crystalline anisotropy. The magneto transport measurements on epitaxial films reveal the corresponding Berry curvature-driven responses, including a significantly large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 504 S/cm and a high anomalous Hall angle of 5.5%, which is in good agreement with DFT calculations. A negative and non-saturating longitudinal magnetoresistance is observed, consistent with a chiral-anomaly contribution from Weyl fermions near the Fermi level (EF). Furthermore, a substantial topological Hall resistivity of 1.6 {\\mu}{\\Omega} cm robust across a wide temperature range, indicating the possibility of robust chiral spin textures in the thin-film geometry.

In this paper, we consider two-dimensional noninteracting fermionic systems whose Fermi surface has nonvanishing Berry curvature. We find that the Berry curvature at the Fermi surface does not affect the quantized nonlinear transport for translationally invariant systems. When spatial inhomogeneity is introduced, such quantization breaks down due to the combined effect of Berry curvature and the gradient of local potential. Such breakdown of quantization can be observed in trapped ultracold atoms with topological bands.",

In this work, we develop an accurate machine-learned potential NEP-C$_{24}$ for both the quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) and the quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) C$_{24}$ monolayers, based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework. Using this NEP-C$_{24}$ model, we systematically investigate the elastic and thermal transport properties. Compared with C$_{60}$ monolayers, both C$_{24}$ phases exhibit markedly enhanced stiffness, arising from the combination of reduced molecular size and increased density of covalent bonds. The qTP C$_{24}$ monolayer shows nearly isotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivities along its two principal axes owing to its four-fold symmetry, whereas the chain-like, misaligned bonding topology of the qHP C$_{24}$ monolayer leads to pronounced in-plane anisotropy. Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and spectral decomposition analyses reveal that low-frequency ($<5$ THz) acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, with directional variations in phonon group velocity and mean free path governing the anisotropic response in qHP C$_{24}$. Real-space heat flow visualizations further show that, in these fullerene networks, phonon transport is dominated by strong inter-fullerene covalent bonds rather than weak van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a direct link between intermolecular bonding topology and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing guidance for the rational design of fullerene-based two-dimensional materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties.",

We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties.

We find an approximately tenfold enhancement of chiral-phonon coupling in the helical spin state along the screw axis, compared with both the paramagnetic and collinear spin states.

The free energy landscape is predicted using metadynamics simulation, an enhanced sampling method. A direct comparison with the theoretical free energy formulation proposed in the literature allows us to introduce a modification related to the entropic contribution in the theory.

    "abstract": "We report on the realization of a planar, quasi-ballistic Josephson junction array using a Au micron-sized single-crystal. The system exhibits a nonlocal, multiterminal Josephson effect, where the supercurrent between any two superconducting leads is governed by the phase coherence across the entire crystal. Key evidence includes a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on junction length and magnetic interference patterns with periods corresponding to the shared normal-metal area. Nonlocal transport measurements further confirm that the supercurrent between two electrodes depends on the phase configuration of all the others. Our results, supported by a developed theoretical model, establish a platform for exploring complex superconducting phenomena in multiterminal ballistic systems.",

    "abstract": "We develop a theoretical framework for planar quasi-ballistic Josephson junctions, where multiple superconducting leads are coupled through a large, nearly ballistic normal metal crystal. Our approach, based on quasiclassical Eilenberger equations, accounts for the dominant role of electron reflections from the crystal surfaces or single impurities, a mechanism distinct from both purely ballistic and diffusive limits. We calculate the critical current between superconducting leads for various geometries, examining its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. Crucially, we demonstrate that in multi-terminal setups, the junctions are not independent but form a strongly coupled system. The theory successfully explains key experimental observations from a companion work, including a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on the interlayer length, providing a foundation for designing and understanding complex multi-terminal Josephson systems.",

The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed.

    "abstract": "Graphene has emerged as a promising material for next-generation electronic and thermal devices owing to its exceptional charge transport and thermal conductivity. However, high-quality samples are predominantly obtained via mechanical exfoliation from graphite crystals, a process that inherently lacks scalability. Despite extensive efforts toward large-area synthesis, cost-effective approaches for producing high-quality, large-area, single-crystalline graphene with fast turnaround time remain limited. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance benchmarking of a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system capable of synthesizing epitaxial monolayer graphene under atmospheric pressure. The entire growth process, from sample loading to unloading, is achieved within $25$ minutes with a temperature ramp rate exceeding $23^\\circ\\mathrm{C}/s$. Growth at atmospheric pressure eliminates the need for vacuum components, thereby reducing both system complexity and operational costs. The structural and electronic quality of epitaxial graphene is comprehensively characterized using Raman spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and magnetotransport measurements, which reveal signatures of quantum Hall effect in synthesized graphene samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate van der Waals epitaxial growth of palladium (Pd) thin films on graphene transferred to Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates, establishing its single-crystalline nature over a large area and its potential as a versatile platform for subsequent heteroepitaxial growth.",

    "abstract": "We compare different methods for characterizing topology at nonzero temperatures, as applied to one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains and focusing on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states.",

    "abstract": "Heavy-fermion superconductors often display upper critical fields that exceed the conventional Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating that strong correlations and hybridized quasiparticle bands play an essential role in the paramagnetic pair-breaking process. Within the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model, we perform a self-consistent mean-field analysis of spin-singlet s-, extended-s-, and d-wave pairing under Zeeman fields, and compute the critical field Bc, the transition temperature Tc, and the Clogston-Chandrasekhar ratio rCC. We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter. These results provide microscopic evidence that proximity to a near-flat hybridized band offers a robust route to enhanced Pauli-limiting fields in heavy-fermion superconductors.",

Using large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a self-developed neural network potential,we show that Nb atoms predominantly occupy Ti sites and form short-range order with neighboring Al atoms, but a non-negligible fraction also occupies Al sites (NbAl) and promotes the formation of antisite defects (TiAl). Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity. Meanwhile, these substitutional and antisite defects also increase the Peierls stress of both screw and edge dislocations, which hinders dislocation motion to cause pronounced solid-solution strengthening. This work provides mechanistic insights into the dual role of Nb in enhancing both strength and ductility in {\\gamma}-TiAl and further offers guidance for defect and composition engineering in advanced alloy systems.",

In departing from the infinite-persistence limit and exploring the interplay of internal activity and external driving, we uncover when and why active and passive systems display similar avalanche statistics and where these analogies fail. We find that power-law distributed stress drops emerge only when activity builds long enough correlations, controlled by the persistence length, with exponents that vary from the purely strain-driven case, to the purely activity-driven case, in a smooth fashion. The local structure and scaling of avalanches of plastic rearrangements remains universal across both limit cases, supporting an interpretation of activity as increasing the typical size of the regions involved in a given avalanche. Our results bridge quasistatic shear strain and finite-persistence active yielding, showing that avalanches driven by self-propulsion retain the characteristic fingerprints of long-range stress propagation.",

    "abstract": "Recent variational studies have demonstrated that the strongly correlated ground states of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect can be captured using machine learning approaches starting from no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $\\nu = n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $\\nu = 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $\\nu = 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state.",

Although this motion with static potentials have been widely explored, its physics in time-dependent periodic potentials are far less well understood. Here we generalize this motion to the realm of time-dependent periodic potentials, showing that the asymptotic solution of the probability distribution function (PDF) can have a universal form, that is, a Boltzmann weight multiplied by a Gaussian envelope function. We derive a partial equation for this Boltzmann weight and demonstrate that many different potentials can give the same Boltzmann weight. We first present an exact solvable model to illustrate the validity of our solution. For the periodic potential with a time-dependent tilt potential, we can determine the Boltzmann weight by numerical solving the partial equation. These results are confirmed by solving the Langevin equation numerically. With this idea, we can determine the asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the entropy satisfies the thermodynamic law. Our results can have wide applications, including quasi-periodic potentials, two-dimensional potentials and even with models with inertia, which should greatly broaden our perspective of Brownian motion.",

This work presents a multiphysics finite element study on the thermomechanical dynamics of silicon wafers irradiated by picosecond laser pulses, focusing on the melting regime where thermomechanical and hydrodynamic effects dominate. To illustrate the sequential nature of laser scanning, single-pulse irradiation models are developed as thermomechanical analogues of double-pulse interactions. By positioning the laser focus near reflective boundaries and corners of the target, these models reproduce the stress-wave interference that would occur between successive pulses in scanning. The results show that periodic surface structures originate from mechanical standing wave interference within the molten layer, forming ripples with near-wavelength periodicity. The penetration depth (PD) is identified as a key factor controlling the duration and stability of these ripples: shallow PDs (75-150 nm) yield distinct, persistent patterns, while deeper PDs (app. 2.5 micrometers) lead to extended melting and hydrodynamic smoothing. Simulations of sequential double-pulse irradiation confirm that residual stresses and strains from the first pulse amplify deformation during the second, enhancing ripple amplitude and uniformity. Controlled excitation of mechanical standing waves governed by PD, boundary geometry, and pulse sequencing - thus represents a fundamental mechanism for deterministic LIPSS formation on silicon.",

We demonstrate a SHO that takes advantage of a low-damping magnetic garnet with dominant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), namely gallium-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (Ga:YIG). In-plane magnetized Ga:YIG allows for the operation at a high efficiency level while also enabling resonant spin-wave emission. A nonlinear self-localization of the excitation is avoided by exploiting the positive nonlinear frequency shift, which facilitates a current-controlled frequency of the emitted spin waves. Via micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we investigate the properties of the local auto-oscillation and its spin-wave emission. Multiple modes are excited and compete internally, with two propagating modes detected up to distances larger than \\SI{10}{\\micro\\meter}. Their frequencies combine to an extended frequency bandwidth of approximately \\SI{1.6}{\\giga\\hertz}. The experimentally observed two-mode system and its transition to a single mode at higher currents are reproduced via micromagnetic simulations, which account for spatial variation of the PMA arising due to the microstructures on Ga:YIG.

    "abstract": "Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.",

Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.",

    "title": "Electric Polarization from Nonpolar Phonons",
    "abstract": "Born effective charge (BEC), a fundamental quantity in lattice dynamics and ferroelectric theory, provides a quantitative measure of linear polarization response to ionic displacements. However, it does not account for higher-order effects, which can play a significant role in certain materials, such as fluorite HfO$_2$. In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that drives polarization in crystalline solids, offering new insights into the design principles of next-generation ferroelectric, piezoelectric and multifunctional materials.",

    "abstract": "Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a geometric scaling relation that characterizes the local scale behavior of correlations using the informational distance $d_E = K_0/\\sqrt{I}$, where $I$ is the mutual information. We define a geometric conversion factor, $G \\equiv \\partial_r d_E$, which quantifies the local scale. We show that $G$ relates directly to $I$ via $G \\propto I^{\\kappa}$. For systems with power-law correlations $I(r) \\sim r^{-X}$, the metric scaling exponent is $\\kappa = 1/X - 1/2$. A key consequence is that the geometric scale $G$ is uniform (position-independent) if and only if $\\kappa = 0$, which occurs precisely at $X = 2$. This identifies $X = 2$ as the unique condition for a uniform and metric informational distance. We validate this relation using DMRG simulations of the 1D XXZ chain and exact results for the XX model. We demonstrate two falsifiable diagnostics: (i) $G(r)$ is flat in the bulk at criticality ($X \\approx 2$) but varies strongly when gapped; (ii) a coordinate-agnostic slope test of $\\log G$ versus $\\log I$ at the XX benchmark ($X = 2$) yields $\\kappa \\simeq 0$. This approach provides a coordinate-independent method for identifying scaling regimes that helps to reduce ambiguity from non-universal amplitudes and from the fitting choices in standard power-law analyses, and defines a simple post-processing pipeline that can be applied directly to numerical or experimental mutual-information data.",

We find that an imbalance between crossed Andreev reflections and electron cotunneling in the middle Kitaev chain gives rise to an asymmetric $2\\pi$-periodic phase-dependent Andreev spectrum, controlled by the superconducting phases across the left and right junctions. We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect. Notably, these nonlocal Josephson supercurrents exhibit distinct positive and negative critical currents, demonstrating the realization of the nonlocal Josephson diode effect with highly tunable polarity and efficiencies exceeding $50\\%$. The nonlocal Josephson diode effect requires breaking local time-reversal and local charge-conjugation symmetries, with the latter being unique to minimal Kitaev chains. Our results establish minimal Kitaev chains as a highly controllable platform for engineering nonlocal Josephson phenomena.",

Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use.

This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method.

It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\\%$ compared to $0.80\\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.",

Our analysis reveals that the cluster vortex configuration reaches equilibrium more rapidly than the others, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations exhibit persistent non-equilibrium behavior, tending toward non-thermal fixed points. Specifically, the cluster configuration follows Kolmogorov-like scaling ($\\varepsilon^{i}(k)\\sim k^{-5/3}$) in the incompressible spectrum, while the other configurations follow Vinen-like scaling ($\\varepsilon^{i}(k)\\sim k^{-1}$). In the compressible spectrum, the cluster case exhibits a $k$ scaling, indicating full mode equilibration, while for the other configurations, the modes thermalize only above a critical wave number. Additionally, the transfer function for the cluster configuration displays a Gaussian distribution, typical of equilibrium states, while the other configurations exhibit skewed Gaussian or exponential distributions, indicative of their non-equilibrium nature. Finally, the particle number spectra show that the cluster case follows dynamical scaling closer to equilibrium, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations evolve towards non-thermal fixed points.

Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \\alpha < 2$.",

Several electric-field induced flat-band scenarios in the distorted sawtooth chain are analyzed, and expressions are derived for the electric-field strength required to drive the one-magnon excitations into a flat-band regime when the field is aligned along the lattice bonds. The saturation field and its dependence on the distortion angle are also examined. Finally, we establish a mapping between the flat-band solutions for a general DM interaction and its specific KNB-induced form. \\\\~ \\emph{This article is dedicated to the memory of Johannes Richter.}",

Its direct detection and control remains a challenge, requiring suitable material candidates. In this work, we present the emergence of a tunable quantum metric in a versatile two-dimensional material platform, namely, few-layer phosphorene. Using ab-initio-derived models, we show how electric fields can be used to substantially enhance the quantum metric as well as the associated quantum weight. Furthermore, we present a layer-dependent evolution of the quantum metric and its interplay with the electric field in this material. Our results establish few-layer phosphorene as a promising platform for exploring control over the quantum metric and the resulting metric responses in real materials.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has reshaped modern nanoscience, offering properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts. As experimental discovery accelerates, the need for reliable computational techniques has become increas- ingly important. Within the framework of density functional theory, this review explores the critical role of exchange-correlation functionals in predicting key material properties such as structural, optoelectronic, magnetic, and thermal. We examine the challenges posed by quantum confinement, anisotropic screening, and van der Waals interactions, which conventional functionals often fail to describe. Advanced approaches, including meta-GGA, hybrid functionals, and many-body perturbation theory (e.g., GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation), are assessed for their improved accuracy in capturing electronic structure and excitonic effects. We further discuss the non-universality of functionals across different 2D material families and the emerging role of machine learning to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the review outlines current limitations and emerging strategies, providing a roadmap for advancing exchange-correlation functionals and beyond, to enable the practical design and application of 2D materials.",

Starting from the true Hamiltonian $H$ of the system with $N$ degrees of freedom, we introduce a mean-field Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}$ such that the difference $h_N=(H-\\mathcal{H})/N$, considered as a random variable with respect to the Gibbs measure, tends to zero as $N\\to\\infty$, in probabilistic sense. The dynamics of the mean-field Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of $N$ independent oscillation modes with renormalized frequencies $\\Omega_k = \\omega_k\\sqrt{1+\\gamma(\\varepsilon)}$, $\\omega_k$ being the frequency of the $k$-th normal mode of the linearized system, whereas $\\gamma(\\varepsilon)$ is an explicit function of the specific energy $\\varepsilon$ of the system. Analytical predictions drawn from the effective Langevin equations ruling the dynamics of such oscillation modes are successfully compared with the numerical data from the original Hamiltonian dynamics. Such a simple decomposition of the true dynamics into $N$ effective normal modes holds at all energy scales, i.e. from the quasi-integrable regime to the strongly chaotic one.",

Understanding charge state conversion and equilibration is critical not only for NV centers in diamond but also for defects and impurities in wide-bandgap materials in general. The mechanisms by which these centers change charge state upon optical or electronic excitation without the presence of mobile carriers remain unclear, potentially affecting the performance of applications ranging from phosphors to power electronics. Here, we elucidate this issue for the case of photoionization of NV center ensembles. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, we ionize negatively charged NV centers and monitor the recovery of $\\NVm$ on timescales of up to several seconds. We find that the recovery rate depends strongly on the concentration of surrounding nitrogen donors. Remarkably, the equilibration dynamics exhibit no discernible dependence on temperature, ruling out thermally activated processes. The multiphonon-assisted electron tunneling model, supported by density-functional calculations, explains the measurements and identifies tunneling as the equilibration mechanism.",

Such a state in Cs$_{1-\\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O results from its G-type antiferromagnetism and two-dimensional electronic states, allowing for the development of spatially alternating altermagnetic layers, whose local spin polarizations are directly verified by spin-resolved ARPES measurements. Our experimental discovery of hidden altermagnetism broadens the scope of unconventional magnetism and opens routes to exploring emergent phenomena from real-space modulations of altermagnetic order.",

    "abstract": "Owing to their exceptional chemical and electronic tunability, metal-organic frameworks can be designed to develop magnetic ground states making a range of applications feasible, from magnetic gas separation to the implementation of lightweight, rare-earth free permanent magnets. However, the typically weak exchange interactions mediated by the diamagnetic organic ligands result in ordering temperatures confined to the cryogenic limit. The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites. These results demonstrate that high-temperature magnetic metal-organic frameworks can serve as a versatile platform for exploring correlated electron phenomena in low-density, chemically tunable materials.",

    "abstract": "Lead-free vacancy-ordered perovskites (VOHPs) such as Cs2SnCl6 have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications but typically suffer from wide band gaps and low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). In this work, the electronic origins of broadband blue emission in Bi3+-doped Cs2SnCl6 are elucidated by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The study systematically explores the spatial configurations of Bi3+ dopants and Cl- vacancies, assessing their impact on structural and electronic properties. Results demonstrate that the formation of square pyramidal BiCl5(2-) units serves as efficient exciton traps, fundamentally enabling strong luminescence in an otherwise non-emitting host. The Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair in an asymmetric coordination environment drives second-order Jahn-Teller distortions, creating a highly polarizable local lattice. This softness, in contrast to the rigid SnCl6(2-) framework, produces heterogeneous distributions of bond lengths, bond angles, and band edges around dopant sites. Defect-induced states strongly localize charge carriers, while coupling to vibrational modes at 300 K dynamically broadens the band edges, accounting for the large Stokes shift and broadband photoluminescence. These results establish lone-pair-driven Jahn-Teller distortions and lattice heterogeneity as key design principles for efficient luminescence in lead-free perovskites.",

Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.",

    "abstract": "Living organisms can demonstrate highly adaptable and sophisticated responses using memory resulting from repeated exposure to external conditions or training. However, realizing similar adaptability in mechanical responses in inanimate, physical materials presents an outstanding challenge in several fields, including soft matter, materials science, and in the domain of soft robotics, to name a few. Our study focuses on disordered solids, which are model systems that resemble granular matter, foam and other disordered, soft solids. Here, combining bulk rheology, in-situ optical imaging, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how training via cyclic shear can encode memories that tune the yield point in a unique way and over unprecedented ranges. Our study reveals that such tunability is intricately linked to the plasticity, non-affine deformations, and formation of shear bands. Remarkably, our numerical simulations illustrate that systems with identical internal energies, prepared via different protocols (mechanical or thermal), can display markedly different rheological responses, indicating that energy alone does not determine mechanical behavior. Moreover, while the yield strain increases with training amplitude, the material simultaneously softens, contrasting with the thermal case where both quantities increase monotonically with increasing annealing. Our results open up possibilities for memory-induced tuning of mechanical response in trainable amorphous matter, independently or in combination with thermal annealing, far beyond the material--feature space achievable via the latter alone.",

    "abstract": "Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed \"AI/ML\". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community.

    "abstract": "The role of additives such as FEC in extending the calendar life of silicon anodes beyond the cycling benefits is still not fully understood. Herein, the calendar life of high-loading Si (80 wt%) using baseline 1.2 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC electrolyte versus adding 10 wt% FEC is investigated over months. Over 8 days of aging, FEC leads to a 13-fold reduction in irreversible capacity loss in Si-LiFePO4 full cells. Cells without FEC are projected to fall below 80% of their initial capacity within approx. 22 days versus approx. 279 days with FEC. Symmetric Si-Si cells from harvested electrodes show greater increase in interphase resistance without FEC, whereby an increase of 10.81 Ohms is measured for 0 wt% FEC vs. only 3.37 Ohms for 10 wt% FEC over 2 months. Power law modeling of this long-term interphase resistance finds mixed transport-reaction growth behavior in FEC-free cells, suggesting significant dissolution, whereas cells with 10 wt% FEC added display a diffusion-controlled impedance growth behavior, suggesting a robust surface passivation film. Post-mortem FTIR and XPS confirm polycarbonate enrichment of the SEI, which was discovered to predominantly emerge from FEC self-polymerization during the idle aging. When the Si electrodes aged with and without FEC are harvested and reassembled into full cells with the same electrolytes used at aging, the first-cycle coulombic efficiency is 71% for 0 wt% FEC versus 97% for 10 wt% FEC. Subsequent cycling maintains over 99.7% CE with 10 wt% FEC, surpassing the pre-aging CE of 98.8%. This elevated CE indicates better passivation provided by the polymer fragments formed during aging compared to electrochemically formed SEI where no strong polymer FTIR signal is found. The self-polymerization during idle aging with additives such as FEC is therefore an opportune in situ mechanism to further engineer in extending the life of Si-based batteries.",

Here, we present a theoretical description of the instantaneous translational diffusion coefficients of transmembrane protein aggregates on free and supported lipid membranes using Kirkwood-Riseman theory. We find that hydrodynamic interactions within protein aggregates must be accounted for, as neglecting them yields several times lower diffusion coefficients. By deriving hydrodynamic radii for free and supported lipid membranes, we identify effective length scales that accurately characterize aggregate diffusivities in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. These findings motivate the approximation of an aggregate by its outline and a random particle distribution inside it. We show that this approach provides a practical method to accurately determine aggregate diffusion coefficients when the particle locations cannot be resolved. The results presented in this article have immediate implications for the formation and function of membrane protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "The frequency structure of the superconducting correlations in cuprates gives insights on the pairing mechanism. Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism.",

    "abstract": "High temperature superconductors, especially YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO), are considered a key enabling technology towards a clean energy future. Hole doping in YBCO is a prerequisite for the emergence of its unchallenged superconducting properties. Up to now, research was focused on the under- and optimally doped region, due to practical limitations in reaching the overdoped state, despite being highly interesting from fundamental and applied aspects as competing orders vanish and critical current densities are expected to peak. Here, we deploy for the first time an electrochemical method to access the mostly uncharted overdoped region. We demonstrate precise control over the bulk oxygen concentration in YBCO thin films across the full off-stoichiometry window (0$\\le{\\delta}\\le$1) using electrochemical oxidation combined with in situ XRD and electrical measurements. Resulting high doping states and critical current densities are confirmed using a multi modal approach, including x-ray diffraction, electrical, Hall and magnetic characterization. Thus, this work opens a promising pathway based on electrochemical oxidation towards electronically clean, oxygen overdoped cuprate superconductors and therefore will assist to further push the critical current density to its intrinsic limit.",

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors.",

However, their microscopic mechanisms remain elusive, often relying on abstract group theory. In this work, we present an intuitive and pedagogical framework to understand the origin of spin splitting in altermagnets. We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2. By demystifying the microscopic origins of altermagnetism, our work bridges symmetry analysis and material realizations, shedding light on practical designs of altermagnetic spintronic devices.",

The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations.

A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy.

Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.",

In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices.",

We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates.",

Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.",

It is well known that the combination of broken time-reversal symmetry and broken inversion symmetry can generate non-reciprocal phenomena, but the interplay between these kinds of systems and superconductivity is not well known. We present Josephson junctions fabricated from Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ that give magnetic diffraction patterns with asymmetry in both the magnetic field and the critical current. The non-reciprocity in positive critical current and negative critical current, generally called the Josephson diode effect, has an efficiency of up to $\\eta=20\\%$ in some parts of the magnetic diffraction pattern and persists even at zero applied field. We propose that pinned Abrikosov vortices are a main mechanism for the asymmetric magnetic field response in this system, and that the non-zero spin chirality of the Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ causes the diode effect. Simulations of magnetic diffraction patterns from Josephson junctions with vortices present show offsets from zero-field consistent with observations, while simulations of chiral spin structures with an out-of-plane canting show a diode effect.",

    "abstract": "It is long established that overdoped cuprate superconductors experience a loss of superfluid density (SFD) with increasing doping, p, along with the decline in T_c. Such behavior is unconventional and suggests a depletion of the condensate by increasing pairbreaking or the growth of a second non-pairing channel. This led to a recent suggestion that the condensate arises from an incoherent charge channel which progressively gives way with overdoping to a second, coherent non-pairing channel. Contra these ideas, we report analysis of the field-dependent electronic specific heat of several cuprates from which we find no apparent loss of SFD with overdoping. The SFD per CuO_2 plaquette is found to rise progressively with overdoping from p towards (1+p), undiminished and much the same as the Hall number, thus implying that all available carriers contribute to the condensate. We suggest this could be the underlying intrinsic behavior for all cuprates. Our samples include (Y,Ca)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}, Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\\delta}, La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and Tl_2Ba_2CuO_6, with the latter being the only exception.

    "abstract": "The pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprate superconductors harbours diverse manifestations of different ordered electronic-states, and then these ordered electronic-states coexist or compete with superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic electron propagator, the nature of the ordered electronic-states in the pseudogap phase is investigated within the $T$-matrix approach. This $T$-matrix is derived in terms of the inverse of matrix for various kinds of a single impurity, and then is used to evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) by the involvement of all the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes. It is shown that a number of the anomalous properties in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is directly correlated to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap: (i) the structure of the microscopic octet scattering model generated by the normal-state pseudogap is essentially the same both in the superconducting (SC)-state and pseudogap phase, which naturally leads to that the quasiparticle scattering interference octet phenomenology observed in the SC-state exists in the pseudogap phase; (ii) however, the spectral weight at around the antinodal region in the SC-state is gapped out completely by both the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, while it in the pseudogap phase is suppressed partially by the normal-state pseudogap, this directly leads to that the non-dispersive checkerboard charge ordering with a finite wave vector ${\\bf Q}$ appears in the pseudogap phase only. The theory therefore also shows that the electronic-states affected by the normal-state pseudogap exhibit the LDOS modulation spectrum organization.",

    "title": "Role of impurity statistics and medium constraints in polaron-polaron interactions",
    "abstract": "We consider the behavior of a small density of mobile impurities (polarons) immersed in a quantum gas, a generic scenario that can be realized in cold atomic gases, liquid helium mixtures and doped semiconductors. We present a unified theoretical framework for understanding polaron quasiparticles beyond the single-impurity limit, and we identify two key factors that control the polaron-polaron interactions: (i) the statistics of the impurities, including whether or not they are degenerate, and (ii) the constraints on the medium response, i.e., whether the medium density or chemical potential is held fixed. By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.",

A set of nanoparticle models has been constructed, with varying Cu and Au ratios. MD method is carried out to calculate the melting temperature, heat capacity, radial distribution function (RDF), Lindemann index, mean square displacement (MSD), and diffusion coefficients of these models. The findings demonstrate that nanoparticles rich in Cu exhibit a higher melting temperature and more defined phase transitions. In contrast, structures rich in gold exhibited reduced melting temperatures and showed surface-initiated melting behaviours. MD study highlights that the thermal stability and atomic mobility of Cu-Au Janus nanoparticles depend on the composition ratio and the dispersion of materials.",

The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.",

Here we demonstrate significant improvements in absorber quality by alloying with Ag to form (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 (ACIGS) absorbers. We report the Ag alloying effect on compositional, structural, and optoelectronic properties of absorbers. We demonstrate suppressed bulk recombination and improved carrier lifetime in ACIGS, as a result of improved grain size, porosity reduction and defect passivation. We also show that Ag alloying flattens the Ga gradient. Consideration of this impact of Ag will be necessary in future engineering of the Ga profile to maximize charge carrier collection and avoid interface recombination. Exploiting the beneficial effects of Ag alloying, we report a wide bandgap (1.58 eV) ACIGS solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency of 15.5% and a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 948 mV, improving on the reference pure CIGS solar cell, with an 11.2% efficiency and an 821 mV VOC. Ag alloying is a useful route to further increase the efficiency of CIGS solar cells and future tandem devices.",

Here, we investigate, for the case of homogeneous ice nucleation, whether the nucleus size exhibits Markovian dynamics, as assumed in classical nucleation theory. Using 300 independent nucleation trajectories generated by molecular dynamics, we evaluate the mean recurrence time required to reach selected values of the largest nucleus size. Early recurrences consistently take longer than later ones, revealing a clear history dependence and thus non-Markovian dynamics. To identify the slow modes underlying this behaviour, we analyse several structural descriptors of the nucleus, observing subtle but systematic differences between nuclei at early and late recurrences. By training a neural network on 2,700 short trajectories to learn the committor, we identify relevant collective variables. Based on these features, symbolic regression provides a compact approximation of the committor, i.e., an improved reaction coordinate, which we subsequently test for Markovianity.",

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(\\beta_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.",

In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $\\sigma$- and $\\pi$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $\\sigma$-orbital virtually hops to the $\\pi$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $\\sigma$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $\\sigma$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit.",

Their magnetic moment and nanoscale dimensions have long enabled applications in magnetic resonance imaging, targeted drug delivery, separation technologies, and hyperthermia. Beyond these well-established uses, a growing research direction has emerged at the interface of physics and biology: the application of MNPs in mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces regulate cellular and tissue functions. This review examines how Massart MNPs can be used to generate, transmit, and measure forces within living systems. Particular attention is given to interfacial control through advanced surface chemistries, which ensure colloidal stability, minimize toxicity, and preserve the nanoscale integrity of the particles. We also show that the robustness and scalability of Massart synthesis make it ideally suited to the production of biocompatible nanomaterials in quantities required for comprehensive biological studies. Two complementary approaches are discussed. The first exploits MNP assemblies that arise spontaneously within cells, in the form of endosomes. These compartments enable the application of controlled magnetic forces to study both the formation of reconstructed tissues and organoids, and their viscoelastic response. The second focuses on micrometric magnetic wires fabricated from MNPs, used in active microrheology to probe the cytoplasm of living cells over a wide frequency range. Together, these approaches illustrate how MNP assemblies can accurately quantify cellular and tissue mechanics, providing new opportunities for mechanobiological studies and enabling the development of novel readouts of cellular mechanics with potential diagnostic applications.",

This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is localized around the wire, and display characteristic dumbbellshaped profiles. For wires representative of MRS experiments in cells, the product of shear rate and cytoplasmic relaxation time (''$ with $ ~ 1 s) remains below unity, indicating that the flow occurs within the linear regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the zeroshear viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. This study also demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties.",

Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies.",

Typically, their properties have been determined merely by analogy to the rather trivial one-dimensional case, leaving a gap between experimentally accessible observables and suitable theoretical models. Within a harmonic approximation, we characterise analytically a two-dimensional triangular lattice of active particles that interact with their nearest neighbours through a general pair potential, obtaining exact expressions for the correlators. We study this \"active crystal\" as a means of characterising active matter in the dense phase. Our treatment correctly approximates arbitrary pair potentials, rather than demanding an unphysical non-singular bilinear form. We retain \"off-diagonal\" terms that are routinely neglected despite quantifying the anisotropy of the particles' local potential. From the exact expressions for the correlation matrices, we derive exact results that shed light on the presence (or absence) of crystalline order. We further calculate the mean-squared particle separation, energy, entropy production rate and the onset of a pressure-induced instability resulting in the breakdown of the harmonic approximation. The entropy production rate is found to have a general form that is valid for generic active particles and lattice geometries, while resembling that of non-interacting \"active modes\".",

Different dopant concentrations were confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy images revealed a grain-like surface structure of the samples with grain size increasing after rapid thermal processing (RTP). Raman spectroscopy showed that introducing Eu changes vibrational properties of CdO through intraionic anharmonicity reduction. Kelvin probe method revealed upward band bending caused by oxygen adsorption during RTP. Electrical measurements confirmed that rectifying junctions were manufactured and that they are able to produce photocurrent in the spectral range of 450-1150 nm without external voltage bias. Introducing Eu into CdO was found to increase e.g. rectifying factor and responsivity.

    "abstract": "High$-$quality Josephson junctions made of twisted cuprate superconductors offer unprecedented opportunities in addressing fundamental problems and realizing next$-$generation superconducting devices at relatively high temperatures. Whether or not the twisted cuprates possess high$-$temperature topological superconductivity remains an outstanding issue. Here, we tackle this problem via an in$-$depth study of the key predicted feature $--$ half$-$integer Shapiro steps. We show that half$-$integer Shapiro steps do occur in samples at a twist angle of 45$^\\circ$ but are unstable with thermal cycling. Interestingly, fractional steps can be introduced by training the sample with a small magnetic field or annealing with a large electrical current, attesting to a tunable current$-$phase relation (CPR) in twisted cuprates. We extend the current annealing to realize fractional steps with odd denominators too. Furthermore, half$-$integer steps can be induced in the regime that is well beyond the expectation of topological superconductivity, favoring an alternative mechanism involving trapped vortices. Our results not only caution the direct association of half$-$integer Shapiro steps with the exotic mechanism but also open a distinct pathway toward a Josephson junction with electrically tunable CPR at high temperatures.",

    "title": "Electric polarization driven by non-collinear spin alignment investigated by first principles calculations",
    "abstract": "We present an approach for first principles investigations on the spin driven electric polarization in type II multiferroics. We propose a parametrization of the polarization with the parameters calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) formalism. Within this approach the induced electric polarization of a unit cell is represented in terms of three-site parameters. Those antisymmetric with respect to spin permutation are seen as an ab-initio based counter-part to the phenomenological parameters used within the inverse-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction (DMI) model. Due to their relativistic origin, these parameters are responsible for the electric polarization induced in the presence of a non-collinear spin alignment in materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Beyond to this, our approach gives direct access to the element- or site-resolved electric polarization. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, we consider several examples of the so-called type II multiferroics, for which the magneto-electric effect is observed either as a consequence of an applied magnetic field (we use Cr$_2$O$_3$ as a prototype), or as a result of a phase transition to a spin-spiral magnetic state, as for instance in MnI$_2$, CuCrO$_2$ and AgCrO$_2$.",

    "abstract": "The effective mass of charge carriers is a fundamental descriptor of the electronic structure of materials, and can be used to assess performance in electronics applications, or to screen for thermoelectrics and transparent conductors. Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces.",

    "abstract": "As the emerging ferroelectric (FE) materials, the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics without phase-matching bottleneck, usually exhibit the pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \\c{hi}xxx and \\c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new \"slidetronics\" applications.",

Focussing on Markov jump processes, we show how a non-zero Berry curvature leads to a breakdown of the thermodynamic Maxwell relations and of the Clausius heat theorem. We also present a variant of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in which the parameters follow a curve with vanishing Berry curvature, but the system still experiences a nonzero Berry phase. Finally, we identify (sufficient) no-localization conditions in terms of mean first-passage times under which the corresponding Berry potentials and curvatures vanish at absolute zero, extending, for arbitrary driving, e.g. the case of vanishing heat capacity as for the Nernst postulate.",

    "abstract": "Microstructural evolution in metallic materials feedbacks with the loading conditions and influences the life time of parts and components. Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load.",

The analytical formalism is then used to study how quantum correlations gradually develop, with increasing $T$, from those determined by the initial state towards their steady-state form. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for several types of initial states. We further consider the long-time limit, when the system in $d+1$ space-time dimensions becomes quasi-one-dimensional, and analyze the scaling of the ``localization'' time (which is simultaneously the purification time and the charge-sharpening time for this class of problems). The analytical predictions for scaling properties are fully confirmed by numerical simulations in a $d=2$ model around the measurement-induced phase transition.

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.",

We report on the fabrication and electrical properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN junctions produced by reactive sputtering in Ar+N2 mixture on 200-mm wafers at 200 oC and incorporated into a planarized process with two Nb ground planes and Nb wiring layer. Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes. IcRn products up to ~ 0.5 mV were obtained for JJs with Jc~ 0.6 mA/um^2. Jc(T) dependences have been measured.",

We present an extended Wang-Landau sampling approach to efficiently compute the density of states of charged mixtures with respect to the particle number. The method supports simulations in both bulk and confined geometries. Combined with the Constant Potential Method, it also enables to study effects due to confining electrodes. We employ this approach to study symmetric, binary mixtures of charged Lennard-Jones particles -- the modified Restricted Primitive Model -- in bulk, in inert confinement, and in conductive confinement at the potential of zero charge. Our results show that confinement shifts the vapor-liquid critical point to lower temperatures and higher densities compared to bulk, in line with the classical concept of capillary condensation. Importantly, conductive boundaries significantly lower the chemical potential of coexistence relative to inert confinement. These findings offer deeper insight into the phase behavior of ionic fluids in energy-relevant porous environments.",

Despite its potential, the band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N remain largely unexplored, although this information is essential for device design. In this study, we compute the valence and conduction band alignments of nonpolar ($a$-plane) and polar ($c$-plane) B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, and compare them with those of AlN and GaN. Using density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, $GW_0$ method, and a novel passivation scheme, we find that they have near-zero valence band alignments for low-$x$ B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN, while higher compositions ($x > $0.333) exhibit type I or II band alignments. The band alignments also show a notable dependence on surface polarity and the tetrahedral distortion of the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures. Our computed offsets are in good agreement with available experimental data. Due to their low valence band alignments and higher conduction band alignments, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN heterostructures could be well suited for high-electron-mobility transistors and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes.

Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.",

    "abstract": "Complex concentrated alloys with intrinsic chemical heterogeneity are promising candidates for nuclear applications, where local chemical order can strongly influence defect evolution under irradiation. Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems.",

The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system.

In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics.",

Using a particle-based model that resolves nutrient fields as well as cellular orientations and their inheritance, we investigate how orientational order emerges within expanding fronts whose morphology is set by nutrient limitation. We identify a transition in nematic order controlled by front morphology, with orientational memory influencing alignment only on one side of this transition. Under strong inheritance, orientational order varies non-monotonically: both thin active layers (fingering morphologies) and thick active layers (flat fronts) produce strong alignment, whereas intermediate cases are less ordered. Analysis of velocities, reorientation statistics, and stress anisotropies shows that this behavior reflects a shift from inheritance-dominated to mechanically driven alignment that overrides lineage memory. The resulting differences in front speed produce a fitness advantage of orientational memory only in the diffusion-limited, memory-dominated regime. These findings elucidate how nutrient supply, mechanical interactions, and single-cell expansion together shape self-organization during growth.",

Specifically, we calculate explicitly a one-parameter family of nonequilibrium drop shapes that depend on the scaled drop size. These shapes are close to the equilibrium Wulff shape, but the smaller drops are more spherical and the larger drops have an enhanced anisotropy in comparison to the Wulff shape. We also demonstrate that the the drop size distribution is modified from the isotropic LS distribution at second order in the anisotropy strength.",

    "abstract": "Cellular renewing active matter - assemblies of proliferating and apoptotic cells - underlies tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, and clonal competition. Previous work in one-dimensional periodic systems identified a fitness advantage associated with rapid dead-cell clearance, an \"opportunistic\" competition mechanism. Extending this framework, we study two-dimensional cellular aggregates and show that dimensionality modifies the interplay between competition mechanisms for clones with different clearance rates: in 2D, opportunistic and homeostatic-pressure-based competition jointly shape clonal selection, to varying degrees. We then introduce an explicit circular confinement to probe how boundaries modulate this interplay. While opportunistic competition persists, distinct timescale-dependent behaviors emerge through weakened homeostatic-pressure-based competition near boundaries. Structural analysis reveals that confinement promotes tangential alignment and spatially heterogeneous homeostatic pressure, thereby reshaping competitive outcomes at tissue edges. Our study connects newly discovered competition mechanisms with more realistic biological contexts, highlighting how dimensionality and spatial constraints influence tissue structures and modulate competition in heterogeneous cell populations, with implications for tumor growth dynamics and tissue development.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.",

As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions.

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.",

    "abstract": "Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.",

We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT.

Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 {\\mu}W with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.",

These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.",

The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\\partial S_{q,s}/\\partial U=1/\\vert T\\vert^{q}_{\\pm}$, which recovers $\\partial S_{BG}/\\partial U=1/T$ \\cite{Clausius1865} as $q\\rightarrow1$.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.",

This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.",

Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.",

We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution.",

When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies.",

    "abstract": "Indium-tin oxide (ITO) has been leveraged as a crucial functional layer in the optoelectronic frameworks, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 °C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice.",

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

A low-temperature expansion then yields leading-order ($T/\\mu^*$) expressions for the shear ($\\eta$) and bulk ($\\zeta$) viscosities, where the behavior $\\zeta/\\eta \\propto (T/\\mu^*)^4$ in the degenerate regime is found to be robust against quasiparticle mass correction. We couple the kinetic framework to a Walecka-type mean-field equation of state and compute $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ for cold, dense nucleon matter. The transport properties of nucleonic matter in the degenerate regime can be relevant for intermediate beam-energy nuclear experiments.",

Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments.

The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations. These findings may facilitate deeper understanding of soliton/breather interactions beyond conventional multi-soliton systems and bound-state complexes in SOC BEC.",

These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science.",

We demonstrate the formation of transient surface displacement patterns under femtosecond laser irradiation at fluences well below this threshold. Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations. We suggest that our experiment revealed a universal phenomenon that will be observed on any strongly absorbing material under ultrafast laser irradiation.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.",

In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings.

To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.

    "abstract": "We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.",

While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\\rho N$ dimensions can separate $\\alpha N$ random patterns if and only if $\\alpha < 2\\rho$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings.",

It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations.

Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of a resonant valence bond phase in the Hubbard model that originally motivated the concept, a definitive realisation has yet to be achieved. Here we present a solution to this long-standing problem by uncovering a resonant valence bond phase exhibiting spin-charge separation in realistic Hamiltonians. We show analytically that this ground state emerges in the dilute-doping limit of a half-filled Mott insulator on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping, in the absence of exchange interactions. We confirm numerically that the results extend to finite exchange interactions, finite-sized systems and finite dopant density. Although much attention has been devoted to the emergence of unconventional states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be essential for stabilising robust, topologically ordered states in real materials.",

    "title": "Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign",
    "abstract": "Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.",

    "abstract": "The exotic quantum states emerging in the quasicrystal (QC) have attracted extensive interest because of various properties absent in the crystal. In this paper, we systematically study the Holstein model at half filling on a prototypical structure of QC, namely rhombic Penrose lattice, aiming at investigating the superconductivity (SC) and other intertwined ordering arising from the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electron-phonon ({\\it e}-ph) interaction. Through unbiased sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal the salient features of the ground-state phase diagram. Distinct from the results on bipartite periodic lattices at half filling, SC is dominant in a large parameter regime on the Penrose lattice. When {\\it e}-ph coupling is sufficiently strong, charge-density-wave order appears and strongly suppresses the SC. The strongest SC emerges at intermediate {\\it e}-ph coupling strength and pronounced pairing fluctuation exists above the SC transition temperature. The strong pairing originates from the cooperative effects of unique lattice structure and macroscopically degenerate confined states at Fermi energy which uniquely exist on the Penrose lattice. Moreover, we demonstrate the forbidden ladders substantially suppress the phase coherence of SC. Our unbiased numerical results suggest that Penrose lattice is a potential platform to realize strong SC pairing, providing a promising avenue to searching for relatively high-$T_c$ SC dominantly induced by {\\it e}-ph coupling.",

    "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel class of quantum materials with significant potential in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics, and opto-valleytronics. TMDs exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling, enabling efficient spin-charge interconversion, which makes them ideal candidates for spin-orbit torque-driven spintronic devices. In this study, we investigated the spin-to-charge conversion through ferromagnetic resonance in MoS$_2$/Cu/CoFeB heterostructures with varying Cu spacer thicknesses. The conversion efficiency, quantified by the spin Hall angle, was enhanced by an order of magnitude due to Cu intercalation. Magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy confirmed that Cu did not significantly modify the magnetic domains, indicating its effectiveness in decoupling MoS$_2$ from CoFeB. This decoupling preserves the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS$_2$ by mitigating the exchange interaction with CoFeB, as proximity to localized magnetization can alter the electronic structure and SOC. First-principles calculations revealed that Cu intercalation notably enhances the spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity, contributing to the increased spin Hall angle. This study demonstrates that interface engineering of ferromagnet/TMD-based heterostructures can achieve higher spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies, paving the way for advancements in spintronic applications.",

In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. The role of vortices in such a strongly forced state is marginal, which makes this new state very different from the strongly turbulent state composed of a tangle of quantized vortex lines. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\\phi=\\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.",

The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.",

The same level of accuracy is preserved upon inclusion of nuclear quantum effects, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In addition, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave functions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected quantum crystal, and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution with disparate mass scales.

    "abstract": "A second-principles effective interatomic potential is introduced for the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \\ (a^-a^-c^+) \\rightarrow C2/m \\ (a^-b^-c^0) \\rightarrow I4/mcm \\ (a^-c^0c^0) \\rightarrow Pm\\bar{3}m \\ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at 0 K. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric.",

Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\\nu$ and $\\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via \"tangential\" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\\nu - 1/\\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.",

Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands.

However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\\nu>1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description.

    "abstract": "Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.",

Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.",

Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.",

We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.",

Two types of initial conditions were considered, one with an imposed single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. Under the single-mode perturbation, the growth rate deviated from the theoretical prediction for small cylinder radii, but progressively approached and agreed with classical macroscopic theory as the radius increased. In contrast, for the unperturbed initial condition, we found a systematic relationship between the breakup time and the minimum radius, in which the power-law exponent increased with increasing radius. These results demonstrate that, even in extremely microscopic systems with cylinder radii on the order of only about fifteen atomic diameters, the growth of the instability can follow macroscopic theoretical predictions when appropriate conditions are imposed, and that the influence of thermal fluctuations on the breakup dynamics becomes increasingly significant as the system radius decreases.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnets, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T << T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0<T<T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.",

Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in Rydberg atom chains of experimentally realistic scale, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.",

This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra.

In this work, we establish a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for feedback cooling in classical underdamped Langevin systems, thereby deriving a trade-off between the cooling efficiency and the entropy reduction rate. The obtained TUR implies that simultaneous achievement of the ideal cooling efficiency and finite entropy reduction rate is asymptotically possible by letting the fluctuation of the reversible local mean velocity diverge. This is shown to be feasible by using a feedback control based on the Kalman filter. Our results clarify the thermodynamic costs of achieving the fundamental cooling limit of feedback control from the perspective of the TUR.",

We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law.

While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous Hall effect (AHE)-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. We present an analytical formula for the skyrmion AHE readout signal, demonstrating scalability from micrometer to nanometer skyrmions.

The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.",

Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors.

    "title": "Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration",
    "abstract": "Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.",

    "abstract": "Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.",

When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic Néel order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\\rm N}$.

    "abstract": "We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the \"missing heat flux\" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.",

For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal'' (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.",

One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.",

The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\\lambda^{-2}$, where $\\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.",

For devices, n-type concentrations above 10^19 cm^-3 are required. Ge is a promising alternative n-type dopant with an ionic radius similar to Ga. Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge \"clustering peak\" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to >200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering. Ultimately, we believe Ge clustering limits activation of implanted Ge at high concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.",

Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane.

In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded\" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \\emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.",

While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.",

    "title": "Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements",
    "abstract": "The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.",

    "abstract": "Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and size distribution dominated by smaller events. However, the physical origin of these slow earthquake statistics remains controversial. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. To model slow-earthquake fault materials under hydrothermal conditions, we use a low-friction soft hydrogel particle layer floating on lubricating fluid and conduct stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as with slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with sparse contact structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may be driven by pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.",

We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \\sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.",

The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel.

In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.",

Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.",

We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits.

After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves, and also boundary-induced wave interference arising from divergent and convergent reflected wave trajectories with varying growth rates. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.",

Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.",

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.",

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.",

Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry.

Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii.

We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction force for nonspinning eccentric orbits within the effective-one-body (EOB) description for the massless scalar-tensor theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The effects in such theories start at $1/c^3$ and interestingly, the 1.5PN order effect is due to the radiation reaction square effects which is a conservative effect. The results derived here can be implemented in the quasi-circular EOB-based waveform models to construct waveform templates for generic orbit binaries within massless scalar-tensor theories of gravity.",

In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.",

To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.",

The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.",

Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT.

We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.",

This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin.",

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $\\eta$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $\\eta$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.",

Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins.

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.",

The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously.",

Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the theoretical implications of quantum gravity by analyzing compact stellar objects, presenting three distinct models that serve as alternatives to traditional black holes. These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties.",

While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude.

For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible.

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.",

The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \\kappa/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times.

Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory.

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.",

The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces.

We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry.

The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere.",

Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.",

    "abstract": "Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.",

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram.

Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars.

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $\\kappa$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.",

Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics.

The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk",

Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed.

Then, we study the optical appearances of an optically and geometrically thin spherical accretion around the regular black hole in this framework.

We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant.

Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel approach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing a divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum gravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in spacetime foliations, enabling a Schrodinger-like evolution that preserves diffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary evolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the foliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive process emerging from quantum fluctuations, where correlations between matter and geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This provides a potential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining background independence in canonical quantum gravity.",

We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below for the case of fixed spatial vector magnitude. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum.

As a representative parity-violating theory, dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity has attracted significant attention in recent gravitational wave (GW) studies. Numerous works have constrained the dCS theory through GW observations using quasi-circular waveform templates. Since GW parameter estimation depends critically on waveform template accuracy, improved source modeling and waveform construction are essential for tighter constraints on parity-violating gravity. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational radiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin precession. By extending the quasi-Keplerian parameterization, we solve the equations of motion including leading-order dCS corrections and precession effects. Furthermore, the conservative sectors of the gravitational and scalar radiation are presented, the corresponding energy and angular momentum loss are calculated, and the orbital decay is also investigated. Notably, because of the non-zero monopole scalar radiation, carrying energy but not angular momentum, the zero-eccentricity orbit is no longer the final stable state of binaries under radiation reaction. This work provides the theoretical foundation for the complete waveform construction in dCS gravity, benefiting the future gravitational parity-symmetry tests.",

The algebra is closed under multiplication and second-order differentiation, with all non-linear operations defined on smooth representatives before taking the limit. Applied to the non-linear scalar-field wave equation for the shift vector, the wave operator converges to a linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative, encoding a sharply localised curvature impulse that displaces the vacuum; in the correspondence limit, the equation reduces to the massless Klein-Gordon equation. Classical singularities are replaced by a well-defined distributional structure: the scalar Ricci projection is non-negative on the singular support and converges to a positive linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative while away from the support, in the emerging classical spacetime, the strong energy condition is violated on open sets. The trace of the extrinsic curvature, the mean curvature, and the null expansions vanish on the support (no trapped surfaces). For finite values of the sequence index, there exist open neighbourhoods in which both the inward and outward null expansions are strictly negative; thus, locally and in a classical context, trapped surfaces can occur in those regions. The level sets of the global time function, together with their normal, become asymptotically null, yielding a limiting unstable characteristic hypersurface that fixes evolution by null data and forbids any extension into chronology-violating regions. Finally, it is argued that, within this framework, a gravity-induced spontaneous state reduction restores the Equivalence Principle in the emerging classical spacetimes.",

    "abstract": "We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature horizons that affect geometry when n>=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole evaporation and stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Black hole (BH) perturbation theory and the scattering models provide a powerful framework for studying gravitational lensing at the wave-optics level. However, conventional calculations encountered two issues: the divergence of the partial-wave series and the divergence of the Poisson spot near the optical axis. These issues hinder the accurate calculation of lensed waveforms and the study of polarization and wave characteristics in the lensing process, especially near the optical axis. This work demonstrates that both divergences stem from the asymptotic expansion of the radial wave function. By computing the scattered wave function at finite radii and avoiding the asymptotic expansion, we naturally obtain convergent results. We compute scalar waves scattered by (1) a weak-gravity body with Newtonian potential and (2) a Schwarzschild BH with Regge-Wheeler potential. In both cases, we analyze the convergence of the partial-wave series and present finite-luminosity diffraction patterns, with a bright Poisson spot. The above calculations are compared with the Kirchhoff diffraction integral in the near-axis regions and give consistent results. Our investigations provide a foundation for studying gravitational wave scattering by BHs and understanding lensing at the wave-optics level.",

The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs.

This \"spacetime geodesy\" point of view is particularly useful in those situations where, for one reason or another, the dynamical equations of motion are either uncertain or completely unknown. Several specific examples are discussed -- we shall illustrate what can be done by considering the physics implications of demanding spatially isotropic Ricci tensors as a way of automatically implementing the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, without committing to a specific equation of state. We also consider the structure of the Weyl tensor in spherical symmetry, with and without the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, and relate this to the notion of \"complexity\".

Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis.

The field space metric $g^S_{\\chi\\chi} = (1 + e^{-2\\alpha\\phi/M_{\\mathrm{Pl}}})^{-1}$ is rigorously derived from fundamental physical principles: (i) exponential suppression during contraction enabling the bounce mechanism, (ii) asymptotic saturation to unity during inflation preserving perturbative unitarity, and (iii) positive-definiteness ensuring ghost-freedom. We prove that the sigmoid function emerges uniquely as the minimal-complexity solution satisfying these boundary conditions, with deep connections to hyperbolic geometry and cosmological $\\alpha$-attractors. Through comprehensive numerical validation, we demonstrate that the model achieves 60+ e-folds of inflation following a non-singular bounce without violating the Null Energy Condition. The sigmoid regularization expands the basin of attraction by $\\sim 10^{21}$ compared to the pure exponential metric, achieving 100\\% success rate across 16 orders of magnitude in initial velocities.

Electron flavor anti-neutrino luminosity dominates over electron flavor neutrino luminosity at early times, resulting in a secular increase of the electron fraction in the outer layers of the remnant.

Despite the negative radial temperature gradient, the radial entropy gradient remains positive and the remnant is stably stratified according to the Ledoux criterion for convection. A massive accretion disk is formed from the material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the stars. The disk carries a large fraction of the angular momentum of the system, allowing the remnant massive neutron star to settle to a quasi-steady equilibrium within the region of possible stable rigidly rotating configurations. The remnant is differentially rotating, but it is stable against the magnetorotational instability. Other MHD mechanisms operating on longer timescales are likely responsible for the removal of the differential rotation.

To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle.

In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

    "abstract": "The proper time of an observer can be introduced as a degree of freedom in quantum cosmology, additional to the existing fields. We review two arguments for using the Schrödinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.",

    "title": "Nonadiabatic Origin of Quantum-Metric Effects via Momentum-Space Metric Tensor",
    "abstract": "We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.",

    "abstract": "Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.",

    "abstract": "Assuming a minimal $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$. This preference increases to $\\sim 2.5$-$3\\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\\sum m_\\nu \\ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the structural and physical properties of a strange star admixed with self-interacting bosonic dark matter. The total energy density is modelled as a weighted combination of quark matter and dark matter components regulated by a fixed local volume fraction. The quark component is described by a linear equation of state, while the dark matter follows a mean-field EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these EOSs into a barotropic effective EOS derived from a unified thermodynamic potential, the two-fluid system is reformulated as a thermodynamically closed and mechanically equilibrated configuration. The construction preserves the dynamical distinction between the quark and dark sectors but treats them as a macroscopically unified mixture governed by a single hydrostatic equilibrium equation. This framework identifies the entirely coextensive limit of two-fluid models as a physically meaningful and thermodynamically closed configuration, providing a coherent macroscopic closure that links dark matter-strange matter microphysics to stellar observables. Using the effective EOS, we solve the governing Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius relationship by varying the model parameters. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the $M-R$ profiles, suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the impacts of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. We note that even a modest dark matter admixture softens the effective equation of state and shrinks the maximum mass limit. We discuss the relevance of our investigation in the context of recent observational data available for pulsars, such as XTE J1814-338, PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620 and PSRJ0952-0607.",

    "abstract": "Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.",

The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role.

In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.",

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\\alpha^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",

    "abstract": "The first observation of electroweak production of a photon in association with two forward jets in proton-proton collisions is presented. The measurement uses data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016$-$2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The analysis is performed in a region enriched in photon production via vector boson fusion, with a requirement on the transverse momentum of the photon to exceed 200 GeV. The cross section is measured to be 202$^{+36}_{-32}$ fb, at a significance with respect to the null hypothesis that exceeds five standard deviations. This is in agreement with the standard model prediction of 177$^{+13}_{-12}$ fb. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of various observables. Limits are set on dimension-6 effective field theory operators that contribute to the WW$\\gamma$ interaction. The observed 95% confidence intervals for the corresponding Warsaw basis Wilson coefficients $c_\\mathrm{W}$ and $c_\\mathrm{HWB}$ are [$-$0.11, 0.16] and [$-$1.6, 1.5], respectively.",

Physics reconstruction typically relies on complex detector-specific pipelines that use tens of hand-engineered pattern recognition algorithms or cascades of task-specific neural networks that require extensive, labeled simulation that requires a careful, time-consuming calibration process. We introduce \\textbf{Panda}, a model that learns reusable sensor-level representations directly from raw unlabeled LArTPC data. Panda couples a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective. On a simulated dataset, Panda substantially improves label efficiency and reconstruction quality, beating the previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with 1,000$\\times$ fewer labels. We also show that a single set-prediction head 1/20th the size of the backbone with no physical priors trained on frozen outputs from Panda can result in particle identification that is comparable with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction tools. Full fine-tuning further improves performance across all tasks.",

    "title": "Learning to Reconstruct: A Differentiable Approach to Muon Tracking at the LHC",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles in high-energy collisions requires high precision to ensure reliable event reconstruction and accurate downstream physics analyses. In particular, both precise hit selection and transverse momentum estimation are essential to improve the overall resolution of reconstructed physics observables. Enhanced momentum resolution also enables more efficient trigger threshold settings, leading to more effective data selection within the given data acquisition constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end tracking approach that employs the differentiable programming paradigm to incorporate physics priors directly into a machine learning model. This results in an optimized pipeline capable of simultaneously reconstructing tracks and accurately determining their transverse momenta. The model combines a graph attention network with differentiable clustering and fitting routines, and is trained using a composite loss that, due to its differentiable design, allows physical constraints to be back-propagated effectively through both the neural network and the fitting procedures. This proof of concept shows that introducing differentiable connections within the reconstruction process improves overall performance compared to an equivalent factorized and more standard-like approach, highlighting the potential of integrating physics information through differentiable programming.",

We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies.

The current NO$\\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [0,180^\\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [180^\\circ,360^\\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\\delta_{\\rm CP}\\simeq 270^\\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.",

Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\\%$ of model parameters.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with the Particle Transformer (ParT) representing a leading example of such models. A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT.",

We demonstrate that the $\\rho\\pi^0$ decay mode of the $J/\\psi$ is dominated by strong interaction, while the $\\omega\\pi^0$ mode is dominated by one-photon exchange.

The Monte-Carlo event generator PYTHIA, using its default Monash tune, instead predicts constant strangeness. We investigate a mechanism invoked during hadronization called string closepacking, where overlapping strings generate a background field, here assumed to be predominantly aligned with the beam axis. This increases the effective string tension with rapidity, reducing strangeness suppression and thus enhancing strangeness production. We tune this model to LHC data and contrast it with several alternatives. We comment specifically on the challenge of simultaneously describing the strangeness data and the non-strange p/pi ratio, and introduce a mechanism which may act to suppress the latter. Many of the salient particle-production ratios can be qualitatively described by this model, although the XiC/D ratio and the shape of pT spectra remain challenging to account for.",

    "abstract": "In light of recent high-precision data taken by the BESIII Collaboration, we reconsider the dipion transition $\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$. The strong pion-pion final-state interactions are taken into account model-independently by using dispersion theory. We find that we can reproduce the substructure near the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ threshold observed experimentally without introducing an extra resonance state. While a helicity-flip amplitude plays an important role for the formation of the dip in the invariant-mass distribution, virtual exchange of the charmoniumlike exotic $Z_c(3900)$ state improves the fit quality significantly.",

This database organizes and collects data samples from $e^+e^-$ experiments, which are used as input for the data-driven theoretical evaluation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\\mu}$, serving as a precise test of the Standard Model when compared to the experimental measurements of $a_{\\mu}$. The database is accessible through a custom website ( this https URL ) which contains details about the data samples, such as the treatment of radiative corrections, as well as links to papers on INSPIRE-HEP and to tables on HEPData. The PrecisionSM database was developed within a Joint Research Initiative in the group application of the European hadron physics community, STRONG2020, and is now incorporated into the RadioMonteCarLow2 Working Group (RMCL2 WG) activities, which have the more general goal of improving the theoretical description of scattering processes at $e^+e^-$ colliders. The results of Phase I of the new RMCL2 WG have been published in Aliberti et al, arXiv:hep-ph/ 2410.22882 . In this proceeding, we will report on the status of the PrecisionSM database, which currently contains a list of the dominant $2\\pi$ channel as well as $3\\pi$ and $\\pi^0\\gamma$, and on the ongoing work for the other channels and for responsive plots.",

    "abstract": "Deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, such as $p(\\vec{e},e'\\pi^+)n$, provide opportunities to study the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through differential cross section and beam- and target-spin asymmetry measurements. This work aims to probe the onset of the hard/soft factorization regime through the exclusive $p(\\vec{e},e'\\pi^+)n$ reaction, as measured in the KaonLT experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall C. A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W>2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism. The Regge models better predict $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$, which suggests that the factorization regime is not yet reached.",

We report recent advances in the resummation of small-$x$ logarithms in the gluon sector, focusing on collinear distributions and their interplay with transverse-momentum-dependent formulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of gluon-proton spin correlations and to the emergence of unintegrated gluon densities derived from resummed dynamics. These developments aim to fill the current precision gap in the small-$x$ region and enable robust applications to LHC and future-collider observables.",

    "abstract": "Jet reconstruction remains a critical task in the analysis of data from HEP colliders. We describe in this paper a new, highly performant, Julia package for jet reconstruction, this http URL , which integrates into the growing ecosystem of Julia packages for HEP. With this package users can run sequential reconstruction algorithms for jets. In particular, for LHC events, the Anti-${k}_\\text{T}$, Cambridge/Aachen and Inclusive-${k}_\\text{T}$ algorithms can be used. For FCCee studies the use of alternative algorithms such as the Generalised ${k}_\\text{T}$ for $e^+e^-$ and Durham are also supported. The performance of the core algorithms is better than Fastjet's C++ implementation, for typical LHC and FCCee events, thanks to the Julia compiler's exploitation of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD), as well as ergonomic compact data layouts. The full reconstruction history is made available, allowing inclusive and exclusive jets to be retrieved. The package also provides the means to visualise the reconstruction. Substructure algorithms have been added that allow advanced analysis techniques to be employed. The package can read event data from EDM4hep files and reconstruct jets from these directly, opening the door to FCCee and other future collider studies in Julia.",

Hopes for further study of this process are associated with high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders (SuperKEKb, FCC, CEPC, ILC, CLIC) and gamma-gamma colliders based on the Compton scattering of laser photons on electrons. In this article, we show that there are some very serious background processes where the annihilation of electrons and positrons (real and virtual) produces a pair of photons flying into the detector, and the the remaining products fly away from the detector at small angles.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.",

The dark current rate (DCR) was measured to be $\\sim$ 1 Hz for the $\\sim$ 100 mm$^2$-size SiPMs, or 0.01 Hz/mm$^2$, which is $\\sim$ 7 orders lower than the DCR at room temperature (RT). Given the very low DCR at these cryogenic temperatures, we measured the SiPMs' I-V curves with such a method: illuminated the SiPMs with weak light, which differs from the conventional measurements at RT. Then, we measured the photo-detection efficiency (PDE), after-pulse (AP), and cross-talk (CT) with a bias voltage ranging from overvoltage (OV) 5 to 11 V.

    "abstract": "We study the $h \\to Z\\gamma$ decay within the flavor gauged two Higgs doublet model (FG2HDM). This model extends the Standard Model (SM) to include a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet, under the imposition of a $U(1)'$ flavor gauge symmetry. Compared to the SM, the FG2HDM predicts five additional physical scalars and a neutral gauge boson, $Z'$. The $h \\to Z\\gamma$ decay can be influenced in this model through contributions from either charged Higgs loops or corrections to the fermion-antifermion-$Z$ ($f\\bar{f}Z$) vertex. For the charged Higgs contribution, combining the $\\mu_{Z\\gamma}$ measurement with the more stringent result from $\\mu_{\\gamma\\gamma}$, we identify a parameter region (with $m_{H^\\pm}>200$~GeV and $\\lambda_{hH^+H^-}<0$) that satisfies both constraints at the $1\\sigma$ level. However, due to the larger uncertainty in $\\mu_{Z\\gamma}$, this region is primarily constrained by $\\mu_{\\gamma\\gamma}$. Regarding the vertex corrections, we consider the dominant contribution from the top quark. We find an allowed region in the $\\mathcal{Q}_{tL}$-$\\mathcal{Q}_{tR}$ plane that can simultaneously accommodate $\\mu_{Z\\gamma}$, top quark observables, and $b \\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ data. Similarly, the most stringent constraint in this case originates from $b \\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$, not from $\\mu_{Z\\gamma}$. Future precision measurements of $\\mu_{Z\\gamma}$, which will reduce its current experimental uncertainty, are expected to enhance its capacity to constrain the FG2HDM parameter space.",

This degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass ordering in oscillation experiments if neutrinos have new vectorial interactions with matter. As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth consists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino interactions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe the LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data from XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal couplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we identify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future. We also show that Dark Matter experiments can distinguish new interactions in the muon or tau sector only from new interactions affecting both sectors.",

The fibers are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc 1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterized with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. An imaging test of a lead block was also performed, and the reconstructed results are consistent with the blocks profile. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications.",

    "abstract": "Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit. Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.",

The ratio of first and second order cumulants, $R_{12}^B$, agrees well with corresponding net-proton number cumulants down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.5$ GeV or baryon chemical potentials $\\mu_B/T \\le 2$. Likewise higher-order cumulant ratios, $R_{31}^B$ and $R_{42}^B$, show no sign for the existence of a critical point in the parameter range explored with these cumulant ratios. A QCD critical point is unlikely to occur within the BES-II range in collider mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a non-interacting HRG description breaks down for $\\mu_B/T > 1$. We further analyze baryon-strangeness correlations normalized by strangeness fluctuations, finding consistency with STAR data at large beam energies but deviations at lower energies. Comparisons of electric-charge and strangeness correlations with STAR and ALICE data also show agreement at high energies, while the deviations at lower energies emphasize the role of unobserved strange resonances and the need for controlled feed-down corrections in baryon-strangeness correlations.",

Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.",

We compare our results with the finite volume spectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512, 2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD calculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same physical volume.

In particular, there is a nearly stable $\\sigma$ resonance in our lattice ChEFT calculation, which is absent in the lattice QCD calculation.

This theory predicts a rich spectrum of new fields, including one vector leptoquark, two scalar leptoquarks, a color-octet scalar, and an additional Higgs doublet. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, facilitating viable matter unification at the low scale. We find that this theory predicts that in many cases the dominant leptoquark decays are to the third generation Standard Model quarks and leptons. We identify key experimental signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluate and discuss the limits from current measurements, and outline potential strategies for probing this theory in the near future.",

The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \\sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.",

The current NO$\\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [0,180^\\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [180^\\circ,360^\\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\\delta_{\\rm CP}\\simeq 270^\\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy.

Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with the Particle Transformer (ParT) representing a leading example of such models. A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT.",

Once decay channels into semi-hadronic final states are open, a reliable calculation of inclusive decay rates is only possible if $N$ is heavy enough to permit a perturbative calculation. We adopt the scenario in which $N$ only interacts with SM particles through $N$-$\\nu_\\ell$ mixing, where $\\ell=e,\\mu,\\tau$. Using literature results for $W$ boson correlators calculated to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$, we study the quality of the perturbation series for $N\\to \\ell +\\mbox{hadrons}$ to determine mass ranges for which inclusive decay widths can be predicted robustly.

This increases the effective string tension with rapidity, reducing strangeness suppression and thus enhancing strangeness production. We tune this model to LHC data and contrast it with several alternatives. We comment specifically on the challenge of simultaneously describing the strangeness data and the non-strange p/pi ratio, and introduce a mechanism which may act to suppress the latter. Many of the salient particle-production ratios can be qualitatively described by this model, although the XiC/D ratio and the shape of pT spectra remain challenging to account for.",

Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square radius, $\\langle r^{2}\\rangle^{1/2} \\approx 0.70-0.80$ fm, which is significantly less than 1 fm, provides compelling evidence that these are compact tetraquarks rather than loosely bound hadronic molecules.",

The phase can be affected by the presence of a background field and can be accompanied by nontrivial topological features. The appearance of adiabatic geometric phases in momentum space is demonstrated for a Lorentz-violating Weyl fermion, where the role of the background is played by the coefficients for Lorentz violation. As explicit examples, the Berry curvature and the first Chern number are derived for two cases with large Lorentz violation, one incorporating CPT violation and one preserving CPT symmetry. Some alternative topological invariants are also obtained. In certain scenarios with large Lorentz violation, the physical vacuum is associated with a topological phase.",

Our model employs the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\\Sigma$$\\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The rare exclusive decay of the Higgs boson $H \\to J/\\psi + \\gamma$ is an important channel for measuring the Yukawa coupling of the charm quark. In this article, we analyze the process by employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Conventional scale setting leads to theoretical predictions affected by errors dominated by renormalization scale uncertainty. The PMC provides a systematic method to eliminate this renormalization scale uncertainty by resumming non-conformal $\\beta$ contributions into the QCD running coupling via renormalization group equation (RGE). We obtain a PMC scale result of $Q_\\star = 3.29\\ \\text{GeV}$, which reflects the low virtuality of the underlying QCD dynamics for the $H \\to J/\\psi + \\gamma$ process. In fact, this is an order of magnitude smaller than the guessed scale using the conventional method, i.e., $\\mu_r = m_H/2$. By removing non-conformal $\\{\\beta_i\\}$-terms from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) series, the PMC eliminates renormalization scale uncertainty. Comparing results, we find that the PMC NLO QCD correction term is significantly enhanced, while the PMC NNLO QCD correction is suppressed. This indicates improved convergence of the pQCD series up to NNLO. Finally, we determine the decay width $\\Gamma(H \\to J/\\psi + \\gamma) = 14.183^{+0.249}_{-0.347} \\pm 0.022$ eV, where the first error arises from the factorization scale $\\mu_\\Lambda \\in [1, 2]\\ \\text{GeV}$, and the second error from estimating unknown higher-order terms using the Pade approximant approach. The corresponding branching fraction is $\\mathcal{B}(H \\to J/\\psi + \\gamma) = 3.485_{-0.161}^{+0.152} \\times 10^{-6}$.",

It is found that with the variation of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent, the momentum spectrum exhibits the more pronounced oscillations, shifting and broadening. The total yield of created particles increases monotonically with the increase of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent in the high-frequency fields with small chirp and low-frequency fields with any chirp. Meanwhile, the total yield of created particles under the super-Gaussian pulse electric fields is approximately twice that produced with the usual Gaussian pulse envelope. These results can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the form of external field to enhance the vacuum pair production rate.",

    "abstract": "One of the most remarkable observations in heavy-ion collisions is the systematic regularity exhibited by pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles across collision energies. While single-source models fail at higher energies and independent multi-source approaches do not reproduce the central dip observed at LHC energies, a unified description across the full RHIC-LHC energy range remains elusive. These distributions from Au+Au collisions at RHIC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6--200 GeV) and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76--5.36 TeV) are analyzed using a novel parametrization based on coupled Gaussian sources where the interaction strength is quantified by parameter $\\lambda$. This coupled two-source model captures the interaction between forward and backward sources through the medium formed in the collision. Remarkably, $\\lambda$ exhibits empirical scaling behavior resembling $1/\\mu_B$, suggesting sensitivity to baryon stopping and the strongly-interacting medium. All fitting parameters follow systematic energy trends, with the peak-to-peak distance and chemical freeze-out temperature exhibiting identical exponential saturation patterns, indicating that geometric expansion and thermal evolution share a common underlying dynamics governed by QCD phase structure. Furthermore, the approach naturally preserves limiting fragmentation behavior across all energies, in contrast to independent source models that suggest its violation at LHC energies. Although the theoretical basis requires further investigation, these empirical correlations successfully unify charged particle production across nearly two orders of magnitude in collision energy, revealing fundamental connections to underlying collision dynamics.",

It is found that neutrinos can acquire masses not only from the usual light quark loop corrections but also from the light quark condensates. The latter contribution has been overlooked in the literature. We show that both contributions are comparable for operators involving $u$ and $d$ quarks, while quark loop corrections dominate for operators involving the $s$ quark. Using the low-energy effective field theory extended with light right-handed neutrinos and matching to chiral perturbation theory, we systematically analyze these contributions, deriving constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients from neutrino mass bounds, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and light pseudoscalar meson invisible decays. Our analysis shows that electron neutrino mass measurements provide the most stringent constraints on these scalar couplings, significantly improving upon limits from other observables. The results highlight the importance of including both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions in complete phenomenological analyses of neutrino mass generation mechanisms.",

We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory.

    "title": "A Review on Intense Electromagnetic Fields in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Theoretical Predictions and Experimental Results",
    "abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies, the incident nuclei travel at nearly the speed of light. These collisions deposit kinetic energy into the overlap region and create a high-temperature environment where hadrons ``melt'' into deconfined quarks and gluons. The spectator nucleons, which do not undergo scatterings, generate an ultra-intense electromagnetic field -- on the order of $10^{18}$ Gauss at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, and $10^{19}$ Gauss at the Large Hadron Collider. These powerful electromagnetic fields have a significant impact on the produced particles, not only complicating the study of particle interactions but also inducing novel physical phenomena. To explore the nature of these fields and their interactions with deconfined quarks, we provide a detailed overview, encompassing theoretical estimations of their generation and evolution, as well as experimental efforts to detect them. We also provide physical interpretations of the discovered results and discuss potential directions for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "Three-body forces, as a type of non-perturbative strong interaction, are widely discussed in studies of nuclear properties. However, whether their inclusion is necessary in nuclear systems remains a topic of intense debate. In this letter, we propose that the existence of three-body forces in certain three-body hadronic systems with definite $C$ parity is certain. Such systems consist of two components whose interactions are mediated by three-body forces a mechanism not easily realized in conventional three-nucleon systems. We investigate two specific three-body hadronic systems, $\\bar{D}_sDK$ and $\\bar{D}^*D\\eta$, using contact-range potentials. The two-body hadron-hadron interactions are constrained by reproducing their scattering lengths, while the three-body couplings are constrained by charge symmetry. Our results indicate that three-body forces play a minor role in binding the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\\bar{D}_sDK$ system, but a crucial one in binding the $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ $\\bar{D}^*D\\eta$ system. In fact, three-body forces determine whether $\\bar{D} ^*D\\eta$ forms a bound state, making this system a promising candidate for exploring three-body forces in hadronic physics.",

Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role.",

    "abstract": "This PhD thesis explores the potential of quantum computing to address computational challenges in high-energy physics (HEP). As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.",

In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning.

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram.

Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars.

    "abstract": "Deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, such as $p(\\vec{e},e'\\pi^+)n$, provide opportunities to study the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through differential cross section and beam- and target-spin asymmetry measurements. This work aims to probe the onset of the hard/soft factorization regime through the exclusive $p(\\vec{e},e'\\pi^+)n$ reaction, as measured in the KaonLT experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall C. A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W>2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism. The Regge models better predict $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$, which suggests that the factorization regime is not yet reached.",

We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \\gtrsim 50\\ h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.",

The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.",

    "abstract": "We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \\mathcal{O}(10)\\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \\ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\\Lambda$ + axion framework.",

We here discuss means to accelerate the generation of unweighted events based on a two-stage rejection-sampling algorithm that employs neural-network surrogates for unweighting the hard-process matrix elements. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed algorithm based on factorisation-aware neural networks to the case of multijet merging at tree-level accuracy. We thereby account for several non-trivial aspects of realistic event-simulation setups, including biased phase-space sampling, partial unweighting, and the mapping of partonic subprocesses. We apply our methods to the production of Z+jets final states at the HL-LHC using the Sherpa event generator, including matrix elements with up to six final-state partons. When using neural-network surrogates for the dominant Z+5 jets and Z+6 jets partonic processes, we find a reduction in the total event-generation time by more than a factor of 10 compared to baseline Sherpa.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the structural and physical properties of a strange star admixed with self-interacting bosonic dark matter. The total energy density is modelled as a weighted combination of quark matter and dark matter components regulated by a fixed local volume fraction. The quark component is described by a linear equation of state, while the dark matter follows a mean-field EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these EOSs into a barotropic effective EOS derived from a unified thermodynamic potential, the two-fluid system is reformulated as a thermodynamically closed and mechanically equilibrated configuration. The construction preserves the dynamical distinction between the quark and dark sectors but treats them as a macroscopically unified mixture governed by a single hydrostatic equilibrium equation. This framework identifies the entirely coextensive limit of two-fluid models as a physically meaningful and thermodynamically closed configuration, providing a coherent macroscopic closure that links dark matter-strange matter microphysics to stellar observables. Using the effective EOS, we solve the governing Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius relationship by varying the model parameters. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the $M-R$ profiles, suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the impacts of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. We note that even a modest dark matter admixture softens the effective equation of state and shrinks the maximum mass limit. We discuss the relevance of our investigation in the context of recent observational data available for pulsars, such as XTE J1814-338, PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620 and PSRJ0952-0607.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.",

As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth consists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino interactions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe the LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data from XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal couplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we identify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future.

Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role.

In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.",

In this work, we update the spectrum of heavy hybrid mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors using the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, by incorporating the latest lattice QCD results for hybrid static potentials. We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results.

    "abstract": "Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.",

The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\\Lambda$ at $<10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.",

While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, by considering BH mergers within SIDM spikes, which can arise from models with a massive force mediator, we show that the GWs emitted are dephased in a distinct manner. To incorporate the feedback of the BH orbital motion that can significantly modify the DM profiles, we use $N$-body simulations to analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.",

We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.",

    "abstract": "Assuming a minimal $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$.

Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator. To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.",

This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \\sim 0.67\\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\\gtrsim6\\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.",

The Koonin-Pratt and Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formulae provide useful expressions of the correlation functions and have been widely used to analyze the experimental data based on the assumption that the effect of higher partial waves is negligible. Those formulae can be generalized for higher partial waves, but the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula produces wrong results due to a singular behavior of the asymptotic wave function at the origin. In this study, we attempt to solve the problem by regularizing the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula with a cutoff and validate it using the Koonin-Pratt formula as a reference. We also show the relationship between the cutoff in the regularized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz and the effective-range correction in the original Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula. Using the obtained formula, we investigate the source-size dependence, the validity of the effective range expansion, and the cutoff dependence of the correlation function.

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\\alpha^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",

    "title": "A Bootstrap Study of Confinement in AdS",
    "abstract": "Yang-Mills theory in AdS$_{4}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions is expected to undergo a transition as the AdS radius varies, since the boundary data is incompatible with confinement in flat space. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.",

    "abstract": "The thermal partition function, $Z$, of a $CFT_d$ on $S^{d-1}$ is parameterized by the inverse temperature $\\beta$ along with $\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor$ angular velocities $\\omega_i$. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of this partition function when $n$ of the $\\omega_i$ are scaled to unity (the largest allowed value) at fixed values of the other $(\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor-n)$ angular velocities. We argue that $\\ln Z$ develops a simple pole in $(1-\\omega_i)$ for each $\\omega_i$ that is scaled to unity. The residue of this product of poles is a theory dependent (so non-universal) function of $\\beta$ and the fixed angular velocities. The inverse Laplace transformation of this partition function constrains the functional form of the field theory entropy as a function of charges in a limit in which angular momenta and the twist are scaled as follows. While $n$ special angular momenta $J_1\\ldots J_n$ are scaled to infinity, the twist and the other angular momenta - collectively denoted $x_i$ - are also taken to infinity but at the slower rate that ensures that the scaled charges $x_i/(J_1 J_2 \\ldots J_n)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ are held fixed. In this limit, we demonstrate that the scaled entropy $S/(J_1 J_2 \\ldots J_n)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ depends only on the $\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor-n+1$ scaled charges defined above (the precise form of this dependence is non-universal). We verify our predictions (and compute all non-universal functions) in the case of free scalar theories (which show surprisingly rich behaviour) as well as large $N$, strongly coupled ${\\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory. The last theory is analyzed in the bulk via the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the scaling limit described above, its phase diagram displays sharp phase transitions between black hole, grey galaxy, and thermal gas phases.",

In this case, in addition to the standard invariant tensor $\\delta^{ij}$, there exists another invariant tensor $\\epsilon^{ij}$, which enables the construction of genuinely new realizations beyond the conventional one. We show that these new realizations arise from a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$--grading of the mode index $n$ of the Virasoro generators $L_n$ and the space of such realizations corresponds to points of a possibly singular algebraic variety. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ cases, the space of all such constructions is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, while for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ it forms a non-compact real four-dimensional manifold. We show that the spaces of constructions for $Z_{2N}$ and $Z_{2N+1}$ are closely similar. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem within an action-principle framework by introducing $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariant maps, which provide a systematic method for constructing conformal field theories endowed with these generalized Virasoro symmetries. This formulation reproduces the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ case and supports the idea that $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariance offers a consistent and unified approach to generating extended conformal algebras.

We calculate the cylinder partition function. We first place the cylindrical worldsheet on a rectangular lattice before taking the continuum limit. We find an integer number of string configurations on the worldsheet, which we call line defects, that run from one boundary of the cylinder to the other. We insert two sources (conical defects) at each boundary and fix the two ends of the line defect by Dirichlet boundary conditions to a point $r_c$ in target space. In target space, a line defect appears as an Susskind\\&Uglum-type open string ending on $r_c$. We compute the semiclassical contribution to the off-shell cylinder amplitude by saddle point approximation. The amplitude has an interesting infrared (IR) divergence structure that depends on the given range of the cone angle. We then compute the entropy by varying the cone angle. In a particular renormalization scheme that relates the ultraviolet (UV) and to the infrared (IR) limits of the modulus integral, we find the entropy to be free of IR divergences but linearly dependent on the radial cutoff. We argue that our calculation provides a well-defined state on a constant Euclidean-time slice directly from the string worldsheet. We also study the 2D flat cone NLSM without discretization. We compute the entropy from the off-shell stationary action and show it is finite in each winding sector $W$ with a maximum at $r_c=\\sqrt{\\alpha'}/|W|$. After summing over all winding sectors, it still has a finite maximum in the UV limit but for $r_c >0$.",

The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT.

This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes.

Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry.

The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.",

The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.",

The current NO$\\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [0,180^\\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\\delta_{\\rm CP} \\in [180^\\circ,360^\\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\\delta_{\\rm CP}\\simeq 270^\\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.",

These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.",

    "title": "Quantum ramp secret sharing from Haar scrambling",
    "abstract": "Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.",

Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\\Sigma$$\\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Accurate gluon densities at small $x$ are essential for reducing theoretical uncertainties in collider predictions, yet remain one of the least constrained ingredients in global analyses. We report recent advances in the resummation of small-$x$ logarithms in the gluon sector, focusing on collinear distributions and their interplay with transverse-momentum-dependent formulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of gluon-proton spin correlations and to the emergence of unintegrated gluon densities derived from resummed dynamics. These developments aim to fill the current precision gap in the small-$x$ region and enable robust applications to LHC and future-collider observables.",

While this could be naively expected it is not completely trivial because of higher spins exchanged. We give a naive argument based on a very simple model of why this can reasonably be expected and we check on the explicit examples that the intuition derived from the model is sensible. Furthermore we discuss the complications due to null states (BRST exact states) in actually computing the covariant bosonic string spectrum and how these can be overcome by using a ``$\\Pi$ gauge'' which makes manifest that the degeneration of any spin at any mass level is independent on the spacetime dimension as predicted by Curtright et al at the end of 90s.",

To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle.

We review two arguments for using the Schrödinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.",

In this work, we use this formalism to study a number of properties of string amplitudes at tree-level and one-loop. We introduce several global prescriptions for an integration contour for which the integrals are finite everywhere in kinematic space. At tree-level, this is done in two ways: one directly implements the Feynman $i\\varepsilon$ to analytically continue from Euclidean to Lorentzian worldsheets; the other is a generalization of the closed Pochhammer contour to arbitrary number of points. At loop-level, we present a systematic way of extracting cuts directly from the worldsheet integrand. This provides a powerful set of unitarity constraints, which we use to test the consistency of different \"stringy\" UV regularizations of field theory amplitudes. In addition, we identify the massive threshold expansion of the integrand, which allows us to reduce the problem to a finite set of Feynman integrals in Schwinger parametrization and provide a straightforward contour prescription reminiscent of its field-theory version.",

Within this throat, one can argue that two-dimensional JT gravity is the appropriate effective theory that dominates at low temperature. Here, we discuss how to capture this effective description by standing far away from the horizon. Our strategy is to construct a phase space within gravitational theories in AdS$_{d+1}$ that fixes the radial dependence while keeping the transverse dependence arbitrary. This allows us to implement a decoupling limit directly on the phase space while keeping the coordinates fixed. With this, we can relate the effective description in JT gravity to the CFT$_d$ description at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$, which we do explicitly in AdS$_3$ and non-rotating configurations in AdS$_4$. From the perspective of the dual CFT, our decoupling limit should be understood as a flow between a CFT$_{d}$ and a near-CFT$_1$. Our analysis shows that local counterterms can be constructed in the near-CFT$_1$, which arise from the anomalies (or absence of them) in the CFT$_{d}$. We show that one of these counterterms is the Schwarzian effective action, making this sector a scheme-dependent choice. This illustrates the delicate interplay between a far and a near analysis of near-extremal black holes.",

The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator. To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.",

    "abstract": "We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop. The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\\text{pert}}[C]\\, e^{-\\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \\ge \\sqrt{2}\\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement. The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \\in H^{1/2}(\\mathbb{S}^1,\\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\\kappa \\sim \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.",

We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\\alpha^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",

The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below for the case of fixed spatial vector magnitude. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source.

In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

We find a perturbative upper bound on scalaron magnitude that matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density near the pivot scale.

Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.",

Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters.

This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.",

In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability.

In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.",

For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.",

The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.",

In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.",

The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\\partial S_{q,s}/\\partial U=1/\\vert T\\vert^{q}_{\\pm}$, which recovers $\\partial S_{BG}/\\partial U=1/T$ \\cite{Clausius1865} as $q\\rightarrow1$.",

This study presents a novel Physics-Driven Deep Learning (PDDL) framework for modeling the complex solid-liquid phase transition in a two-dimensional PCM-based TES system integrated with finned heat exchangers. The system operates under transient forced convection with cooling air, presenting a challenging Moving Boundary Problem (MBP) characterized by intricate phase interface dynamics and strong geometrical dependencies. Conventional numerical methods for such Stefan problems face significant computational burdens due to repeated meshing requirements at the evolving interface. To overcome these limitations, we develop a multi-network PDDL approach that simultaneously predicts the solid phase temperature field, fin temperature distribution, and the moving phase boundary position. The architecture employs three specialized deep neural networks operating in parallel, constrained by the governing physical laws of energy conservation and interface conditions. Comprehensive validation against established analytical benchmarks demonstrates the framework's exceptional accuracy in predicting interface evolution and temperature distributions across various aspect ratios. The model successfully captures the parametric influence of geometrical parameter on solidification rates and thermal performance without requiring mesh regeneration. Our approach provides an efficient computational paradigm for optimizing PCM based TES systems and offers extensibility to three-dimensional configurations and multi-material composites, presenting significant potential for advanced thermal energy system design.",

In the limit of infinite matrix size, and when the time parameter is restricted to integer values, the second-order SFF reproduces the standard result established in earlier studies. When the time parameter is of order one relative to the matrix size, we demonstrate that the second-order SFF grows logarithmically with the ensemble dimension.

    "abstract": "Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.",

The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant.

Here we propose a new variational principle to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schrödinger equation, but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description of the dynamics of a physical system.",

    "abstract": "A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schrödinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincaré algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.",

    "abstract": "Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.",

Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap.

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.",

For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed.

Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected. We analyze the equilibrium points of the homogeneous system, along with their stability and bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore, adopting the Turing approach for reaction-diffusion systems, we investigate the diffusion-driven instability and the emergence of spatial regular structures (stationary in time), i.e. the patterns.

This stands in contrast to the classical problem of statistical inference from trajectory data. We establish unique identifiability results under several key scenarios, including cases with both multiplicative and additive noise, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Our analysis leverages the intrinsic structure of the governing equations and their quantitative relationship with the ergodic measure, thereby transforming the identifiability problem into a uniqueness issue for the solutions to the associated stationary Fokker-Planck equations. This approach reveals fundamental differences between drift and diffusion inversion problems and provides counterexamples where unique recovery fails.

However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.",

This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes.

    "abstract": "We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.",

Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \\mathbb{N}\\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.",

In the case of 4-valent maps, our methodology leads to explicit expressions for map counts. For general even or mixed valence, the number of vertices of the map specifies the relevant order of the derivatives of the generating function that needs to be considered. Beyond summarizing our own results, we provide context for the program highlighted in this article through a brief review of the literature describing advances in map enumeration. In addition, we discuss open problems and challenges related to this fascinating area of research that stands at the intersection of statistical physics, random matrices, orthogonal polynomials, and discrete dynamical systems theory.",

The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \\cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter. Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects. We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.",

The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.",

The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279 , arXiv 2311.09151 ] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media.

Finding a higher categorical analogue of a dagger category is therefore key to the foundations of quantum field theory. In this work, we present a coherent definition of \\emph{dagger $(\\infty,n)$-category} in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category.

We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant.

This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

    "title": "Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations",
    "abstract": "To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called \"projective decomposition\". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.",

This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savaré theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t>0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.",

We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution.",

To clarify the relation between coupling strength and mean escape time, we derive effective one-dimensional dynamics: nonlinear mean-field Fokker-Planck equation in the weak-coupling regime, stochastic mean-field dynamics in the strong-coupling regime, and deterministic mean-field dynamics in the intermediate regime. We validate these reduced descriptions by comparing predictions with numerical simulations. We identify a distinct dominant driving factor of escape processes in each regime. Notably, the three escape mechanisms emerge through the interplay of nonlinearity, diffusive coupling, and dynamical noise -- rather than bifurcations of the noise-free system. Our approach serves as a framework applicable to other diffusively coupled stochastic nonlinear systems, motivating a further search for similar synergistic phenomena.",

However, a single oscillator or cyclic loop of states is typically employed at each site in theories and simulations. Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies.",

The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations. These findings may facilitate deeper understanding of soliton/breather interactions beyond conventional multi-soliton systems and bound-state complexes in SOC BEC.",

A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response. Across dynamic, partially blocked simulated environments, we observe low miss rates and stable throughput with interpretable, tunable trade-offs over carrier count, arrival rate, hazard density, and hazard sensitivity $\\kappa$. We derive that a characteristic hydraulic length scale $\\ell\\approx\\sqrt{D/\\lambda}$ predicts recruitment range in a continuum approximation, and we provide a work-conservation (Ohm-law) bound consistent with sublinear capacity scaling with team size. Empirically: (i) soft hazard penalties yield fewer misses when obstacles already block motion; (ii) throughput saturates sublinearly with carriers while reliability improves sharply; (iii) stronger arrivals can reduce misses by sustaining sinks that recruit help; and (iv) phase-stability regions shrink with hazard density but are recovered by more carriers or higher arrivals. We refer to X-SYCON as an instance of Distributed Passive Computation and Control, and we evaluate it in simulations modeling communication-denied disaster response and other constrained sensing-action regimes.",

    "abstract": "We analyze a thermodynamically consistent model of CMOS-based ring oscillators near the onset of coherent voltage oscillations. For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how societies react to epidemic threats requires more than tracking infection curves. Public perception, collective memory and behavioural adaptation interact through feedback loops that can amplify or suppress the spread of fear, vigilance and precaution. In this work we reinterpret the classical Lorenz system in a socioepidemic context, governed by nonlinear interactions between perceived infection, social transmission behaviour and memory of past risk. We provide a qualitative analysis of the model and show that small fluctuations in perception or behaviour can trigger transitions between stable, oscillatory and chaotic collective responses. These results suggest that social reactions to epidemics may evolve according to intrinsic dynamical rules, generating complex patterns of vigilance, fatigue and renewed concern that mirror the irregular rhythms observed in real outbreaks. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating behavioural feedbacks into epidemic modeling and reveal how chaotic dynamics may arise not only from pathogens but from society itself.",

    "abstract": "Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete. The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group. When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks. The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.",

    "abstract": "Topological dislocations in otherwise periodic lattices represent global structural defects that, nevertheless, typically leave the lattice periodicity intact far from the dislocation. Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created.",

    "abstract": "We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \\alpha < 2$.",

    "abstract": "The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.",

The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.",

Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.",

Using this framework, we identify a trade-off between the speed and accuracy of collective pattern formation and, by adapting techniques from stochastic chemical kinetics, quantify how information flows between cells during patterning. Our analysis reveals counterintuitive features of collective patterning: globally optimized solutions do not necessarily maximize intercellular information transfer and individual cells may appear suboptimal in isolation. Moreover, the model predicts that instantaneous information shared between cells can be non-monotonic in time as patterning occurs.

This work aims to probe the onset of the hard/soft factorization regime through the exclusive $p(\\vec{e},e'\\pi^+)n$ reaction, as measured in the KaonLT experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall C. A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W>2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $\\sigma_{LT'}/\\sigma_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive algebraic structure to calculate coincidence probabilities of a general decay scheme for gamma ray spectroscopy, we model the decay scheme, rather naturally, as a quiver through which we define a decay quiver. The path algebra of quivers is the underlying, more general, algebra for transition matrices that is typically used in modeling decay schemes. The path algebra allows for concatenation of transitions which affords the calculation of cascade probabilities. We extend the path algebra to allow for the multiplication of non-composable paths, i.e., transition that don't directly share a level connecting them. We define the coincidence algebra as the algebra that allows for such an extension and realize it as the fibres for a coincidence algebra bundle, the base space of which is the path algebra where decay schemes live. A given decay schemes coincidence probabilities are calculated on its fibre. \\textit{Detection maps} are defined as linear maps on the base space that map transition probabilities to detected probabilities.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed ``imaging-by-smashing\" technique has emerged as a powerful approach to connect final-state collective flow phenomena in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions with the intrinsic structure of the colliding nuclei. While most efforts have focused on constraining nuclear shape properties such as deformation and triaxiality, less attention has been given to the neutron skin, primarily in heavy nuclei such as $^{208}$Pb. In this work, a novel study of the neutron-skin thickness in $^{48}$Ca is presented, based on comparative analyses of $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Simulations within the AMPT framework are employed to investigate the impact of varying neutron-skin thicknesses $\\Delta r_{np}$ for $^{48}$Ca on collective flow observables, including anisotropic flow coefficients and mean transverse momentum ($[p_{\\rm T}]$) fluctuations. The triangular flow $v_3$, quadrangular flow $v_4$, as well as the variance and skewness of $[p_{\\rm T}]$ fluctuations, display notable sensitivity to $\\Delta r_{np}$. These findings indicate that calcium-isotope runs at the LHC could provide an independent and complementary approach to constraining $\\Delta r_{np}$, with the potential to help resolve the current tension between PREX and CREX measurements.",

    "abstract": "Dielectrons from heavy flavor hadron decays not only constitute a crucial background to their thermal spectrum in high-energy nuclear collisions, from which the temperature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is extracted, but also provide a valuable probe of heavy quark interactions with the QGP. Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role.",

Systematic uncertainties arising from detector effects have been carefully evaluated.

We performed simulations compatible with the experimental conditions of the MAMI (University of Mainz) and CLAS (Jefferson Lab) facilities. We have computed cross sections and evaluated the main backgrounds. MAMI is a three-spectrometer system with extremely good energy resolution and small acceptances. We found that, by choosing specific values of the final particle's momenta, the shell structure can be well resolved, with negligible background contributions. CLAS is a large solid angle detector with poorer energy resolution. In both cases, the background can be kept under control by performing cuts in missing energy and missing momentum; however, in CLAS, the shell structure cannot be resolved due to the energy resolution. We conclude that MAMI is particularly appropriate for the proposed experiment, whereas CLAS is better suited for other studies.",

With a momentum capability reaching 11 GeV/c, the SHMS provides measurements of charged particles produced in electron-scattering experiments using the maximum available beam energy from the upgraded Jefferson Lab accelerator. The SHMS is an ion-optics magnetic spectrometer comprised of a series of new superconducting magnets which transport charged particles through an array of triggering, tracking, and particle-identification detectors that measure momentum, energy, angle and position in order to allow kinematic reconstruction of the events back to their origin at the scattering target. The detector system is protected from background radiation by a sophisticated shielding enclosure. The entire spectrometer is mounted on a rotating support structure which permits measurements to be taken with a large acceptance over laboratory scattering angles from 5.5 to 40 degrees, thus allowing a wide range of low cross-section experiments to be conducted. These experiments complement and extend the previous Hall C research program to higher energies.",

Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron-star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.",

    "title": "Deblurring fission fragment mass distributions",
    "abstract": "Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \\cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \\cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \\cgmf{}, and we compare the \\cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \\cgmf{} results.",

Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed ``imaging-by-smashing\" technique has emerged as a powerful approach to connect final-state collective flow phenomena in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions with the intrinsic structure of the colliding nuclei. While most efforts have focused on constraining nuclear shape properties such as deformation and triaxiality, less attention has been given to the neutron skin, primarily in heavy nuclei such as $^{208}$Pb. In this work, a novel study of the neutron-skin thickness in $^{48}$Ca is presented, based on comparative analyses of $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Simulations within the AMPT framework are employed to investigate the impact of varying neutron-skin thicknesses $\\Delta r_{np}$ for $^{48}$Ca on collective flow observables, including anisotropic flow coefficients and mean transverse momentum ($[p_{\\rm T}]$) fluctuations. The triangular flow $v_3$, quadrangular flow $v_4$, as well as the variance and skewness of $[p_{\\rm T}]$ fluctuations, display notable sensitivity to $\\Delta r_{np}$. These findings indicate that calcium-isotope runs at the LHC could provide an independent and complementary approach to constraining $\\Delta r_{np}$, with the potential to help resolve the current tension between PREX and CREX measurements.",

The calculation of two-body phase shifts and ground-state energies for up to five $^4$He atoms in a theory with only contact interactions shows that, as long as it remains smaller or comparable to the experimental effective range, the fake range does not alter the convergence of the EFT expansion but is often beneficial at the lowest orders.

However, whether their inclusion is necessary in nuclear systems remains a topic of intense debate. In this letter, we propose that the existence of three-body forces in certain three-body hadronic systems with definite $C$ parity is certain. Such systems consist of two components whose interactions are mediated by three-body forces a mechanism not easily realized in conventional three-nucleon systems. We investigate two specific three-body hadronic systems, $\\bar{D}_sDK$ and $\\bar{D}^*D\\eta$, using contact-range potentials. The two-body hadron-hadron interactions are constrained by reproducing their scattering lengths, while the three-body couplings are constrained by charge symmetry. Our results indicate that three-body forces play a minor role in binding the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\\bar{D}_sDK$ system, but a crucial one in binding the $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ $\\bar{D}^*D\\eta$ system. In fact, three-body forces determine whether $\\bar{D} ^*D\\eta$ forms a bound state, making this system a promising candidate for exploring three-body forces in hadronic physics.",

Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role.",

As a decisive factor, the uncertainty of $S_{\\rm p}$ has been improved from 411 keV (Bayesian Machine Learning, BML) to 89 keV (BNN-BH) by taking the ensemble uncertainty into account and confining the error estimation to the neighboring nuclei. In consequence, the magnitude of the half-life's uncertainty can be reduced from 4 orders to 1 order, compared to that ($5.5_{-5.3}^{+636}$ ns) with $S_{\\rm p}$ from the BML model. We also found that the range of half-life predicted by the TRHBc + WKB approach is consistent with those from the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) + WKB approach, and with those from an empirical formalism with the $S_{\\rm p}$ obtained with the BNN-BH model.

We found that, by choosing specific values of the final particle's momenta, the shell structure can be well resolved, with negligible background contributions. CLAS is a large solid angle detector with poorer energy resolution. In both cases, the background can be kept under control by performing cuts in missing energy and missing momentum; however, in CLAS, the shell structure cannot be resolved due to the energy resolution. We conclude that MAMI is particularly appropriate for the proposed experiment, whereas CLAS is better suited for other studies.",

Previous calculations using the BCS approximation showed an enhancement of pair transfer, relative to treatments with no pairing, but failed to reproduce the observed enhancement factor between one- and two-neutron transfer probabilities. This work aims to microscopically investigate the dynamics of $^{40,48}$Ca + $^{96}$Zr head-on collisions below the Coulomb barrier, focusing on the role of pairing correlations in neutron transfer. We employ time-dependent energy density functional theory extended to superfluid systems, TDSLDA. Transfer probabilities, including contributions to specific $K$-angular momentum projections, are extracted using projection operators and compared to results from calculations without pairing. Our calculations show that pairing is correlated to the dynamic deformability of the nucleus, which influences mean neutron transfer in sub-barrier reactions. We also show that TDSLDA reproduces the experimentally observed enhancement factor by significantly increasing the probability of transferring a neutron pair in the $K = 0$ spin channel. These results confirm the strong influence of pairing and structure on sub-barrier multi-nucleon transfer, and demonstrate that TDSLDA provides a reliable microscopic framework for describing the interplay between nuclear superfluidity and reaction dynamics.",

A partial--wave analysis identifies the dominant $J^{\\pi}$ contributions in each channel and relates them to specific $^{8}$Be resonances, while demonstrating that cluster polarization, previously shown to be crucial for the $^{8}$Be spectrum, is likewise essential for the normalization and energy dependence of several $S$ factors.

The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance.",

These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter.

This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations.",

Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \\ M_\\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\\sim 1\\ M_\\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\\ \\rho_0$, where $\\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\\ \\rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores.

Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron-star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \\cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \\cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \\cgmf{}, and we compare the \\cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \\cgmf{} results.",

At 3.0 GeV, the JAM model reproduces the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling violation observed by STAR, as well as the particle ordering ($K^0_S > p > \\pi^+$). Model calculations of the centrality dependence indicate that the scaling violation mainly originates from hadronic interactions rather than spectator effects, while the rapidity dependence further constrains the mechanism of the scaling breaking and the underlying longitudinal dynamics. At 4.5 GeV, partonic interactions in the AMPT-String Melting mode significantly enhance NCQ scaling, and turning off final-state hadronic rescattering further clarifies the scaling pattern, highlighting the increasing role of partonic degrees of freedom. The energy dependence of the $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ is also examined within these models.",

The Koonin-Pratt and Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formulae provide useful expressions of the correlation functions and have been widely used to analyze the experimental data based on the assumption that the effect of higher partial waves is negligible. Those formulae can be generalized for higher partial waves, but the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula produces wrong results due to a singular behavior of the asymptotic wave function at the origin. In this study, we attempt to solve the problem by regularizing the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula with a cutoff and validate it using the Koonin-Pratt formula as a reference. We also show the relationship between the cutoff in the regularized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz and the effective-range correction in the original Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula. Using the obtained formula, we investigate the source-size dependence, the validity of the effective range expansion, and the cutoff dependence of the correlation function. We also discuss the interaction dependence using the heatmap as a function of the scattering-length parameter $1/a_l$ and the momentum $q$.",

The dependence of their masses as a function of isospin projection shows evidence for deviations from quadratic behavior indicating isospin violation beyond the expectation from two- body forces. The deviation is most pronounced for the 2+ states. Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling.",

The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.",

Incidents (demands) and obstructions (hazards) continually write diffusing and decaying scalar fields, and agents greedily ascend a local utility $U=\\phi_{\\mathrm{DE}}-\\kappa\\,\\phi_{\\mathrm{HZ}}$ with light anti-congestion and separation. A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response.

We derive that a characteristic hydraulic length scale $\\ell\\approx\\sqrt{D/\\lambda}$ predicts recruitment range in a continuum approximation, and we provide a work-conservation (Ohm-law) bound consistent with sublinear capacity scaling with team size. Empirically: (i) soft hazard penalties yield fewer misses when obstacles already block motion; (ii) throughput saturates sublinearly with carriers while reliability improves sharply; (iii) stronger arrivals can reduce misses by sustaining sinks that recruit help; and (iv) phase-stability regions shrink with hazard density but are recovered by more carriers or higher arrivals.

Existing rigid or affine registration methods fail to model such complex deformations, whereas traditional non-rigid techniques tend to overfit and lack robustness in sparse-texture sonar data. To address these challenges, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical non-rigid registration framework tailored for large-scale side-scan sonar images. Our method begins with a global Thin Plate Spline initialization from sparse correspondences, followed by superpixel-guided segmentation that partitions the image into structurally consistent patches preserving terrain integrity. Each patch is then refined by a pretrained SynthMorph network in an unsupervised manner, enabling dense and flexible alignment without task-specific training. Finally, a fusion strategy integrates both global and local deformations into a smooth, unified deformation field. Extensive quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rigid, classical non-rigid, and learning-based methods in accuracy, structural consistency, and deformation smoothness on the challenging sonar dataset.",

First, we show that the Kolmogorov scale $\\eta \\sim (\\nu^3/\\epsilon)^{1/4}$ is not merely a dimensional necessity but a geometric diffusion horizon: it is the scale at which the kinetic energy of a fractal trajectory, scaling as $k \\sim \\nu/\\tau$, balances the macroscopic dissipation rate. Second, we show that the universal law of the wall is the stationary solution to this stochastic process under no-slip constraints. The logarithmic mean profile arises from the scale invariance of the turbulent diffusivity, while finite-Reynolds-number corrections emerge as controlled asymptotic expansions of the stochastic variance. This framework offers a first-principles derivation of turbulent scaling laws without recourse to phenomenological dimensional analysis.",

The path algebra allows for concatenation of transitions which affords the calculation of cascade probabilities. We extend the path algebra to allow for the multiplication of non-composable paths, i.e., transition that don't directly share a level connecting them. We define the coincidence algebra as the algebra that allows for such an extension and realize it as the fibres for a coincidence algebra bundle, the base space of which is the path algebra where decay schemes live.

    "abstract": "Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.",

    "title": "High schoolers excel at Oxford quantum course using pictorial mathematics",
    "abstract": "We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.",

    "abstract": "Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.",

Our design exploits nonlinear resonant scattering of spin waves propagating in a YIG medium from an edge mode of a permalloy nano-element. The reduced frequency and volume of the edge mode facilitate matching it to the YIG modes and give rise to their wide-angle scattering. As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions. We show that the scattered waves are strong enough to activate secondary neurons. This provides the connectivity required for combining our proposed neurons into 2D magnonic neural networks.",

The research implements and compares multiple detection methodologies, including classical approaches (thermal/WMO and dynamical/1.5 PVU criteria) alongside novel hybrid techniques combining stability and humidity parameters originally developed by ECMWF. Through systematic validation against January 2010 monthly means and a detailed case study of the October 2024 DANA (Depression Aislada en Niveles Altos) event, this work demonstrates the superior performance of hybrid approaches in capturing tropopause dynamics. The development of an automated Python-based comparison tool enabled a quantitative evaluation against Water Vapor 6.2 {\\mu}m satellite imagery, revealing that the hybrid method achieved the highest structural similarity (mean SSIM: 0.5327) and the most consistent performance across the studied meteorological conditions. The findings highlight the critical role of accurate tropopause detection in improving forecasting capabilities for extreme weather events, particularly in topographically complex regions like Southeast Morocco. This research contributes both methodological advancements in tropopause identification and practical insights for operational meteorology, providing a foundation for enhanced early warning systems and improved understanding of atmospheric processes governing high-impact weather phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Micro-Electro-Mechanical, so called 'MEMs,' vapor cells are a key component in atom-based quantum sensors, such as clocks, gyroscopes, electric field sensors and magnetometers. MEMs vapor cell fabrication for Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors is particularly demanding. The Rydberg states used for the sensor can shift in a constant electric field which can be generated by the internal surfaces of the vapor cell cavity. The ratio of the detection wavelength to vapor cell size can span a large range, meaning that the radio frequency field-vapor cell interaction is a critical design consideration. In many radio frequency sensing cases, there is a desire to minimize the interaction between the vapor cell and the target radio frequency field, as well as assure that every vapor cell behaves uniformly. These criterion favor MEMs vapor cells with low background electric fields. Known inert, organic coatings cannot survive the bonding temperatures required for conventional anodic bonding of a MEMs vapor cell. Applying inert, organic coatings to the internal cavities of MEMs vapor cells is a longstanding challenge. In this paper, we present a low temperature bonding scheme that is compatible with coating the internal cavity of a MEMs vapor cell with Octadecyltrichlorosilane (CH$_3\\,$(CH$_2$)$_{17}\\,$SiCl$_3$, OTS). The coating prevents the Cs used in the vapor cell from sticking to the walls. Spectral linewidths of $\\sim300\\,$kHz are obtained using Rydberg spectroscopy, with energy shifts corresponding to electric fields $<$10$\\,$mV$\\,$cm$^{-1}$.",

For each neighborhood, we compute the average \\emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\\phi \\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.",

    "title": "An Interpretable Operator-Learning Model for Electric Field Profile Reconstruction in Discharges Based on the EFISH Method",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models have recently been used to reconstruct electric field distributions from EFISH signal profiles-the 'inverse EFISH problem'. This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.",

We surveyed 6,114 highly educated and scientifically engaged individuals (77.60% bachelor's degree+; 67.99% high-to-very-high scientific engagement) to assess their beliefs about extraterrestrial intelligent life existence: (1) personal beliefs, (2) perceived social circle beliefs, (3) perceived expert beliefs, and (4) responses to expert consensus revelation. Results showed 95.01% believed extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, with 62.59% holding definitive rather than probable convictions. Participants exhibited massive pluralistic ignorance, a 'cosmic closet', underestimating social circle beliefs by 46.07 percentage points despite near-universal personal conviction. Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14). These findings demonstrate that consensus misperception operates along two dimensions, prevalence and intensity, and that even scientifically engaged audiences resist belief revision via expert consensus information.",

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.",

Both photonic neuromorphic chips based on the MZI mesh and DFB-SA array were designed, optimized and fabricated.

We demonstrated an end-to-end inference of an entire layer of the lightweight photonic SNN. The hardware-software collaborative inference accuracy is 90% and 80.5% for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The energy efficiency is 1.39 TOPS/W for the MZI mesh, and is 987.65 GOPS/W for the DFB-SA array.

Instead, alongside the expected multipole image, the resulting image configuration also includes lower-order multipole contributions.

While the ELMs are an intrinsic feature of H-mode operation in Tokamaks, runaway electrons pose a potential threat across all Tokamak device this http URL devices such as ITER, even with mitigation strategies, the ELMs can still impose considerable heat loads on the PFMs, reaching levels of approximately 1 MJ/m2.

Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the REs populations generated by plasma instabilities within the Damavand Tokamak discharges exhibit heat densities on the order of MJ/m2 to 1 cm2 area PFMs. Furthermore, considering an average REs energy of 1 MeV and the prevailing discharge current, calculations indicate that the average total energy of the REs population per discharge is approximately 1 kJ, which is subsequently deposited on the Tokamak limiter. Considering the limiter's surface area and assuming that only 40% of the REs energy is transferred to it, the calculated heat load density reaches the order of MJ/m2, comparable to that observed during the ELMs events in large-scale fusion devices.

They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. \"Science anxiety\" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled \"The Movements of the Universe\", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.",

    "title": "Large/small eddy simulations: A posteriori analysis in high Reynolds number isotropic turbulence",
    "abstract": "While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.",

    "abstract": "AlGaAs/GaAs coatings are being considered as coating candidates for gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper we investigate the birefringence properties of this crystalline semiconductor material by modulating the optical illumination on the mirror coating and monitoring the induced birefringence. While the measured low-frequency birefringence values align with previous studies, we observed a frequency-dependent behavior in the illumination-to-birefringence coupling, characterized by a pole increasing with illumination intensity and a DC gain decreasing with illumination intensity. We developed a theoretical mode based on a master equation to characterize the measurement results by considering photon-induced electric fields and electro-optical effects. This model reproduces the frequency and intensity dependencies of the induced birefringence. Additionally, this model predicts a generation-recombination noise (GR noise) will be observable in the coatings birefringence. While the presented measurement cannot predict the exact level of GR noise, for the frequency band and spot sizes relevant for gravitational-wave detectors we expect GR noise to be white below the pole frequency, scale with power the same way laser shot noise does, and for fixed power be independent of spot size.",

    "abstract": "Erbium-based materials have long been recognized for their important telecom-band applications, yet their widespread adoption in integrated optoelectronics has been hindered by two fundamental limitations: the difficulty in achieving high erbium density without concentration quenching which leads to small optical gain in doped materials, and the difficulty in fabricating a practical device with single crystal nanowires that demonstrated high optical gain previously1,2. Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 {\\mu}W with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.",

    "abstract": "Topological dislocations in otherwise periodic lattices represent global structural defects that, nevertheless, typically leave the lattice periodicity intact far from the dislocation. Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created.",

The Kolkata index (which corresponds to a fixed point of the complementary Lorenz function $L_c(x) \\equiv 1-L(x)$) gives the fraction of wealth $k$ possessed by the richest $ 1-k$ fraction of people ($k$ = 0.8 corresponds to Pareto's 80-20 law from 1896). We show rigorously that the Pietra or Robin Hood index $p$ should equal to the excess wealth $2k-1$ possessed by the richest $1-k$ people. Our numerical data analysis for US IRS Income data (1983-2022), Bollywood (India) movie income data (1999-2024) and the citation inequalities across the publications by forty Nobel Laureates (2020-2025) in Economics, Physics, Chemistry and Medicine clearly shows that $p/(2k -1)$ is always greater than unity but the deviation is never more than five percent. Assuming some simple analytic form for the Lorenz function, we also derived the relations $k = (1/2) + (3/8)g$ for small $g$ values and $p/g = 3/4$. However, these relations generally deviate significantly for larger $g$ or $k$ values when compared with observations.",

Using the noncollinear Alexander-Anderson model, we have shown that the interaction of localized magnetic moments formed by itinerant electrons strongly depends on the position of the d-level relative to the Fermi level, which determines the number of localized electrons. Depending on this parameter, the ground state of the magnetic dimer can be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or noncollinear without the effects of spin-orbit interaction. The magnetic state can be controlled by shifting the d-level with an electric field, even without current flow. For a sufficiently large value of the hopping parameter between localized states there can be several self-consistent solutions with different values of magnetic moments. This opens new possibilities for manipulation of the magnetic structure of nanosystems. The results obtained lead to a new interpretation of the mechanisms of magnetization reversal, recording, and deleting of magnetic structures in tunneling spectroscopy experiments.",

Here, we break this status quo by demonstrating the first monolithic photonic chip-based reconfigurable radar compound jamming signal generator. Implemented on a compact 25 mm2 silicon photonic footprint, our system features high integration and electrical reconfigurability, supporting agile switching among four distinct jamming modes. Crucially, we introduce a composite jamming mechanism that exploits time-frequency coupling to break the inherent symmetry of traditional deceptive jamming, generating controllable asymmetric false-target clusters. The on-chip system exhibits an operating bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz and is capable of generating over 20 high-fidelity false targets simultaneously. This work establishes a fully functional platform combining broad bandwidth, multi-mode flexibility, and asymmetric deception, paving the way for miniaturized, intelligent photonic solutions in next-generation electronic warfare.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the diffusion source in complex networks is critical for understanding and controlling epidemic spread. In realistic settings, full observation of node states is rarely available, making sensor-based source detection a practical alternative. However, existing sensor-based methods are often confined to simple networks, failing to capture the higher-order group dynamics of real-world spreading process. By deploying a limited number of sensors to monitor the diffusion process, one can infer the origin from partial observations. Yet, determining optimal sensor placement is challenging, i.e., poor deployment leads to redundant or noisy data, while optimal placement must balance coverage diversity and information value under limited resources. To address these challenges, we propose a dedicated framework termed Sensor-based Source Detection in Hypergraphs (SSDH). Specifically, we introduce a novel entropy-driven sensor deployment strategy that effectively captures critical early-stage diffusion signals by maximizing information gain under limited resources. Furthermore, we develop a source localization algorithm that quantifies propagation uncertainty through a newly defined path uncertainty-based score. By integrating this score with topological distance, SSDH enables accurate and robust source identification. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and empirical hypergraphs demonstrate that SSDH consistently outperforms competing algorithms by 5%--30% across different sensor ratios, final spreading ratios, and infection probabilities. These results validate the effectiveness of SSDH and highlight its superior capability to tackle source localization in complex systems characterized by higher-order interactions.",

One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\\hat{P} \\sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model.

A single semantic query is expressed once and evaluated against both knowledge bases, returning the locally correct PVs. The ontology thereby enables not only portable workflows but also interoperable data, since measurements and catalogs are annotated with shared semantics rather than facility-specific names.

A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna.

A rectifier operating at 2.45 and 5.8 GHz was designed, fabricated, and measured for validation. The measurements show maximum RF-dc conversion efficiencies of 74.9% and 61.9% with 200 and 500{\\Omega} loads at 2.45 and 5.8 GHz, respectively. The proposed rectifier achieves dual-band harmonic control with high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of freeform optical surfaces raises the demand for optical design tools developed for generalized systems. In the design process surface-by-surface aberration contributions are of special interest. The expansion of the wave aberration function into field and pupil dependent coefficients is an analytical method used for that purpose. An alternative numerical approach utilizing data from the trace of multiple ray sets is proposed. The optical system is divided into segments of the optical path measured along the chief ray. Each segment covers one surface and the distance to the subsequent surface. Surface contributions represent the change of the wavefront that occurs due to propagation through individual segments. Further, the surface contributions are divided with respect to their phenomenological origin into intrinsic, induced and transfer components. Each component is determined from a separate set of rays. The proposed method does not place any constraints on the system geometry or the aperture shape. However, here we concentrate on near-circular apertures and specify the resulting wavefront error maps using an expansion into Zernike polynomials. Hence, for the first time additive surface Zernike contributions are obtained.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we develop computational models and methodology for accurate multi-component-flow simulation in under-resolved multi-scale porous structures. It is generally impractical to fully resolve the flow in porous structures with large length-scale difference due to tremendously high computational expense. The flow contributions from under-resolved scales need to be accounted for with proper physics modeling as well as simulation processes. Using pre-computed physical properties such as the absolute permeability, K0, the capillary-pressure-saturation curve, and the relative permeability, Kr, in typically resolved porous structures, local fluid force is conjectured and applied to simulation in the under-resolved regions that are represented by porous media. By doing so, accurate simulation of flow in multi-scale porous structures becomes feasible. In order to check the accuracy and robustness of this method, a set of benchmark test cases are performed for both single-component and multi-component flows in artificially constructed multi-scale porous structures, and simulation results are compared with analytic solutions and/or results with much finer resolution resolving the porous structures. Quantitatively consistent results are obtained with proper input of K0, capillary pressure, and Kr in all tested cases. Specifically, imbibition patterns, entry pressure, residual component patterns, and the absolute and relative permeability are accurately captured with this approach.",

However, translating these insights into clinical practice may require computationally efficient approaches such as Reduced Order Model (ROM) or Machine Learning (ML). In this work, we developed an ML-ROM framework to predict critical, restenosis-prone, haemodynamic regions accounting for both vessel geometries and inlet flow waveforms. We generated 500 synthetic femoral-artery geometries parameterised by six geometric parameters, and created physiologically realistic inflow waveforms via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of patient data. CFD was used to obtain the Wall Shear Stress (WSS) distribution, from which TAWSS and OSI were computed. Critical regions were then defined by applying threshold-based criteria to the TAWSS and OSI. Four critical-region definitions were considered: two with vessel-specific relative thresholds (TAWSS< 33rd percentile and OSI> 66nd percentile) and two with absolute thresholds (TAWSS< 0.5 Pa and OSI> 0.2). Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was then applied to these high-dimensional critical-region data to obtain ROMs; These were then used to train ML models from which the critical region regions could be reconstructed. Three ML architectures were explored: a Fourier-based architecture, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The Fourier models achieved the highest performance, with the median values of Balanced Accuracy (BA) exceeding 0.92 across all critical-region definitions. The ML-ROM framework also offered a substantial speed-up ratio, about nine orders of magnitude faster than traditional CFD.",

    "abstract": "Multiphase flows with high density ratios, such as water and air flows, have recently been simulated using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. This approach corresponds to solving the phase field equations, such as the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, and the hydrodynamic equations, typically the Navier-Stokes and pressure equations for pseudo-incompressible fluids. Due to the high density ratio, the higher-order numerical truncation errors associated with spatial density gradients can become significant. These errors can lead to problems such as inaccuracies in shear stress, violations of Galilean invariance, and undesirable dependencies on absolute pressure for the pseudo-incompressible solutions. To overcome such problems, the moments of the distribution function and the equilibrium state must be carefully designed while ensuring robustness. In this work, we propose a new scheme based on the lattice kinetic scheme (LKS), which directly solves the velocity and pressure fields in the similar discrete space as the LB method. When mapping the LKS-based models to the LB models, the original LKS models are simplified for computational efficiency and the filter collision operator is implemented. Benchmark test cases confirm that the proposed scheme effectively addresses these issues, achieving high accuracy and robustness while eliminating the iterative steps typically required in the LKS. One of the most significant improvements is the accuracy of the airflow field induced by water motion, likely due to improved momentum transfer across the interface.",

Its ability to accurately handle high density ratio and surface tension effects is expected to be beneficial for capillary flow simulation, leading to accurate reproduction of flow patterns such as slug flow, droplet flow, and film flow. This is critical in many engineering cases because the flow patterns significantly affect the velocity and pressure fields. In this study, on top of the LB models based on the conservative Allen-Cahn equation and the volumetric boundary conditions for the complex geometries, an optimized wettability and friction model are implemented. With these models, we conducted a set of benchmark test cases, including static and dynamic multiphase flow scenarios such as the droplet on the curved surfaces, water-filling channel for the Lucas-Washburn law, and the critical pressure in the three-dimensional channel, an air-driven multiphase flow in the experiments. In all of these cases, the solver produces results that are consistent with both theory and experiment, even with respect to the pressure field accuracy, which has often been overlooked in many previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Growing interest in decarbonization and Arctic accessibility has renewed attention on Europe-Asia shipping corridors. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) is often portrayed as a 30-40% shortcut relative to Suez, with savings propagated to time, fuel, and CO2. The effect of enforcing sea-only feasibility on these baselines, and its downstream impact on time, fuel, and CO2, remains under-examined. We compare great-circle baselines with sea-only routes computed via A-star search (A*) on a 0.5-degree grid between Northern Europe and Northeast Asia across the Suez, Cape of Good Hope, and NSR corridors under three waypoint philosophies. Distances are mapped to voyage time using corridor-typical speeds and to fuel/CO2 using main- and auxiliary-engine accounting. Sea-only routing preserves the ranking NSR < Suez < Cape but compresses NSR's advantage once realistic speeds are applied. NSR remains shortest (about 8000-10000 nm versus 11000-12000 nm for Suez), yet typical durations differ modestly and fuel/CO2 savings over Suez are small and variant-dependent. Equal-speed tests restore geometric ordering, and endpoint sensitivity shows larger NSR gains for more northern East Asian ports. The framework provides a reproducible, corridor-agnostic benchmark for later integration of sea ice, weather, regulatory overlays, and AIS data in dynamic Arctic voyage planning.",

More recent LiDAR data and observational reports have indicated that the historical highest point on the mountain, Columbia Crest, has lost a significant amount of elevation and may no longer be the highest point. This report documents the results of multiple ground surveys conducted in August and September 2024 to determine the current elevation of Columbia Crest and the current elevation and location of the summit of Mt Rainier. On August 28, 2024, a Promark 220 differential GPS unit was used to measure the elevation of Columbia Crest and the Southwest Rim, two recognized historical local maxima on the rim of the summit caldera. Columbia Crest is a year-round ice-capped locality, while the Southwest Rim melts to rock each summer. Measurements were corroborated with Abney level measurements and LiDAR data from 2007 and 2022. On September 21 and 22, 2024, additional ground measurements were taken with the Promark 220 of the Summit 2 USGS monument location and of the highest rock on the Southwest Rim. Additionally, the three USGS monuments lower on the mountain (Muir, McClure, and Paradise) were measured. These measurements were used to corroborate the summit measurements. Monument measurements were found to be consistent with 2010 measurements. Southwest Rim summit measurements were consistent from August and September. Columbia Crest, last measured at 14,411.0ft (NGVD29) in 1998, was measured to have lost 21.8ft of elevation. Now the ice-capped Columbia Crest is no longer the summit of Mt Rainier. The summit is now on the seasonally rocky Southwest Rim, next to the Summit 2 USGS monument location. (The physical monument was not located and has likely been stolen). The new summit elevation of Mount Rainier is 14,399.6ft +/-0.1ft NGVD29 (14,406.2ft +/-0.1ft NAVD88).",

    "abstract": "The analogy between free-electron lasers (FELs) - laboratory devices which generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies - and whistler wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere has recently been extended to account for waves with spatially dependent amplitudes and a spectrum of frequencies. The whistler was found to be governed by one of the most well-studied nonlinear equations in physics, the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), which can be used to predict the complex nonlinear physics of multi-mode interactions. In this study, we focus on the single-mode solutions of the GLE and investigate their propagation and stability in the context of magnetospheric chorus. As with FELs, there are two types of instabilities, the Benjamin-Feir instability, where all single modes are unstable, and the Eckhaus instability, where there is a band of stable modes, but all modes outside of the band are unstable. Both stability conditions are given by well known inequalities in the GLE literature. For whistler-mode chorus, we analytically reduce the inequalities to simple expressions and show that, to the extent that the GLE represents magnetospheric chorus, it is Benjamin-Feir stable. We also derive the width of the Eckhaus stability band. We find that the predicted bandwidth is consistent with in situ satellite observations and support our analytical calculations with numerical simulations of the GLE. Our simulations demonstrate the robustness of the stable modes, the evolution from unstable modes to stable ones, and the tendency for mode condensation, whereby a noisy spectrum of modes tends to relax to a single stable mode.",

By analyzing the ideal Jones fields that realize a target pattern, we identify that the fundamental degrees of freedom are the relative phases of the individual tweezers, rather than the full spatial phase profile. Leveraging this insight, we formulate a reverse projection optimization that adjusts only a small set of phase parameters to approximate the ideal operator within the physical constraints of a metasurface. This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface. A key advantage of our method is its phase stability, yielding strong resistance to optical aberrations and enabling coherent global phase modulation such as forming vortex tweezer lattice, without degrading trap quality.

However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies.",

Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.",

    "abstract": "We propose a time series analysis framework focused on higher-order temporal correlations in the event sequence beyond the interevent time distribution by employing the burst-tree decomposition method. Bursts are clustered events that rapidly occur within shorter time periods, and they are separated by relatively longer inactive periods. The burst-tree decomposition method exactly maps the event sequence onto a tree, called a burst tree, in which each internal node represents a merge of consecutive bursts at the timescale separating those bursts. The burst tree fully reveals the hierarchical structure of bursts, hence the higher-order temporal correlations for the entire range of timescales. Those correlations are quantified using novel and existing measures derived from the burst tree, such as the burst complexity, memory coefficient for bursts, and principal and secondary cross sections of the burst-merging kernel. We apply our framework to the heartbeat time series of healthy people and of those with heart disease to reveal distinct multiscale temporal properties in physiological time series.",

    "abstract": "The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.",

    "abstract": "The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, including the treatment of the scale-determining equations under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$\\omega$ model for Rayleigh--Bénard convection in a horizontally infinite plane layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($\\mathit{Ra}$), Prandtl ($\\mathit{Pr}$), and Nusselt ($\\mathit{Nu}$) numbers that capture the trends observed in numerical simulations: $\\mathit{Nu} \\sim \\mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\\mathit{Pr}^{1/3}$ for $\\mathit{Pr} \\ll 1$ and $\\mathit{Nu} \\sim \\mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\\mathit{Pr}^{-0.415}$ for $\\mathit{Pr} \\gg 1$. Although this analytical framework provides a consistent reference for understanding how buoyancy enters the $k$--$\\omega$ closure, the predicted $\\mathit{Nu}$ scaling differs from experimental measurements. The buoyancy-related modelling terms are therefore reformulated to reproduce observed heat-transport trends across wide $\\mathit{Ra}$ and $\\mathit{Pr}$ ranges. By introducing only two additional dimensionless algebraic functions and recovering the original formulation when buoyancy is absent, the resulting corrections retain full compatibility with the standard $k$--$\\omega$ framework. The revised closures are validated across a range of configurations, including one- and two-dimensional Rayleigh--Bénard convection, internally heated convection, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, the corrected formulation yields substantially improved quantitative accuracy.",

    "abstract": "A spectroscopic study of a plasma deflagration accelerator was carried out to investigate the temporal evolution of plasma density within the pinch region. A half-meter imaging monochromator, paired with a fast (10 MHz) camera operating at 1 MHz, was used to collect broadened chord-integrated spectral lines from the pinch region of a plasma deflagration device. Specifically, images of the $H_{\\beta}$ and the $H_{\\alpha}$ lines were taken - with the $H_{\\alpha}$ used to find the background continuum. Voigt fits of the Abel inverted H$_{\\beta}$ emission lines allowed for determination of the radial profile of the number density in the pinch at intervals of 1 $\\mu$s. This provided insight into the formation, growth, and decay of the pinch in both the deflagration and detonation modes of the accelerator. It was found that the maximum density for the deflagration increased from $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$ 1.4 cm away from the core of the pinch to $\\sim 10^{23}$ m$^{-3}$ at the core of the deflagration pinch. In contrast, the detonation pinch featured a broader zone of relatively constant density on the order of $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. Furthermore, an energy balance of the plasma in the deflagration pinch and downstream, as informed by prior work, was done to get an estimate of temperatures in the core of the pinch where measurements are not currently possible revealing potential temperatures on the 550 eV in the core of the pinch suggesting departures from some of the assumptions in the analysis.",

However, their low radiative rates and poor charge transport properties remain key challenges for efficient device integration. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of dual-emissive Eu3+ - Yb3+ coordination compounds that exhibit temperature-dependent luminescence intensity ratios (LIR) between the visible and near-infrared regions. These materials enable simultaneous optical thermometry and electroluminescence, with LIR values showing excellent agreement with external thermocouple measurements over a broad temperature range. OLED devices incorporating these complexes demonstrate stable operation, and their luminescence properties are further enhanced by integration with engineered plasmonic metasurfaces. This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity. Our findings highlight the promise of lanthanide-based coordination compounds as multifunctional emitters for next-generation optoelectronic devices and suggest new pathways toward intelligent OLED architectures with integrated sensing and directional control.",

We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods.",

In this work, we introduce a computationally efficient three-dimensional real-space tight-binding model specifically designed for the simulation of HHG in confined systems.

Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures the observed dependency of the HHG yield on the quantum dot size. Additionally, we simulate the HHG yield for elliptically polarized pulses for different QD-sizes and driving wavelengths up to $5\\,\\mu{\\mathrm{m}}$.

    "abstract": "Acoustic helical dichroism (HD) arises from the interaction between vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and chiral media, yet such chiral sound-matter interactions are typically weak. Here, we employ quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in acoustic meta-cavities composed of coupled Helmholtz resonators to enhance acoustic HD. We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators. The findings open new avenues for achieving strong chiral sound-matter interactions, with potential applications in acoustic chiral sensing and acoustic OAM manipulation.",

This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.",

In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 °C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films.

    "abstract": "Mountains represent a crucial natural resource for many regions worldwide, particularly in Mediterranean areas such as the Iberian Peninsula, where climate change can have profound consequences. However, due to their coarse resolution, traditional climate models cannot properly represent the complexity of orographic processes. Storm-resolving models, with horizontal resolutions finer than 10 km, offer a path forward to provide high-quality information for local adaptation even in complex terrain. In this work, we assess the performance of one such model, the IFS-FESOM developed within the EU-NextGEMS project, in simulating the historical seasonal snow cover in the main Iberian mountain ranges and projecting climate change effects. It is evaluated against four high-resolution reanalysis-based products, satellite, and in situ observations. Despite a positive bias in the length of the snow cover season and the number of snowfall days, the model can represent features of the snow climatology, such as its elevation dependency, seasonal cycle, and mean covered area, successfully within the range of uncertainty of the reference data. In addition, the projection under the SSP3-7.0 scenario shows a marked reduction of the snow season across almost all of Iberia, with low- to mid-elevations and the southernmost ranges showing the greatest reductions. These changes are linked to reduced snowfall days, caused primarily by rising temperatures but also by decreasing precipitation, particularly in southern and Mediterranean sectors. Our results suggest that storm-resolving simulations can provide local climate projections of snow information in complex terrain without regional downscaling.",

    "abstract": "Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.",

Critically, the thermal reliability of these materials was evaluated under repeated solid-liquid cycling up to 100 cycles in oxidizing atmospheres, revealing their stability and degradation profiles. Additionally, dilatometry and density analysis were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the alloys and practical properties for end users. Among the tested alloys, several demonstrated high volumetric energy densities (over 500 kWh/m${}^3$ for a temperature difference of 300{\\textdegree}C) and good thermal durability, establishing Al-Cu-Si alloys as promising PCM candidates for industrial-scale high-temperature energy storage applications. This study fills a notable gap in the literature by combining phase selection, comprehensive thermophysical property evaluation, and long-term cycling analysis above 600{\\textdegree}C.",

    "abstract": "A compact and broadband polarimetric imaging platform is presented, based on second-harmonic generation (SHG) in nonlinear flat-optics. The system employs periodic all-dielectric AlGaAs gratings to induce polarization-dependent SH emission, enabling pixel by pixel direct retrieval of the full Stokes vector from an input intensity distribution in the near-infrared range. By engineering the geometry and orientation of the polarimetric units, sensitivity to linear and circular polarization components is achieved. A superpixel design comprising four polarimetric structures allows accurate reconstruction of the polarization state without moving parts or sequential measurements. This approach offers a scalable, passive, and cost-effective solution for polarimetric imaging, particularly suited for near-infrared applications.",

    "abstract": "Many complex physical systems admit natural decomposition into an exactly solvable component and a perturbative correction. Rather than training neural networks to learn complete trajectories from scratch, we introduce Neural Network Perturbation Theory (NNPT), where networks predict only residual perturbations after analytically subtracting known exact solutions. We validate this framework through systematic comparison: using identical 2x32 architectures, correction learning achieves 28-54x lower validation error compared to networks trained on complete trajectories. Using the gravitational three-body problem as a test bed, we investigate capacity transitions in fixed-architecture multilayer perceptrons as Jovian mass varies from 0.05 to 30 times its physical value. An equalized-accuracy protocol reveals that both minimal network capacity and training time exhibit sharp transitions at f_c = 15.6+-1.0, where the system enters a strongly chaotic regime. At this transition, minimal capacity jumps approximately sevenfold from ~1,200 to ~8,600 parameters (architectures 2x32 and 3x64). Preliminary exploration of sequential two-stage corrections suggests that first-stage networks already capture dominant perturbative features. Our symplectic integrator maintains relative energy conservation below 2x10^-7 throughout, confirming that transitions reflect physical complexity rather than numerical error. Our results establish correction learning as a general strategy for parameter-efficient surrogates and demonstrate that physical complexity imposes fundamental capacity barriers on fixed-architecture networks at chaos onset.",

    "abstract": "Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.",

    "abstract": "Mapping methods, including the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping and spin-mapping, are commonly utilised to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics by propagating classical mapping variable trajectories. Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations.",

    "title": "Effects of Turbulent Energy Exchange between Electrons and Ions on Global Temperature Profiles",
    "abstract": "Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.",

The instrument utilizes two interband cascade lasers operating at 2.78 $\\mu$m and 3.24 $\\mu$m within a novel four-pass M-shaped optical cell, which provides high signal power and long-term field operation without requiring active air sampling. Two detection techniques $-$ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a simplified wavelength modulation spectroscopy (sWMS) $-$ were implemented and evaluated. Laboratory calibration demonstrated linear responses for all gases (R$^2$ $\\approx$ 0.999) and detection precisions at 10 Hz of 311 ppb for CO$_2$, 8.87 ppb for CH$_4$, and 788 ppb for H$_2$O. Field tests conducted at a grassland site near Moscow showed strong correlations (R = 0.91 for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, R = 0.67 for CH$_4$) with commercial LI-COR LI-7200 and LI-7700 analyzers. The TDLAS mode demonstrated lower noise and greater stability under outdoor conditions, while sWMS provided baseline-free spectra but was more sensitive to power fluctuations. E-CAHORS combines high precision, multi-species sensing capability with low power consumption (10 W) and a compact design (4.2 kg).",

    "abstract": "The temperature-dependence of dynamical properties (e.g., the asymptotic diffusion coefficient and the sub-diffusive exponent) are calculated for charges and excitons in one-dimensional systems subject to static and dynamic disorder. These properties are determined by three complementary methods. One approach is via the time-integration of the velocity autocorrelation function. The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature.",

    "abstract": "Light can carry a spin angular momentum, an intrinsic and extrinsic orbital angular momentum, associated with a circular polarization, optical vortex beams, and varying beam trajectories, respectively. The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity.",

    "abstract": "In simulations for modern free-electron laser (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.",

We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations.

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce an optimization-free approach for the automated generation of self-organized freeform waveguides that adapt to complex propagation paths. Our method relies on local reaction-diffusion dynamics to produce robust, spatially distributed structures. In contrast to conventional waveguides based on periodic media, which impose strong geometric constraints and require extensive fine-tuning, the proposed structures support nontrivial geometries while maintaining photonic band gap behavior. We experimentally demonstrate that these self-organized waveguides achieve superior transmission efficiency along complex paths. This optimization-free strategy enables the automated design of advanced electromagnetic components with intrinsic adaptability and resilience.",

    "abstract": "Plasmonics enables the miniaturization of photonic devices beyond the optical diffraction limit,yet its potential is hindered by inherently large ohmic losses. Hence, it is prudent to explore low loss alternatives to the current mainstay of plasmonics-the noble metals. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of potassium as a plasmonic material with intrinsically low losses in the optical region. The ultraflat, high quality potassium film, fabricated via a rapid slipping-assisted oxide-free crystallization process, achieves an experimentally observed optical damping rate of 3.7 meV,with a measured imaginary permittivity of approximately 0.1 across the entire visible to near-infrared range (400-2000 nm). Near field optical spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the reduced losses by revealing deeply subwavelength confinement of optical modes. This result enhances our understanding of the factors governing plasmonic materials and devices and establishes a new platform for exploring extreme light-matter interactions in a variety of plasmonic systems.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying frictional properties of interfaces remains a major challenge in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial geomechanics, where available samples, laboratory apparatuses, and geophysical observations are inherently limited. We introduce an analytic and numerical framework, grounded in nonlinear control theory, to infer the emergent frictional behavior of seismic faults. From noisy slip measurements, we first reconstruct the slip rate and frictional response in finite time using a Robust Exact Filtering Differentiator (REFD) that attenuates measurement noise. Building on these reconstructions, we design an exponentially convergent adaptive-gain observer that estimates the internal state variable and the key parameters (a - b) and dc of the rate-and-state friction (RSF) law, widely used in fault mechanics. Numerical experiments show that, in fast slip regimes where data are sufficiently rich, the method recovers RSF parameters with errors on the order of 20% and accurately tracks the RSF state variable despite noise contamination, whereas slowly varying sliding periods lack the observability required for reliable estimation. We also establish observability and identifiability conditions for the extended system, enabling the determination of additional parameters and outlining pathways for more advanced control-theoretic approaches to friction and state identification in fault systems. Although we apply the approach to a reduced spring-slider analogue, it improves on classical RSF calibration methods that depend on laboratory access to shear and normal stress. It also offers convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds, and it can further support model-based inversions that embed RSF in forward simulations.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.",

There are thus two equivalent configurations with equal energy separated by a potential-energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings.",

When applied to isotropic media, the results are verified to be consistent with those obtained using an optical (Gordon) metric.

The radially polarized f/10 case injects approximately one-third more charge than the linearly polarized case, while the f/5 radially polarized case outperforms the linearly polarized one by about a factor of two in terms of maximum electron energy.

By association, systematic inaccuracies in any buoy data are equally important, and thus when two buoy types provide systematically inconsistent information, this is a concern for anyone using an ocean wave model. This report is concerned with the accuracy of the high frequency portion of the ocean wave spectrum commonly observable by buoys, roughly 0.2 to 0.6 Hz. We evaluate four buoy types (two moored, two drifting) using two quantitative measures. The first involves comparing each type with a co-located ocean wave model. The second method involves evaluation of high frequency energy level as a function of wind speed. Both evaluation methods suggest that the Datawell Waverider (DWR) buoys have a strong tendency to report higher energy levels than the other three buoy types. We evaluate high frequency energy level using three different metrics (mean square slope, energy in a band of high frequencies, and spectral density at a single, specific band, 0.4 Hz), and the conclusions are found to be insensitive to the parameter used.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates ion kinetic effects during the parametric decay instability (PDI) of parallel-propagating Alfvén waves under plasma conditions characteristic of the Earth's ionosphere. By using a series of hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the evolution of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in ultra-low-beta plasmas. Our numerical campaign systematically explores the dependence on key parameters (plasma beta, pump-wave amplitude and polarization, and ion composition). To emphasize the role of kinetic effects, we choose to trigger the PDI with a dispersive mother wave with wavelength comparable to the ion characteristic inertial length. Our results reveal pronounced nonthermal VDF modifications, including parallel heating and the formation of secondary ion beams, linked to the nonlinear evolution of parametric decay instability. By varying the plasma beta and the pump-wave amplitude, we identify a critical regime where rapid and complete broadening of the velocity distribution function is observed, triggering bidirectional ion acceleration. Notably, simulations modeling realistic ionospheric conditions demonstrate that even low-amplitude Alfvénic perturbations can induce significant VDF spreading and ion beam generation, with hydrogen ions exhibiting stronger effects than oxygen. These nonthermal microscopic processes offer a plausible mechanism for particle precipitation in space weather events. This work represents the first comprehensive study with hybrid simulations of PDI-driven ion kinetics in ultra-low-beta plasmas, providing quantitative estimates for the time delay between electromagnetic wave impact and ion VDF modification and new insights into wave-particle interactions that may contribute to ion acceleration, precipitation processes and space plasma dynamics.",

To help identify the optimal CYGNO detector configuration, we performed a detailed characterization of two state-of-the-art scientific CMOS sensors, focusing on dark-signal behavior across different exposure times and on detection sensitivity, assessed using the well-defined X-ray emissions from a 55Fe source, which reproduce the low-light conditions expected in CYGNO. CYGNO currently employs a very low-noise Hamamatsu sensor, the ORCA-Fusion, for testing and validation of its detection system. Hamamatsu has recently introduced two new sensors that may be of interest for future upgrades. The first is an improved version of the current model, the ORCA-Fusion-BT, featuring a back-illuminated design that reaches a quantum efficiency of up to 95% at 550 nm. The second is a next-generation sensor, the ORCA-Quest. Although its peak quantum efficiency is not as high as that of the Fusion-BT, it offers high sensitivity over a broader spectral range, extending into the ultraviolet region, and provides ultra-low readout noise of 0.27 electrons, about 2.6 times lower than that of the Fusion family. These two sensors therefore represent a significant opportunity to enhance the performance of scientific experiments, including those conducted by the CYGNO collaboration. This document presents a comprehensive characterization of these sensors to evaluate their relevance for experiments operating in photon-limited environments and their suitability for integration into the CYGNO detector system.",

    "abstract": "We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.",

This quantifies the recoil's outcome without revealing its physical origin or the underlying forces that produce it. The recoil force and torque exist even in the absence of external illumination, such that an isolated dipole emitter can experience them. In contrast to the other terms, the recoil terms are odd under time reversal. To clarify their nature and properties, we re-derive the recoil force from first principles using the total Lorentz force on a system of charges that form a simultaneous electric and magnetic dipole. The results agree with the standard momentum-based derivation and reveal their ultimate origin from retardation effects -- arising from the finite speed of light -- in the mutual interactions between charges. This result provides fundamental insight into the recoil mechanism, offering a clearer conceptual foundation for future theoretical and experimental studies of light-induced forces.",

We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Voronoi tessellations are standard in spatial planning for assigning service areas based on Euclidean proximity, underpinning regulatory frameworks like the proximity principle in waste management. However, in regions with complex topography, Euclidean distance poorly approximates functional accessibility, causing misallocations that undermine efficiency and equity. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to quantify misallocation risk by modeling travel distances as random scaling of Euclidean distances and deriving incorrect assignment probability as a function of local Voronoi geometry. Using plant-municipality observations (n=383) in Extremadura, Spain (41,635 km2), we demonstrate that the Log-Normal distribution provides best relative fit among alternatives (K-S statistic=0.110). Validation reveals 15.4% of municipalities are misallocated, consistent with the theoretical prediction interval (52-65 municipalities at 95% confidence). Our framework achieves 95% agreement with complex spatial models at O(n) complexity. Poor absolute fit of global distributions (p-values<0.01) reflects diverse topography (elevation 200-2,400m), motivating spatial stratification. Sensitivity analysis validates the fitted dispersion parameter (s=0.093) for predicting observed misallocation. We provide a calibration protocol requiring only 30-100 pilot samples per zone, enabling rapid risk assessment without full network analysis. This establishes the first probabilistic framework for Voronoi misallocation risk with practical guidelines emphasizing spatial heterogeneity and context-dependent calibration.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate simultaneous imaging at 0.549 THz and 1.012 THz with an optical overlay using a two-species atomic-vapour-based technique. The atomic vapour, comprising laser-pumped rubidium and caesium atoms contained within the same cell, is used to convert two narrowband terahertz signals to optical frequencies which can then be detected using standard CMOS sensors. We use the system to image and perform spectral analysis of material samples. As atomic vapour is optically transparent, by using optically-transparent terahertz lenses, we can achieve simultaneous optical imaging, allowing for potential integration of terahertz sensitivity into a range of optical imaging devices.",

    "abstract": "Space-time varying media enable unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves, yet most existing studies assume idealized, nondispersive materials and thus fail to capture the intrinsic frequency dispersion of realistic platforms. Here, we develop a general framework for dispersive space-time varying systems that rigorously identifies the physically allowed frequency transitions of waves scattered at uniformly moving interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion. These states extend beyond conventional nondispersive scattering, revealing qualitatively new regimes of space-time scattering regimes. Our results establish a rigorous foundation for the design of realistic space-time metamaterials, with immediate relevance to emerging experiments in epsilon-near-zero optical platforms and open pathways for dispersion-engineered wave manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino oscillations arise from quantum interference between neutrino mass eigenstates and are governed by the PMNS matrix. Although this is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, its mathematical structure is analogous to systems of coupled classical oscillators. In this work, a three--pendulum system connected by springs is constructed as a classical analog of three--flavor neutrino oscillations. Measurements of amplitude transfer, normal--mode structure, and beat frequencies are used to extract a mechanical mixing matrix, which is compared with the structure of the PMNS matrix under the assumption of zero CP violation. A scaling relation linking mechanical time evolution to the neutrino \\(L/E\\) behavior is derived, clarifying the scope and limitations of the analogy. The experiment demonstrates how abstract concepts of neutrino mixing can be visualized using simple and accessible classical systems, offering both pedagogical value and a qualitative understanding of flavor oscillation dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.",

The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.",

Using flyer-plate impact experiments as a benchmark, we show that both two-dimensional (2D) models can reproduce the measured particle velocity histories, but through fundamentally different mechanisms. In the P-alpha framework, applying a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential to capture the particle velocity evolution, though calibration of other constitutive parameters, such as crush-out pressure, still strongly influences the response. In contrast, mesoscale simulations are less sensitive to parameter tuning and rely critically on the physical state variable of porosity, represented in 2D as an equivalent measure of the 3D specimen. Together, these results establish that their mechanical interpretations differ: continuum parameters act as effective surrogates for grain-scale physics, whereas mesoscale modeling reveals porosity as the dominant control of macroscopic wave onset.",

In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.",

To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors.

Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.",

In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable.

Dynamics of quasi-solitons in the model is addressed by means of analytical and numerical methods. The sech-based approximation for the quasi-soliton predicts it as a stable fixed point (FP) of the system of evolution equations for the moments of the system moments (the HF norm, wave momentum, and center-of-mass coordinate). The attraction basin of the FP is identified too. The prediction is corroborated by direct simulations of the full LLE.

    "abstract": "Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.",

A striking feature of ParT is its sparse, nearly binary, attention structure, raising questions about the origin of this behavior and whether it encodes physically meaningful correlations. In this work, we investigate the source of ParT's sparse attention by comparing models trained on multiple benchmark datasets and examine the relative contributions of the attention term and the physics-inspired interaction matrix before softmax. We find that binary sparsity arises primarily from the attention mechanism itself, with the interaction matrix playing a secondary role. Moreove, we show that ParT is able to identify key jet substructure elements, such as leptons in semileptonic top decays, even without explicit particle identification inputs. These results provide new insight into the interpretability of transformer-based jet taggers and clarify the conditions under which sparse attention patterns emerge in ParT.",

    "title": "DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants",
    "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.",

    "abstract": "Flagellated microswimmers B. Subtilis dispersed in a nematic phase of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal form a living liquid crystal (LLC). The combination of the passive and active components allows us to analyze how the active component transitions from the shear-imposed alignment into topological turbulence. The lateral extension of the experimental cell is 1000 times larger than the 10-micrometer thickness, to avoid the effect of lateral confinement on the dynamic patterns. The surface anchoring is azimuthally degenerate to avoid permanent anisotropy. After the shear cessation, active forces produced by the microswimmers trigger self-amplifying bend undulations. The amplitude of undulations grows with time and then saturates, while the wavelength increases only slightly. Strong bend stresses at the extrema of undulations are released by nucleating disclination pairs, which multiply to produce topological turbulence. The nucleating pairs and the symmetry axes of the +1/2 disclinations are orientationally ordered. In highly active LLCs, this alignment causes a nonmonotonous time dependence of the disclinations' number, as a fast-moving +1/2 disclination of one pair annihilates a -1/2 disclination of the neighboring pair. The spectra of elastic and kinetic energies exhibit distinct wavevector dependencies caused by the energy cost of the deformed passive nematic background. The study demonstrates how applied shears and a passive viscoelastic background affect the dynamics of active matter. Combined with the previously determined viscoelastic properties of the lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, the results complete a comprehensive description of the experimentally assessable type of active matter.",

    "abstract": "Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\\eta_{\\text{mem}}\\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.",

    "abstract": "Robotic continuous control tasks impose stringent demands on the energy efficiency and latency of computing architectures due to their high-dimensional state spaces and real-time interaction requirements. Conventional electronic computing platforms face computational bottlenecks, whereas the fusion of photonic computing and spiking reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. Here, we propose a novel computing architecture based on photonic spiking RL, which integrates the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm with spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed architecture employs an optical-electronic hybrid computing paradigm wherein a silicon photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) chip executes linear matrix computations, while nonlinear spiking activations are performed in the electronic domain. Experimental validation on the Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v2 benchmarks demonstrates the system capability for software-hardware co-inference, achieving a control policy reward of 5831 on HalfCheetah-v2, a 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, and an action deviation below 2.2%. Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems.",

The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed. We find that pronounced boundary layers develop even at low Reynolds numbers based on the power-law exponents. The new class of stress power-law fluids and fluids that exhibit limiting stress also show the ability to develop boundary layers.",

    "abstract": "Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete. The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group. When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks. The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.",

    "abstract": "In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $\\Phi_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD.",

Using large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a self-developed neural network potential,we show that Nb atoms predominantly occupy Ti sites and form short-range order with neighboring Al atoms, but a non-negligible fraction also occupies Al sites (NbAl) and promotes the formation of antisite defects (TiAl). Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity. Meanwhile, these substitutional and antisite defects also increase the Peierls stress of both screw and edge dislocations, which hinders dislocation motion to cause pronounced solid-solution strengthening. This work provides mechanistic insights into the dual role of Nb in enhancing both strength and ductility in {\\gamma}-TiAl and further offers guidance for defect and composition engineering in advanced alloy systems.",

Measuring the internal stress of tissues has proven crucial for our understanding of the role of mechanical forces in fundamental biological processes like morphogenesis, collective migration, cell division or cell elimination and death. Previously, we have introduced Bayesian Inversion Stress Microscopy (BISM), which is relying on measuring cell-generated traction forces in vitro and has proven particularly useful to measure absolute stresses in confined cell monolayers. We further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of BISM across various experimental settings with different boundary conditions, ranging from confined tissues of arbitrary shape to monolayers composed of different cell types. Importantly, BISM does not require assumptions on cell rheology. Therefore, it can be applied to complex heterogeneous tissues consisting of different cell types, as long as they can be grown on a flat substrate. Finally, we compare BISM to other common stress measurement techniques using a coherent experimental setup, followed by a discussion on its limitations and further perspectives.",

    "abstract": "A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in agreement with the Born rule, and therefore violating Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited.

Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.",

In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena.

    "abstract": "Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.",

    "title": "Fundamental Advances in Short-Circuit Measurement: A Novel Time-Resolved Diode-Clamp Circuit Paradigm",
    "abstract": "Conventional electrical fault models, which rely on static thresholds and instantaneous trip mechanisms, fail to capture the time-evolving dynamics of real faults, creating vulnerabilities in modern power systems. This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE>1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.",

The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F.

    "title": "Chain of Unit-Physics: A Primitive-Centric Approach to Scientific Code Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.",

Here, we present a theoretical description of the instantaneous translational diffusion coefficients of transmembrane protein aggregates on free and supported lipid membranes using Kirkwood-Riseman theory. We find that hydrodynamic interactions within protein aggregates must be accounted for, as neglecting them yields several times lower diffusion coefficients. By deriving hydrodynamic radii for free and supported lipid membranes, we identify effective length scales that accurately characterize aggregate diffusivities in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. These findings motivate the approximation of an aggregate by its outline and a random particle distribution inside it. We show that this approach provides a practical method to accurately determine aggregate diffusion coefficients when the particle locations cannot be resolved. The results presented in this article have immediate implications for the formation and function of membrane protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) presents a persistent controversy in the literature, evidenced by a wide disparity in the reported values for the $\\sigma_E$ cross-sections. Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.",

We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

    "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) reduces computational costs in CFD by concentrating resolution where needed, but efficiently embedding complex, non-aligned geometries on GPUs remains challenging. We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\\text{Re}\\in\\{10, 15, 20\\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids.

We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates.",

A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.",

By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces.",

    "abstract": "In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.",

Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite.

We have been developing a ten-superconductor-layer planarized fabrication process with NbN kinetic inductors and searching for suitable self-shunted JJs to potentially replace high Josephson critical current density, Jc, Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb junctions. We report on the fabrication and electrical properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN junctions produced by reactive sputtering in Ar+N2 mixture on 200-mm wafers at 200 oC and incorporated into a planarized process with two Nb ground planes and Nb wiring layer. Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes. IcRn products up to ~ 0.5 mV were obtained for JJs with Jc~ 0.6 mA/um^2. Jc(T) dependences have been measured.",

We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.",

The method is built on a stochastic integro-differential formulation derived from the Langevin bridge formalism, which constrains molecular trajectories to reach a prescribed final state within a finite time and yields an efficient low-temperature approximation of the exact bridge equation. To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions.",

    "abstract": "Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape. In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics.",

Using a particle-based model that resolves nutrient fields as well as cellular orientations and their inheritance, we investigate how orientational order emerges within expanding fronts whose morphology is set by nutrient limitation. We identify a transition in nematic order controlled by front morphology, with orientational memory influencing alignment only on one side of this transition. Under strong inheritance, orientational order varies non-monotonically: both thin active layers (fingering morphologies) and thick active layers (flat fronts) produce strong alignment, whereas intermediate cases are less ordered. Analysis of velocities, reorientation statistics, and stress anisotropies shows that this behavior reflects a shift from inheritance-dominated to mechanically driven alignment that overrides lineage memory. The resulting differences in front speed produce a fitness advantage of orientational memory only in the diffusion-limited, memory-dominated regime. These findings elucidate how nutrient supply, mechanical interactions, and single-cell expansion together shape self-organization during growth.",

Previous work in one-dimensional periodic systems identified a fitness advantage associated with rapid dead-cell clearance, an \"opportunistic\" competition mechanism. Extending this framework, we study two-dimensional cellular aggregates and show that dimensionality modifies the interplay between competition mechanisms for clones with different clearance rates: in 2D, opportunistic and homeostatic-pressure-based competition jointly shape clonal selection, to varying degrees. We then introduce an explicit circular confinement to probe how boundaries modulate this interplay. While opportunistic competition persists, distinct timescale-dependent behaviors emerge through weakened homeostatic-pressure-based competition near boundaries. Structural analysis reveals that confinement promotes tangential alignment and spatially heterogeneous homeostatic pressure, thereby reshaping competitive outcomes at tissue edges. Our study connects newly discovered competition mechanisms with more realistic biological contexts, highlighting how dimensionality and spatial constraints influence tissue structures and modulate competition in heterogeneous cell populations, with implications for tumor growth dynamics and tissue development.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the $e^+e^-$ high-energy superconducting linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) and multiple use of beams has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider can operate in either pulsed (with duty factor DF) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we point out that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in the pulsed mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient G (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate with the highest available accelerating gradients. This is also true for the CW mode at a power significantly exceeding the threshold power for this mode. The $e^+e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor of cavities as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/2}$. We also consider for the first time a twin $e^-e^-$ collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling since electrons can be produced anew each time. The $e^-e^-$ luminosity depends on the quality factor as $L\\propto Q_0^{1/4}$. RF travelling-wave structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)\\,$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable total powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively.

    "abstract": "The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.",

However, calculating SUV from DICOM files presents challenges due to vendor-specific DICOM attributes and variations in the encoding of radiotracer accumulation times. This technical note introduces a robust, vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy that addresses inconsistencies in current methodologies. We also integrate this strategy into an open-source software solution, Z-Rad, capable of converting raw PET DICOM data into body-weight normalized SUV NIfTI files. Our SUV calculation strategy was developed by reviewing DICOM conformance statements from GE, Philips, and Siemens. Validation was conducted using real-world PET datasets, and the proposed strategy was compared to existing software solutions. Our SUV calculation approach demonstrated improved accuracy, particularly in resolving time-related discrepancies in the studied data. Our analysis also identified inconsistencies in the SUV calculation methods used by popular commercial and open-source software solutions, which do not fully account for vendor-specific DICOM attributes and PET image acquisition times. These limitations resulted in errors in SUV estimation reaching 33\\% when comparing our strategy to studied software. The proposed vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy significantly enhances accuracy in PET imaging by addressing key inconsistencies caused by variations in DICOM attributes and image acquisition times across different vendors. This method effectively reduces SUV calculation errors and has been integrated into an open-source software, Z-Rad.",

Despite its importance, the cause of this unexpectedly low human loss was unclear because of the limited access to the peninsula and the presence of many visitors during the holiday, which made conducting conventional surveys infeasible. Here, we reveal evacuation behaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula tsunami using massive geolocation data collected from a smartphone app. By analysing these massive data, which include over 1.5 million records collected on this day, we find that the evacuation was extremely fast, occurring within 2--6 minutes after the origin time. Further analyses suggest that these fast departures were driven mainly by strong ground shaking; the fact that the tsunami occurred during the family-oriented New Year holiday was also a key factor. Additionally, the long-term analysis of the data reveals that people started returning to the coastal area 20--100 minutes after the origin time, which was long before the downgrading and cancellation of the tsunami warnings. These results highlight the utility of the innovative data-driven approach to evacuation surveys, which addresses the limitations of conventional evacuation surveys.",

    "title": "Origin of slow earthquake statistics in low-friction soft granular shear",
    "abstract": "Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and size distribution dominated by smaller events. However, the physical origin of these slow earthquake statistics remains controversial. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. To model slow-earthquake fault materials under hydrothermal conditions, we use a low-friction soft hydrogel particle layer floating on lubricating fluid and conduct stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as with slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with sparse contact structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may be driven by pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.",

    "title": "Capturing methane in a barn environment: the CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project",
    "abstract": "The CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project explores the development of a prototype system for capturing methane emissions in barn environments, offering an alternative approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming. Methane (CH4), with a global warming potential significantly higher than CO2 (GWP100 = 27), accounts for ~23% of anthropogenic climate impact. In 2021, The Assessment Report 6 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change quantified CH4 livestock emissions in 123 Mt/yr, which, together with substantial N2O and CO2 emissions, contributed with a 12% to global emissions. Unlike strategies focused on altering animal feed, CH4rLiE investigates post-emission capture using porous materials, such as zeolites, to adsorb methane from barn air. The project draws on CERN's experience with gas recovery systems for particle detectors, adapting similar technologies to agricultural settings. Preliminary estimates, based on measured CH4 concentrations (~20 mg/m3) and partial air filtration in a 250-animal barn, suggest a low but detectable recovery potential, subject to validation through simulation and in-situ testing. Prototype development considers the potential for energy-efficient operation - possibly through pressure swing regeneration - and compatibility with existing ventilation infrastructure, though these aspects remain under evaluation. If methane concentrations in barns prove too diluted, the system may be better suited for environments with higher gas levels, such as pigsties or landfills. NH3 capture for fertilizer production is planned as a future enhancement. CH4rLiE aims to assess the feasibility of emission recovery in livestock settings without affecting animal welfare, contributing to sustainable farming practices, resource efficiency, and circular bioeconomy goals.",

With a momentum capability reaching 11 GeV/c, the SHMS provides measurements of charged particles produced in electron-scattering experiments using the maximum available beam energy from the upgraded Jefferson Lab accelerator. The SHMS is an ion-optics magnetic spectrometer comprised of a series of new superconducting magnets which transport charged particles through an array of triggering, tracking, and particle-identification detectors that measure momentum, energy, angle and position in order to allow kinematic reconstruction of the events back to their origin at the scattering target. The detector system is protected from background radiation by a sophisticated shielding enclosure. The entire spectrometer is mounted on a rotating support structure which permits measurements to be taken with a large acceptance over laboratory scattering angles from 5.5 to 40 degrees, thus allowing a wide range of low cross-section experiments to be conducted. These experiments complement and extend the previous Hall C research program to higher energies.",

    "abstract": "Water exhibits many unique properties compared to other liquids, with some of these explained and others remaining enigmatic. Among them, it was proposed and extensively debated that hot water would freeze faster than cold water. Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulty of successfully elucidating this effect, making explanations surrounding this phenomenon highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that when two cups filled with cold and hot water are introduced simultaneously in a freezer saturated with ice-nucleating agents, the hot sample freezes faster and to a greater depth than the cold sample, particularly when the initial temperature difference is high. On the other hand, against some previous beliefs, the time to onset of crystallization is always and logically retarded for hotter samples. Under these conditions, where supercooling is eliminated and temperature recording is precisely controlled, robust experiments follow the same trend,regardless of whether hot versus room temperature (RT) samples or RT versus cold samples are tested.",

We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "The diurnal cycle of precipitation near New Guinea involves intricate land-ocean-atmosphere interactions, posing substantial challenges for tropical weather and climate simulations. Using over two decades of GPM satellite observations and convection-permitting WRF simulations, this study examines the physical mechanisms governing the pronounced offshore propagation of diurnal convection over New Guinea. We identify two distinct convective propagation modes: (1) a \"ridge-to-coast\" mode originated over elevated terrain and migrating toward the coastline, and (2) an \"over-ocean\" mode initiated near the coast, separated by a spatial gap of approximately 100 km. Our findings highlight the critical role of multi-scale density currents in shaping boundary layer dynamics over warm ocean waters. Specifically, the afternoon sea-breeze front advects cooler air onshore, stabilizing the lower atmosphere and interrupting the continuous propagation of the first mode. At night, the hybrid land breeze, enriched by cold pools, generates offshore moist patches that facilitate the convective regeneration and propagation of the second mode. These offshore convective systems interact with monsoonal background winds, sustaining precipitation well beyond 200-600 km from the coast. Sensitivity experiments indicate that even a modest increase in sea surface temperature can enhance convective intensity and extend offshore propagation. These results shed light on the mechanisms that enable diurnal offshore convection to persist overnight and propagate far from the coastline, highlighting the importance of moist-boundary-layer density currents and offering insights for improving precipitation forecasts and global model performance over the Maritime Continent.",

    "abstract": "Typically, numerical simulations of Earth systems are coarse, and Earth observations are sparse and gappy. We apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. Two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider multiple test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantifications of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that the generated super-resolution fields of SDEdit are unphysical, while those of DPS are reasonable but with smoothed fine-scale features; however, neither of these lower-cost models propagates observational information effectively to unobserved regions. The two conditional models require re-training, but reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and predict correct turbulence statistics, including the tails. Further, their mean errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the tradeoffs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment.",

    "abstract": "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a powerful platform for investigating low-energy excitations in quantum materials. Because these materials are often limited in size, experimental setups typically rely on tightly focused beams and metallic holders with small apertures. In this work, we perform a systematic study of how aperture geometry influences THz signal transmission in a standard free-space configuration. By analyzing time- and frequency-domain data for circular apertures of varying diameters and thicknesses, we quantify the spatial and spectral filtering effects imposed by aperture size. We show that small apertures progressively attenuate low-frequency components of the transmitted signal, while higher-frequency content remains comparatively unaffected. These effects become especially significant for apertures smaller than typical THz beam waists, resulting in amplitude suppression and phase distortions that compromise the accuracy of frequency-domain analysis and optical parameter retrieval. To validate these observations, additional measurements were performed on a representative quantum material, confirming the practical relevance of the identified aperture effects. The transmitted intensity as a function of aperture diameter also provides a straightforward method for estimating the beam waist at the focus. In contrast, standard aperture thicknesses do not introduce measurable distortions, confirming the adequacy of treating thick, non-resonant apertures as dielectric slabs. These findings establish practical guidelines for aperture selection in THz-TDS and underscore the importance of preserving low-frequency response for reliable characterization of quantum materials.",

In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves, and also boundary-induced wave interference arising from divergent and convergent reflected wave trajectories with varying growth rates. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.",

Our results show that filamentation of these beams in air leads to the formation of intense axially modulated light filaments, and corrugated plasma strings with high modulation depths and tunable modulation periods. We find that the modulation periods of the intensity and the plasma density are identical and comparable to the modulation period of the intensity in the linear propagation regime. Furthermore, we show that, in the nonlinear propagation regime, the modulation period is independent of the pulse energy and can be tuned by selecting appropriate central spot sizes for the interfering Bessel beams. Finally, we propose a simple interferometric arrangement using a single axicon to generate two interfering Bessel beams with adjustable spot sizes enabling the creation of axially-modulated plasma strings with tunable periodicity at high input powers.",

The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV industry cluster in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, with the fastest growth observed in Yubei, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes areas with higher population density, higher income levels, and adequate land availability for pile deployment, rather than broad geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.",

    "abstract": "Curable hydrogels have tunable properties that make them well-suited for applications in drug delivery, cell therapies, and 3D bioprinting. Advances in microfluidic droplet generation enable rapid fabrication of polymer-filled droplets. UV-curable polymers offer a clear path toward using fluidic generation to produce monodisperse microgels with uniform properties. In flow, polymer concentration and UV exposure both control the degree of crosslinking. High UV intensity is often used to ensure complete gelation and avoid complications that may arise from partial curing. Optical microscopy can assess droplet and particle sizes in flow. However, optimizing formulations for mechanical properties usually requires removal of generated material and external measurement outside of flow. In this study, we couple droplet generation, microgel fabrication, and mechanics assessment within a single fluidic device. We make and measure soft polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) microgels by curing polymer-filled water drops in mineral oil. Crosslinking is tuned by varying UV dosage, allowing us to study how gelation degree influences microgel properties. Within the device, we use shape deformation in flow to measure the restoring stress of both droplets and particles. Our results suggest that PEGDA droplets gel from the inside out. If gelation is incomplete, a particle resides within a fluid drop. Independent measurements outside of flow corroborate this observation. Crosslinking PEGDA-filled droplets in a pendant drop geometry, with dye, suggests the persistence of an aqueous shell around the gel. Similarly, microparticles in PEGDA-filled drops undergoing gelation exhibit diffusive arrest near the drop center, while maintaining mobility in an outer region. Together, these results suggest the importance of considering the extent of gelation when fabricating microgels using fluidics.",

Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.",

In this work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. The fibers are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc 1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterized with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. An imaging test of a lead block was also performed, and the reconstructed results are consistent with the blocks profile. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications.",

While recent advances have clarified how individual cells process and respond to external signals, understanding collective cellular decision making remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a minimal, analytically tractable, model of cell patterning via local cell-cell communication. Using this framework, we identify a trade-off between the speed and accuracy of collective pattern formation and, by adapting techniques from stochastic chemical kinetics, quantify how information flows between cells during patterning. Our analysis reveals counterintuitive features of collective patterning: globally optimized solutions do not necessarily maximize intercellular information transfer and individual cells may appear suboptimal in isolation. Moreover, the model predicts that instantaneous information shared between cells can be non-monotonic in time as patterning occurs. An analysis of recent experimental data from lateral inhibition in Drosophila pupal abdomen finds a qualitatively similar effect.",

Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.",

    "abstract": "Whilst surface-stress integration remains the standard approach for fluid force evaluation, control-volume integral methods provide deeper physical insights through functional relationships between the flow field and the resultant force. In this work, by introducing a second-order tensor weight function into the Navier-Stokes equations, we develop a novel weighted-integral framework that offers greater flexibility and enhanced capability for fluid force diagnostics in incompressible flows. Firstly, in addition to the total force and moment, the weighted integral methods establish, for the first time, rigorous quantitative connections between the surface-stress distribution and the flow field, providing potential advantages for flexible body analyses. Secondly, the weighted integral methods offer alternative perspectives on force mechanisms, through vorticity dynamics or pressure view, when the weight function is set as divergence-free or curl-free, respectively. Thirdly, the derivative moment transformation (DMT)-based integral methods (Wu et al., J. Fluid Mech. vol. 576, 2007, 265-286) are generalised to weighted formulations, by which the interconnections among the three DMT methods are clarified. In the canonical problem of uniform flow past a circular cylinder, weighted integral methods demonstrate advantages in yielding new force expressions, improving numerical accuracy over original DMT methods, and enhancing surface-stress analysis. Finally, a force expression is derived that relies solely on velocity and acceleration at discrete points, without spatial derivatives, offering significant value for experimental force estimation. This weighted integral framework holds significant promise for flow diagnostics in fundamentals and applications.",

This target design philosophy has the potential to yield practical, room temperature targets that could yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, that has the potential to enable Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields.

Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in the subcritical Faraday regime.",

However, conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\\times2$ pixel group. The phase gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens, which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.",

Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and the human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.",

    "abstract": "Capillary retraction of Herschel-Bulkley ligaments displays a rich set of behaviors that depart significantly from the classical Newtonian picture. We focus here on the low-viscosity regime, where droplet detachment is controlled by the end-pinching mechanism. Using fully resolved axisymmetric simulations, we show that viscoplasticity and shear-dependent rheology reorganize the fundamental routes by which a retracting ligament may pinch off or escape breakup. Four dynamical outcomes are identified: inertial pinch-off, viscous escape driven by an attached vorticity layer, inertial escape caused by vortex-ring detachment, and complete arrest when yielding suppresses motion. These regimes appear in an orderly structure across the rheological parameter space, but their transitions are governed by a single unifying feature of the neck dynamics: whether inertia, viscous diffusion, or yield stress dominates the local collapse. When inertia dominates, the vorticity sheet detaches and rolls into a vortex ring, producing an inertial rebound of the neck. When viscous effects dominate, the vorticity layer remains attached and drives a back-flow that reopens the neck. When yield stress is sufficiently large, both mechanisms are suppressed and the ligament becomes motionless. This framework extends the Newtonian end-pinching and escape mechanisms to viscoplastic fluids and clarifies how non-Newtonian rheology reshapes capillary-driven retraction.",

However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive validation, performance characterization, and scalability analysis of a hardware-accelerated phase-averaged multiscale solver designed to simulate acoustically driven dilute bubbly suspensions. The carrier fluid is modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The dispersed phase is represented through two distinct subgrid formulations: a volume-averaged model that explicitly treats discrete bubbles within a Lagrangian framework, and an ensemble-averaged model that statistically represents the bubble population through a discretized distribution of bubble sizes. For both models, the bubble dynamics are modeled via the Keller--Miksis equation. For the GPU cases, we use OpenACC directives to offload computation to the GPUs. The volume-averaged model is validated against the analytical Keller-Miksis solution and experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement with root-mean-squared errors of less than 8% for both single-bubble oscillation and collapse scenarios. The ensemble-averaged model is validated by comparing it to volume-averaged simulations. On an NCSA Delta node with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we observe a speedup 16-fold compared to a 64-core AMD Milan CPU. The ensemble-averaged model offers additional reductions in computational cost by solving a single set of averaged equations, rather than multiple stochastic realizations. However, the volume-averaged model enables the interrogation of individual bubble dynamics, rather than the averaged statistics of the bubble dynamics. Weak and strong scaling tests demonstrate good scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. These results show the proposed method is robust, accurate, and efficient for the multiscale simulation of acoustically driven dilute bubbly flows.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy. As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of duct aspect ratio ($AR$), defined as the ratio of major to minor axis in an elliptical duct, on shock train dynamics for a freestream Mach number of 2.1. The aspect ratio $AR$ is varied from 1.0 to 3.0 while maintaining a constant cross-sectional area and identical upstream conditions, thereby ensuring the same inlet mass flow and nearly constant boundary-layer-induced blockage across all $AR$. This isolates shape-induced confinement effects. Simulations are performed using an embedded-boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement which enabled a finest resolution of 48$\\mu$m resolving the shocks in the shock train. The results show that increasing $AR$ significantly modifies the shock train morphology. The number of discrete shock cells decreases, and the leading shock front elongates along the major axis while contracting along the minor axis. The normal shock stem prominent in the circular duct (AR=1.0) nearly disappears at AR=3.0. Despite these morphological changes, the wall-pressure trace and stagnation-pressure loss remain largely insensitive to $AR$. These results indicate that while duct cross-section governs the detailed shock train structure, the overall efficiency of flow deceleration and pressure recovery is dictated primarily by the effective blockage imposed by the turbulent boundary layer, rather than the aspect ratio itself for a given mass flow rate and pressure ratio across the pseudo shock.",

    "abstract": "Between the linear and nonlinear regimes, we identify a universal transition range centered on a characteristic halo mass $m_h^*\\propto t$, within which gravitational dynamics self-organize the matter field toward an effective spectral index n=-1. In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\\tau_g\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$ and $\\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\\tau_{gr}\\propto r^{-\\gamma}$, yielding density $\\rho_r\\propto r^{-2\\gamma}$ and $\\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\\varepsilon_u \\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration. The dependence of waiting time and step length on the particle mass suggests new constraints near $10^{12}$GeV.",

To isolate debris signals from background, the exposure time is set to match the time it takes a debris to transit through the instantaneous field of view. Debris signatures are detected by multiscale X-ray processing of the data cube.

We exhibit an illustrative implementation of this framework, fit to a resistive drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors, based on a proposed linear conductance model for resistive drift in the devices. Finally, we highlight the application of the model to neuromorphic computing, through demonstrating the contribution of the volatility state variable to switching dynamics, resulting in frequency-dependent switching (for stable memristors acting as programmable synaptic weights) and the generation of action potentials (for unstable memristors, acting as spike-generators).",

Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.",

Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio Mähönen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.",

The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.",

Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality.

The full reconstruction history is made available, allowing inclusive and exclusive jets to be retrieved. The package also provides the means to visualise the reconstruction. Substructure algorithms have been added that allow advanced analysis techniques to be employed.

In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.",

By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof.

Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.",

While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous Hall effect (AHE)-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos.

In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of this article is to introduce a technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside each voxel of an MR image. The method is based on the use of motion sensitizing gradients with changing first moment to encode velocity. As such, it is completely non-invasive and requires no contrast injections. Methods: The technique consists of acquiring a series of images preceded by preparatory RF pulses that encode velocity information, analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity distribution can be decoded via the Fourier transform. We demonstrate its use on a simple flow phantom with known flow characteristics. We demonstrate the technique on the brains of five human participants from whom we collected the velocity distribution along each of the three laboratory axes. Results: Velocity distribution measurements on simple phantoms yielded velocity distributions consistent with theory. Human velocity spectra identified specific anatomical features at different velocity bins. The largest fraction of spins was in the lowest velocity bands. Movement in the CSF spaces could be clearly identified at different velocity bands. Conclusion: Velocity Spectrum Imaging has great potential as a tool to study the movement of fluids in the human body without contrast agents. In addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in vivo, it can be used to study the complex movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders. However, further development is needed to probe the velocity spectrum in the ultra-low velocity regime of the perivascular spaces.",

    "abstract": "Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.",

    "abstract": "Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\\mathrm{\\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\\mathrm{\\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.",

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections.

The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data.

To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.",

We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections.

We derive the $N$-body theory on equal-$x$ slices as the Carrollian limit of a relativistic multi-time Klein-Gordon model, introducing temporal interactions via minimal coupling to the temporal energy operators. An $x$-dependent gauge transformation maps this to an equivalent description with explicit many-body potentials, illustrated by a temporal coupled-oscillator model that exhibits synchronization. Adopting a complementary spatial viewpoint with a static potential $U_{\\!tot}(\\mathbf x)$, we show that the evolution is driven by the collective force $\\sum_j\\partial_{x_j}U_{\\!tot}$; for any translation-invariant interaction (such as a regularized Coulomb potential), these internal forces cancel, rendering the collective dynamics free and highlighting Carrollian ultralocality. We also construct a coordinate duality mapping separable Schrödinger Hamiltonians to CS generators via Schwarzian derivatives. Exchange symmetry is formulated in the time domain, yielding temporal bunching for bosons and antibunching for fermions via the second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(t,t')$. In second quantization, the contact limit yields a temporal derivative cubic--quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a theoretically fixed nonlinearity coefficient $\\beta=-3/16$.

    "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is widely regarded as a promising approach to overcome quantum hardware limitations. A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.",

Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions.

    "abstract": "In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $\\Phi_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD.",

    "title": "A Concatenated Dual Displacement Code for Continuous-Variable Quantum Error Correction",
    "abstract": "The continuous-variable (CV) Gaussian no-go theorem fundamentally limits the suppression of Gaussian displacement errors using only Gaussian gates and states. Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures.",

    "abstract": "Local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states can effectively reduce the consumption of quantum resources and lower economic costs in quantum protocols. Although numerous achievements have been made regarding local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states, some fundamental issues have not been effectively addressed. For example, the local distinguishability of five orthogonal product states (OPSs) is still unknown up to now. In this paper, we give the properties of local distinguishability of five OPSs on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, to characterize the structure of a set of bipartite OPSs, we propose the concept of the vector of orthogonal relations for a set of bipartite OPSs. Secondly, we classify the structures of five bipartite OPSs into six categories by this concept and prove that five of these six categories can be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Thirdly we show that the local distinguishability of each case of the sixth category singly. On the other hand, we first divide the structures of five tripartite OPSs into eight categories by the vectors of orthogonal relations of five tripartite OPSs. Then we give the local distinguishability of each category. Our work enriches the research results of quantum nonlocality and will provide a clear understanding of the local distinguishability of five OPSs.",

In this work, we demonstrate the use of multiple-quantum solid-state NMR for quantum sensing by creating, manipulating, and detecting large clusters of correlated nuclear spins. We show that such clusters can sensitively detect pulse-width jitters in radio-frequency control fields at the level of tens of nanoseconds. By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information. These results support the solid-state NMR platform as a valuable testbed for investigating many-body quantum metrology protocols.",

On the other hand, this becomes important when making predictions about the properties of the subsystems, since the predictions are implicitly a function of the observable that was measured. Systems with finitely many levels are simpler to describe because the analysis is not encumbered by the mathematical technicalities of the continuous case, and the underlying physical interpretations are the same.",

This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical.

Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.",

In this regard, machine learning based algorithms have been employed successfully to find quasi inverse of quantum channels. The space of quantum channels in this scheme is a unit hypersphere, and components of mutually constrained unit vectors residing in this space, are used to construct a physically valid quantum channel. Symplectic constraints, orthogonality, and unit length of the vectors suffice to maintain complete positivity and the trace-preserving property of the channels. By performing gradient descent on this parametric space with a fidelity-based loss function, this approach is found to optimize quasi inverse of a variety of quantum channels, not limited to single-qubits, proving its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.",

The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases.

High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0.

To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks.

By leveraging this interplay, we demonstrate that OCT can enable entropy-modifying processes, such as targeted cooling or heating, while maintaining high-fidelity gate performance in noisy environments. To validate our approach, we employ high-precision numerical methods on an open quantum system implementing one- or two-qubit gates embedded in a larger Hilbert space. The results showcase robust gate operation even under significant dissipative influences, offering a concrete path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation under realistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum batteries have emerged as a platform for investigating whether quantum effects can accelerate energy storage beyond classical limits. Although a variety of charging schemes have reported signatures of quantum advantage, the fundamental physical requirements for achieving superextensive charging power remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power.",

    "abstract": "We present an exact description of the dynamics and the thermodynamics of a time dependent harmonic oscillator (TDHO) that follows a unitary evolution. In that context, we study the relationship between particle creation, adiabaticity and irreversibility in terms of three different representations: the initial, the diagonal and the invariant representations of the TDHO. We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs. They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit. The condition of no production of entropy under unitary evolution suggests the definition of a mode temperature that would correspond to the thermal temperature is some appropriate limit.",

    "abstract": "Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.",

We begin by examining quantum techniques that could replace key subroutines in conventional anomaly detection frameworks to mitigate their computational intensity. We then provide practical demonstrations of quantum-based anomaly detection methods, highlighting their capabilities. We present a technical implementation for detecting volatility regime changes in stock market data using quantum reservoir computing, which is a special type of quantum machine learning model. The experimental results indicate that quantum-based embeddings are a competitive alternative to classical ones in this particular example.

    "abstract": "Quantum thermodynamics has emerged as a central field for understanding how energy conversion processes occur in microscopic systems. In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.",

In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.",

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body (QMB) systems are generally computationally hard: the computing resources necessary to simulate them exactly can often exceed the existing computation resources by orders of magnitude. For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system. This approach offers a general and scalable route for data-driven discovery of emergent phenomena in complex quantum many-body systems.",

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.",

One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation. When applied to benchmark circuits, the default original variable orders resulted in slow simulations, whereas the proposed method achieved speedups of up to 150x.

The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs.",

    "title": "Passive Polarization Stabilization for Practical and Robust Entanglement Distribution",
    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.",

Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.",

However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.",

However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment.",

The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets.

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.",

The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) represents a leading hybrid quantum-classical paradigm for addressing this challenge; however, its widespread realization is limited by noise and the restricted scalability of current quantum hardware. Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations. Hamiltonian reduction strategies, including $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ tapering and frozen-core approximations, are examined to assess their effect on quantum resource scaling. The analysis reveals that appropriate transformations, when combined with symmetry-based reductions, can substantially reduce qubit counts by up to $\\approx 50\\%$ and quantum gate counts by up to $\\approx 45\\times$ for the representative set of molecular systems under study.

Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.",

Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.",

Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.",

This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.",

One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite.

    "abstract": "Simulating many-body open quantum systems is an extremely challenging problem, with methods often restricted to either models with nearest-neighbor interactions or semi-classical approximations. In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods.",

The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.",

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline. As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols.

    "abstract": "The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.",

    "abstract": "Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.",

The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.",

However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.",

Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.",

    "abstract": "We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.",

    "abstract": "Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit. Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.",

In this work we propose a new, tunable, optically trapped sensor specifically designed to detect such forces. Our design features a high-mass (mg) plate whose weight is supported by a vertical beam. We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies. We demonstrate that our sensor could offer unique access to large regions of uncharted parameter space of vector B-L dark matter, with projected sensitivities that could advance existing limits by several orders of magnitude over a broad range of frequencies.",

Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.",

    "abstract": "Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.",

In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.",

    "abstract": "We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\\alpha}$ (with $\\alpha \\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \\alpha < 2$.",

Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.",

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.",

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

    "abstract": "Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.",

Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.",

    "abstract": "For the sandwiched Rényi entropy the conditional entropy can be defined two ways: $\\widetilde{H}^\\downarrow_\\alpha(A|B)_\\rho, \\widetilde{H}^\\uparrow_\\alpha(A|B)_\\rho$. In the limiting case, $\\alpha=1$, both definitions consolidate into conditional entropy $H(A|B)=S(AB)-S(B)$. The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the Rényi conditional entropy $\\widetilde{H}^\\uparrow_\\alpha$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\\widetilde{H}^\\downarrow_\\alpha(A|B)_\\rho, \\widetilde{T}^\\downarrow_\\alpha(A|B)_\\rho$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system.

    "abstract": "The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.",

Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\\chi^{(2)}$--$\\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude.

A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.",

An important problem in any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic transformations. Here, we investigate the intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity and the probability of state transformations. We derive limitations on the transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite state.",

We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal tests on multi-partite quantum correlations form the basis of protocols that certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate test difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, but achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which can reduce the rate of randomness generation. As a result there is often a trade-off between maximum randomness and the amount of violation of a given Bell inequality. Here, we explore this trade-off for more than two parties. More precisely, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations with a particular violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. For any even number of parties, we find that maximum randomness cannot occur beyond a threshold quantum violation, which increases with the number of parties, and we give a conjectured form of the maximum randomness in terms of the MABK value. We also show that maximum randomness can be obtained for any MABK violation for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a technique for randomness certification, which we call \"expanding Bell inequalities\". Our technique allows a bipartite Bell expression to be used as a seed, and transformed into a multi-partite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.",

In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy $S(\\rho)$ and Rényi entropy $S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ of an $N$-dimensional quantum state $\\rho$, given access to independent samples of $\\rho$. Specifically, we provide the following: 1. A quantum estimator for $S(\\rho)$ with time complexity $\\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016). 2. A quantum estimator for $S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ with time complexity $\\tilde O(N^{4/\\alpha-2})$ for $0<\\alpha<1$ and $\\tilde O(N^{4-2/\\alpha})$ for $\\alpha>1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\\tilde O(N^{6/\\alpha})$ for $0<\\alpha<1$ and $\\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\\alpha>1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity. Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_\\alpha(\\rho)$. Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can \"samplize\" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\\tilde\\Theta(Q^2/\\delta)$ samples of $\\rho$.

Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization.

In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded\" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \\emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.",

Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.",

Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\\Theta(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits.

The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task.

We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations.

Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator.

In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \\sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value.

    "abstract": "To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability.

Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.",

    "abstract": "Rydberg atom arrays are a powerful platform for solving combinatorial optimization problems, owing to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, which imposes effective constraints on simultaneous atomic excitations. These constraints have enabled the encoding of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on unit disk graphs, where atoms interact within a fixed, globally defined blockade radius. However, this restriction limits the class of addressable problems. A natural extension is to consider disk graphs, which generalize unit disk graphs by allowing arbitrary disk radii and correspond to the intersection graphs of disks in the plane. Embedding such graphs in Rydberg systems requires moving beyond the standard, globally uniform blockade model. In this work, we introduce a local Rydberg blockade regime, which emerges when local drives are applied to different pairs of atoms involved in a potential interaction. We develop a general theoretical framework for this regime and propose two novel metrics, the correlation matrix and the maximum independence violation, to quantify the quality of the embedding. Using these metrics, we demonstrate that disk graphs can be meaningfully embedded into Rydberg atom arrays under local drive schemes, thereby expanding the landscape of quantum-addressable optimization problems. Finally, when evaluating approximate solutions of the MIS problem, characterized by near-optimal independent sets, local drive approaches exhibit significantly improved performance over global ones. These results highlight the practical advantage of local blockade engineering for approximate combinatorial optimization and open a path toward leveraging the analog capabilities of Rydberg platforms beyond conventional geometric constraints.",

We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle.

Our protocol uses ensemble-averaging over the outcomes of experiments initialized in Haar-random local product states, accompanied by random Pauli measurements, leading to the effective cancellation of interference terms so that a Heisenberg-limited regime emerges for short-time experiments. Furthermore, we show that the act of ensemble averaging makes unbiased estimation data, meaning all Hamiltonian parameters can be simultaneously estimated from the same data-set, removing the need for parameter isolation. We supplement the theoretical results by showing empirically that, even away from the asymptotic limit, one can surpass the SQL using randomly spread product-state ensembles. We do so numerically by learning a selection of different disordered multi-qubit Hamiltonians in a black-box learning scenario.",

    "abstract": "We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including simultaneous sub-Poissonian statistics and negative Wigner function, as well as quadrature squeezing, which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. Surprisingly, the controllable simultaneous nonclassical dynamics in the same physical parameter regime, which is induced by the optomechanical Kerr nonlinearity to the parametric DCE cannot occur in the standard DCE or Kerr-type systems. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.",

Yet measurements produce irreversible records, an apparently one-way causal flow, and the familiar notion that causes precede effects. Within the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI), this asymmetry is not fundamental but emergent. Isolated quantum systems are described by a two-component temporal state containing forward- and backward-propagating amplitudes. Their mixing, governed by a parameter $\\Delta(\\phi)$, defines a retrocausal coherence time $\\tau_{RC}(\\phi)$ beyond which advanced components are suppressed. As the system couples to amplifying environments characterized by a macroscopic parameter $\\phi$, $\\Delta(\\phi)$ decreases and the backward component is dynamically eliminated, giving rise to classical causality and effective collapse. QTSI aligns naturally with time-symmetric approaches from Wheeler--Feynman, Aharonov, and Price, agrees with all weak-measurement and quantum eraser results in their operational regimes, and predicts specific signatures in temporal echoes and chaotic cavities.

The number of adaptive steps then provides a natural parameter for computational power. Rather than assessing power only through sampling problems -- the usual benchmark -- we follow the ongoing shift toward tasks of practical relevance and study the quantum mean-value problem, i.e., estimating observable expectation values that underpin simulation and variational algorithms. More specifically, we analyze bosonic circuits with adaptivity and prove that when the number of adaptive measurements is small, the mean-value problem admits efficient classical algorithms even if a large amount of non-Gaussian resources are present in the input state, whereas less constrained regimes are computationally hard. This yields a task-level contrast with sampling, where non-Gaussian ingredients alone often induce hardness, and provides a clean complexity boundary parameterized by the number of adaptive measurement-and-feedforward steps between classical simulability and quantum advantage. Beyond the main result, we introduce classical techniques -- including a generalization of Gurvits' second algorithm to arbitrary product inputs and Gaussian circuits -- for computing the marginal quantities needed by our estimators, which may be of independent interest.",

However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\sigma_2+\\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\\frac{\\sigma_0+\\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\sigma_2+\\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples.

Sequential scenarios are different in essence from non-local scenarios as each instrument is allowed to change the state as it enters subsequent instruments. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the possible state update in any hidden variable model description. Here we develop such hidden variable models for sequential scenarios, and we develop on the notion of no-disturbance: an instrument $A$ does not disturb another instrument $B$ if the statistics of $B$ are independent of whether $A$ was measured or not. We define non-contextuality inequalities for the sequential scenario, and show that violation implies that the data cannot be explained by a hidden variable model that is both deterministic and not disturbing in this sense. We further provide a translation from standard contextuality frameworks to ours, providing sequential versions which carry over the same inequalities and measures of contextuality, but now with the sequential interpretations stated.",

We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy).

Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the magic resource and bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. From a practical perspective, this finding substantially enhances the classical simulability of nonstabilizerness. It also allows us to utilize the bond dimension as a bridge to link the entanglement and the nonlocal magic resource, which extends the capacity perspective that the entanglement plays the role of container for the nonlocal magic resource. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement. This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that, any dynamical relation between magic and entanglement resources is ruled out. In other words, it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.",

    "abstract": "Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence. In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.",

    "abstract": "The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.",

Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol--which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage--with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to efficiently protect delocalized spin-wave excitation, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field.

The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.",

    "title": "An Optimal Framework for Constructing Lie-Algebra Generator Pools: Application to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for Chemistry",
    "abstract": "Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the role of symmetry in determining the low-noise behavior of high-dimensional quantum channels, with a focus on the modified Landau--Streater (MLS) family derived from spin-$j$ representations of $SU(2)$. We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.",

The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.",

We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\\nu$ and $\\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via \"tangential\" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\\nu - 1/\\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.",

However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\\nu>1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.",

In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients.

To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial.

In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.",

This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed. To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating unitaries from \"just a phase\"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the \"if let\" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design. We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics.

Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters.

    "abstract": "We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.",

We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\\theta$-vacuum model.",

    "abstract": "We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the \"missing heat flux\" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.",

The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter. Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects.

We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\\gamma = 0.739 \\pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\\theta = 0.51 \\pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\\% network dilution.

We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\\lambda^{-2}$, where $\\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.",

As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields.

In the symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) limit, we certify emergence and stability of simplicial complexes via a local boundary test and interior drift conditions that enforce downward-closure; in the mixed limit, we show that the minimal faithful object is a semi-simplicial set. We illustrate the theory with simulations that track the isotypic Frobenius norms and the higher-order structure.

This sequence has no multiplicative structure, no Euler product, and no singularity at s = 1. For every compactly supported Mellin-Laplace admissible kernel W, the smoothed shifted sum S_{W,h}(N) admits an absolutely convergent Mellin representation that holds entirely in the half-plane Re(s) > 1, with no use of analytic continuation. The Mellin transform of W provides quantitative vertical decay, enabling full contour control on the boundary line Re(s) = 1 + eps. A Tauberian boundary analysis shows that both components of the boundary integral grow like N^{1+eps}, while the oscillatory part contributes an unavoidable N^{1+eps} (log N)^2 term. As a result, the boundary integral cannot be decomposed into a dominant main term plus a smaller error term, revealing a structural obstruction to main-term extraction for fixed-shift correlations. These results give a complete analytic description of shifted prime correlations in their natural domain of convergence and clarify the analytic difficulties underlying problems such as the twin prime conjecture.",

Building on the algebraic invariant constructed in our previous work, we show that the motion of z(tau) is confined to a two-dimensional invariant tube in the extended phase space (z, p, tau) as long as the corresponding invariant level set remains closed. The main result of this paper is an explicit analytical rupture criterion that predicts the precise time at which the invariant tube loses regularity. After transforming the invariant into polar coordinates and analysing the discriminant of the resulting cubic equation for the radial coordinate, we obtain a compact Cardano-type expression for the rupture time. Direct numerical integrations of the z-equation confirm the analytical prediction to within a few percent over a wide parameter range. The results establish the rupture time as a robust and quantitatively accurate indicator for the onset of unbounded behaviour in aperiodically and parametrically forced nonlinear oscillators. The method is based purely on algebraic properties of the invariant and remains valid throughout the asymptotic domain of the perturbative expansion for y(tau).

Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies an equalized odds, that is, such that $I(Y;S|T) =0$. In contrast to our previous work, we assume here that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. Furthermore, we impose a geometric structure on the conditional distribution $P_{S|Y}$, allowing $Y$ and $S$ to have a small correlation, bounded by a threshold. When the threshold is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to approximate mutual information and reformulate the fair mechanism design problem as a quadratic program with closed-form solutions under certain constraints. For other cases, we derive simple, low-complexity lower bounds based on the maximum singular value and vector of a matrix. Finally, we compare our designs with the optimal solution in a numerical example.",

We prove that the associated residuals admit a canonical telescoping decomposition into rank-one terms and a limiting positive operator, and we identify this limit together with an exact energy identity expressing the defect between the initial and limiting operators as a convergent series of rank-one contributions. In the case where the iteration exhausts the operator, the residual directions form a Parseval frame for the natural range space, yielding a constructive procedure that produces Parseval frames without spectral calculus. We further solve the inverse problem by characterizing those decreasing chains with rank-one steps that arise from such dynamics via an intrinsic normalization condition involving the Moore-Penrose inverse. For trace-class operators we obtain a scalar energy identity and show that mild greedy or density conditions on the chosen directions guarantee exhaustion.

These results suggest that social reactions to epidemics may evolve according to intrinsic dynamical rules, generating complex patterns of vigilance, fatigue and renewed concern that mirror the irregular rhythms observed in real outbreaks. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating behavioural feedbacks into epidemic modeling and reveal how chaotic dynamics may arise not only from pathogens but from society itself.",

It includes both the persistence diagrams and their weak limits. Our construction generalizes persistence landscapes to a measure-theoretic setting, preserving the intrinsic structure of persistence measures. We show that this vector summary is bijective and L^1-stable under mild assumptions, and that the original measure can be uniquely reconstructed.

However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets. Numerical simulations corroborate our findings.",

In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a neural multiscale decomposition method (NeuralMD) for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1]$ from the relativistic regime to the nonrelativistic limit regime. The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schrödinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime.",

    "abstract": "Consensus optimization enables autonomous agents to solve joint tasks through peer-to-peer exchanges alone. Classical decentralized gradient descent is appealing for its minimal state but fails to achieve exact consensus with fixed stepsizes unless additional trackers or dual variables are introduced. We revisit penalty methods and introduce a decentralized two-layer framework that couples an outer penalty-continuation loop with an inner plug-and-play saddle-point solver. Any primal-dual routine that satisfies simple stationarity and communication conditions can be used; when instantiated with a proximal-gradient solver, the framework yields the DP$^2$G algorithm, which reaches exact consensus with constant stepsizes, stores only one dual residual per agent, and requires exactly two short message exchanges per inner iteration. An explicit $\\ell_1$ penalty enforces agreement and, once above a computable threshold, makes the penalized and constrained problems equivalent. Leveraging the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property, we prove global convergence, vanishing disagreement, and linear rates for strongly convex objectives under any admissible inner solver. Experiments on distributed least squares, logistic regression, and elastic-net tasks across various networks demonstrate that DP$^2$G outperforms DGD-type methods in both convergence speed and communication efficiency, is competitive with gradient-tracking approaches while using less memory, and naturally accommodates composite objectives.",

For the two-patch scenario, by treating edge behavior at the interface as a strategy, it has been shown that there exists an ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy, which is a globally evolutionarily stable strategy. Specifically, when the resident species follows the IFD strategy and the mutant species does not, the mutant species is unable to invade the resident population. Building on this foundation, our work focuses on exploring the dynamics of the system when neither species can adopt the IFD strategy. We demonstrate that if the strategies of both species either exceed or fall below the IFD strategy, the mutant species can outcompete and eliminate the resident species, provided that its strategy is closer to the IFD strategy and its diffusion rates are equal to or slower than those of the resident species. Furthermore, if the strategies of the two species lie on opposite sides of the IFD strategy, the two species can coexist. This result is further extended to the case of an arbitrary but finite number of patches.",

In this work, it is further established that, via suitably companding the ranks in ORBGRAND according to the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of channel reliability, the resulting CDF-ORBGRAND algorithm exactly achieves the mutual information of general binary-input memoryless channels under symmetric input distribution, i.e., the symmetric capacity. This result is then applied to bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems to handle high-order input constellations.

For a nonzero indeterminate $q$, the exponential distance matrix $\\mathscr{F} = (\\mathscr{F}_{ij})_{\\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{n}}$ of $G$ is defined by $\\mathscr{F}_{ij} = q^{d_{ij}},$ where $d_{ij}$ denotes the distance between vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ in $G$. A connected graph is said to be a \\emph{bi-block graph} if each of its blocks is a complete bipartite graph, possibly of varying bipartition sizes. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the determinant, inverse, and cofactor sum of the exponential distance matrix of bi-block graphs. As a consequence, some known results concerning the exponential distance matrix and the $q$-Laplacian matrix are generalized.",

The proof combines Kakutani's fixed-point theorem with a controllability/observability estimate for the associated linearized dynamics.

We shall focus especially on the p-adic case, answering some questions of basic nature, seemingly absent from the existing literature. Our methods are simple and essentially self-contained. To illustrate the issues, recall that in the complex case it follows from standard arguments that the open disk of convergence cannot contain all the branch points of x unless the series represents a rational function. In the p-adic case, we show that the analogous assertion is not true in complete generality; but we also confirm it in a number of cases, for instance under the assumption that p is not smaller than the degree of s(x) over the field of rational functions of x. In particular this gives an upper bound for the radius of convergence which has intrinsic nature. We shall also touch several related questions.",

    "abstract": "Many large-scale optimization problems arising in science and engineering are naturally defined at multiple levels of discretization or model fidelity. Multilevel methods exploit this hierarchy to accelerate convergence by combining coarse- and fine-level information, a strategy that has proven highly effective in the numerical solution of partial differential equations and related optimization problems. It turns out that many applications in PDE-constrained optimization and data science require minimizing the sum of smooth and nonsmooth functions. For example, training neural networks may require minimizing a mean squared error plus an $L^1$-regularization to induce sparsity in the weights. Correspondingly, we introduce a multilevel proximal trust-region method to minimize the sum of a nonconvex, smooth and a convex, nonsmooth function. Exploiting ideas from the multilevel literature allows us to reduce the cost of the step computation, which is a major bottleneck in single level procedures. Our work unifies theory behind the proximal trust-region methods and multilevel recursive strategies. We prove global convergence of our method in finite dimensional space and provide an efficient nonsmooth subproblem solver. We show the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm by means of numerical examples in PDE constrained optimization and machine-learning.",

We prove existence of fixed points for very general Hamiltonians. When the Hamiltonian is differentiable with respect to the momentum, we show that the evaluation curve of any such fixed point solves a continuity equation driven by a vector field associated with the final condition in the Hamilton Jacobi equation. This field is defined without requiring additional regularity conditions on the value function solving the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. The field coincides with the classical vector field of Mean Field Systems at space--differentiability points of the value function lying in the space--time regions where optimal trajectories concentrate. Our analysis therefore provides a unified framework that bridges the differential and variational viewpoints in Mean Field Games, showing how aggregate optimality conditions naturally lead to continuity-equation descriptions under the sole assumption of differentiability of the Hamiltonian in the momentum variable.",

These modifications allow us to describe two biologically relevant scenarios: a patient treated with Adoptive Cell Immunotherapy (ACI) and a patient not receiving any treatment/therapy. Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected. We analyze the equilibrium points of the homogeneous system, along with their stability and bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore, adopting the Turing approach for reaction-diffusion systems, we investigate the diffusion-driven instability and the emergence of spatial regular structures (stationary in time), i.e. the patterns. Finally, numerical simulations based on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) are presented for the two previously mentioned scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The theory of slice regular (also called hyperholomorphic) functions is a generalization of complex analysis originally given in the quaternionic framework, and then further extended to Clifford algebras, octonions, and to real alternative algebras. Recently, we have extended this theory to the case of (real) even-dimensional Euclidean space. We provided several tools for studying slice regular functions in this context, such as a path-representation formula, slice-solutions, hyper-solutions and hyper-sigma balls. When adding an algebra structure to Euclidean space we have more properties related to the possibility of multiplying elements in the algebra. In this paper, we focus on exploring the properties specific to the context of the algebra of sedenions which is rather peculiar, being the algebra non associative and non alternative. The consideration of a non alternative algebra is a novelty in the context of slice regularity which opens the way to a number of further progresses. We offer an explicit characterization for slice-solutions and hyper-solutions, and we determine the convergence domain of the power series in the form $q\\mapsto\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}(q-p)^{*n}a_n$ with sedenionic coefficients. Unlike the case of complex numbers and quaternions, the convergence domain in this context is determined by two convergence radii instead of one. These results are closely tied to the presence of zero divisors in the algebra of sedenions.",

    "abstract": "A field extension $L/K$ of characteristic $p > 0$ is formally étale if and only if the relative Frobenius of $L/K$ is an isomorphism. Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally étale property for a map $R \\to S$ of $\\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \\to S$ is formally étale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally étale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally étale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \\to S$ is b-nil formally étale. The b-nil formally étale property is quite different from the formally étale property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally étale algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally étale algebras exist over $\\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally étale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally étale implies b-nil formally étale in prime characteristic. The known cases mainly arise from the fact that a weakly étale map has isomorphic relative Frobenius. We record two additional cases that may be of interest. The first is for a map $R \\to S$ of $F$-finite rings such that $S$ has finitely presented absolute Frobenius. Secondly, we show that any formally étale map of Noetherian rings of prime characteristic is b-nil formally étale.",

    "abstract": "Latent generative models are increasingly shifting from traditional VAEs toward representation autoencoders and semantically aligned latent spaces, which lift images into higher-dimensional feature domains where semantic factors become more separable. Yet these spaces also contain geometric regularities that existing methods do not fully exploit--particularly in the directional relationships between features. We introduce a cosine-similarity-based mechanism that improves both training and sampling by selecting couplings that produce cleaner, less entangled velocity fields. This simple alignment reduces gradient noise, accelerates convergence, and improves sample fidelity. Building on this idea, we develop cosine-similarity-based fine-tuning and time-scheduling strategies that reduce the FID of an 800-epoch RAE from 11.99 to 8.60. Furthermore, by formulating an optimal-transport coupling using a cosine cost, a single-epoch fine-tuning step at the 20-epoch checkpoint reaches 3.30 FID-matching the performance of the 80-epoch baseline.",

A natural question is how toric promotion behaves under certain graph operations. In the main results of this article, we analyze the orbits of toric promotion under the bridge sum graph operation, which joins two graphs by adding an edge between a vertex of each graph. We show that the orbit length of toric promotion on any graph constructed via a bridge sum of a tree or a complete graph with a simple graph does not depend on the restriction of the initial labeling to the tree or complete subgraph. Additionally, we describe the orbit lengths of toric promotion on the bridge sums of two complete graphs and the bridge sums of a tree with a complete graph, and show that they do not depend on the initial labeling. Finally, we describe the orbit length of toric promotion on the corona product of a complete graph with any tree, and show that it does not depend on the initial labeling.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication can significantly improve bandwidth utilization in wireless systems by exploiting the meaning behind raw data. However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.",

The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting. We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\\otimes n}, Q_n^{\\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \\log(dQ_{\\infty} / dP_{\\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.",

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.",

    "abstract": "Near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) leverages distance-dependent channel variations for joint distance and angle estimation. However, full-digital architectures have prohibitive hardware costs, making hybrid analog-digital (HAD) designs the primary alternative. Nevertheless, such architectures compromise beamfocusing precision and lead to energy leakage, which exacerbates inter-user interference and increases eavesdropping risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field ISAC. For the first time, it exploits the common stream in RSMA to concurrently (i) flexibly manage interference, (ii) act as artificial noise to suppress eavesdropping, and (iii) serve as sensing sequences. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate while satisfying the angle and distance Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints. This results in a hard, non-convex optimization problem, and we employ block coordinate descent to decompose it into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. In the first stage of optimizing fully digital beamfocusers, we develop an iterative solution using weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE), quadratic transform, and Taylor expansion methods, thus avoiding conventional semidefinite relaxation. In the second and third stages, the analog and digital beamfocusers are optimized in closed form. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme (1) achieves near full-digital beamfocusing performance with a 16-fold reduction in RF chains, (2) provides superior secrecy performance compared to conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) enables high-accuracy sensing with negligible loss in secrecy performance.",

    "title": "Hybrid Beamfocusing Design for RSMA-Enhanced Near-Field Secure Communications",
    "abstract": "Near-field spherical wavefronts enable spotlight-like beam focusing to mitigate unintended energy leakage, creating new opportunities for physical-layer security (PLS). However, under hybrid analog-digital (HAD) antenna architectures, beamfocusing alone may not provide foolproof privacy protection due to reduced focusing precision. To address this issue, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field communications with fully-connected or sub-connected HAD architectures. In the proposed scheme, the common stream is designed for dual purposes, delivering the desired message for legitimate users while acting as artificial noise to disrupt eavesdropping. The primary objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the analog beamfocuser, digital beamfocuser, and common secrecy rate allocation. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Specifically, the variables are partitioned into three blocks, where one block is solved via a surrogate optimization method, while the others are updated in closed form. Simulation results reveal that our transmit scheme: (1) approaches fully digital beamfocusing with substantially fewer radio frequency chains, (2) outperforms conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) preserves secrecy without significantly compromising communication rates.",

    "abstract": "Quaternion optimization has attracted significant interest due to its broad applications, including color face recognition, video compression, and signal processing. Despite the growing literature on quadratic and matrix quaternion optimization, to the best of our knowledge, the study on quaternion polynomial optimization still remains blank. In this paper, we introduce the first investigation into this fundamental problem, and focus on the sphere-constrained homogeneous polynomial optimization over the commutative quaternion domain, which includes the best rank-one tensor approximation as a special case. Our study proposes a polynomial-time randomized approximation algorithm that employs tensor relaxation and random sampling techniques to tackle this problem. Theoretically, we prove an approximation ratio for the algorithm providing a worst-case performance guarantee",

Owing to the distribution-dependent structure and the almost periodicity of the external forcing, the resulting solution process becomes an inhomogeneous Markov process, presenting significant analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we propose sufficient conditions on the time-dependent external forcing and distribution-dependent nonlinear terms, and develop novel analytical estimates. As a result, we establish the existence and uniqueness of uniform measure attractors for the system. Notably, the joint continuity of the family of processes is achieved without relying on the Feller property of $\\{P^{(g,h)}{(\\tau,t)}\\}_{\\tau\\leq t}$.",

These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.",

The other chapters form the main contribution of this book. The intended goal is to cover the work of many researchers, in particular their discoveries from the past 25 years, trying to understand how asymptotic properties of Banach spaces are preserved under several essential notions of nonlinear (bi-Lipschitz, coarse-Lipschitz, coarse or uniform) embeddings. This is part of a broader program called the Kalton program. This program, inspired by the Ribe program, seeks to uncover purely metric characterizations of asymptotic properties of Banach spaces. Many of these charaterizations are closely connected to the geometry of families of metric graphs (trees, Hamming graphs, diamond graphs, interlacing graphs) thus this book is also about the geometric structure of those graphs.",

For a class of convex inclusions of general shapes, the construction of three-dimensional auxiliary functions -- unlike the two-dimensional case -- relies on the decay properties of solutions to a class of two-dimensional partial differential equations with singular coefficients. Taking advantage of this, we obtain pointwise upper bounds of derivatives up to the seventh order for general inclusions.

    "abstract": "Energy system optimization often relies on time series aggregation to ensure computational tractability. Aggregation generally loses the chronology of time steps, which renders the storage level representation challenging. Typically, this challenge is addressed by using representative days (RD) to utilize intra-day chronology, even though representative hours (RH) can describe the input time series more accurately at fewer representative time steps than RD. However, until now, the use of RH storage representation methods has been limited by either high computational complexity, poor accuracy in clustering and storage representation, or restricted applicability. Here, we present a novel storage representation method based on RH that combines the high accuracy of RH time series aggregation with the high computational efficiency of methods based on RD. Through benchmarking the four most established storage representation methods on a model of a net-zero European energy system, we find that the proposed method can reduce the solving time by over 95% for the same objective value compared to the most established RD and RH methods. The proposed method exhibits particular strengths at strong aggregations of around 100 to 500 representative hours per year, making the method especially applicable to large-scale and sector-coupled transition pathway models. The developed method for accurately modeling both short-term and long-term storage, along with the presented findings, is of practical relevance to energy system modelers who seek computational tractability in large-scale applications while avoiding the misallocation of storage and conversion capacities.",

The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\\partial S_{q,s}/\\partial U=1/\\vert T\\vert^{q}_{\\pm}$, which recovers $\\partial S_{BG}/\\partial U=1/T$ \\cite{Clausius1865} as $q\\rightarrow1$.",

    "abstract": "Links in practical systems, such as satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, exhibit distinct delay distributions, intermittent availability, and heterogeneous energy costs. These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, nonlinear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state-action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-ReaVI, to solve this problem. We reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) the optimal routing policy is a monotonic handover policy that adapts to the availability of routes and their mean delays; and (ii) the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy, with at most \"N choose 2 + N\" breakpoints given N routes. Numerical experiments in a satellite-terrestrial integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance, or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI.",

Continuous and jump diffusion terms in the system depend not only on the state but also on the control input, external disturbance, and mean-field components. By employing the quasi-linear technique and the method of completing the square, a mean-field stochastic jump bounded real lemma of the system is derived. This study demonstrates that the feasibility of the stochastic $H_2/H_\\infty$ control problem is equivalent to the solvability of four sets of cross-coupled generalized differential Riccati equations, which generalizes the previous results to mean-field jump-diffusion systems. To validate the proposed methodology, a numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.

    "abstract": "In reservoir computing, the coupling strength of the initial untrained recurrent neural network (the reservoir) is an important hyperparameter that can be varied for accurate training. A common heuristic is to set this parameter near the ``edge of chaos\", where the untrained reservoir is near the transition to chaotic dynamics, and the chaos can be ``tamed\". Here, we investigate how the overall connectivity strength should be varied in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks, where the firing rate is 0 below some threshold of the current and is a power function of the current above this threshold. These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.",

This study presents a novel Physics-Driven Deep Learning (PDDL) framework for modeling the complex solid-liquid phase transition in a two-dimensional PCM-based TES system integrated with finned heat exchangers. The system operates under transient forced convection with cooling air, presenting a challenging Moving Boundary Problem (MBP) characterized by intricate phase interface dynamics and strong geometrical dependencies. Conventional numerical methods for such Stefan problems face significant computational burdens due to repeated meshing requirements at the evolving interface. To overcome these limitations, we develop a multi-network PDDL approach that simultaneously predicts the solid phase temperature field, fin temperature distribution, and the moving phase boundary position. The architecture employs three specialized deep neural networks operating in parallel, constrained by the governing physical laws of energy conservation and interface conditions. Comprehensive validation against established analytical benchmarks demonstrates the framework's exceptional accuracy in predicting interface evolution and temperature distributions across various aspect ratios. The model successfully captures the parametric influence of geometrical parameter on solidification rates and thermal performance without requiring mesh regeneration. Our approach provides an efficient computational paradigm for optimizing PCM based TES systems and offers extensibility to three-dimensional configurations and multi-material composites, presenting significant potential for advanced thermal energy system design.",

To handle noisy observations, we develop a robust recovery scheme that couples our initialization with alternating least squares, achieving faster convergence and improved accuracy compared to classic methods. As applications, we obtain new algorithms for questions in other domains where tensor ring decomposition is a key primitive, namely matrix product state tomography in quantum information, and provable learning of pushforward distributions in the foundations of machine learning. These contributions advance the algorithmic foundations of TR decomposition and open new opportunities for scalable tensor network computation.",

    "abstract": "We consider a statistical model of a n-mode quantum Gaussian state which is shift invariant and also gauge invariant. Such models can be considered analogs of classical Gaussian stationary time series, parametrized by their spectral density. Defining an appropriate quantum spectral density as the parameter, we establish that the quantum Gaussian time series model is asymptotically equivalent to a classical nonlinear regression model given as a collection of independent geometric random variables. The asymptotic equivalence is established in the sense of the quantum Le Cam distance between statistical models (experiments). The geometric regression model has a further classical approximation as a certain Gaussian white noise model with a transformed quantum spectral density as signal. In this sense, the result is a quantum analog of the asymptotic equivalence of classical spectral density estimation and Gaussian white noise, which is known for Gaussian stationary time series. In a forthcoming version of this preprint, we will also identify a quantum analog of the periodogram and provide optimal parametric and nonparametric estimates of the quantum spectral density.",

For any Pitot quadrilateral \\(Q\\), we first produce a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk onto \\(Q\\), whose dilatation is the square of a Möbius automorphism determined directly by the vertices of \\(Q\\). Using this map as the Weierstrass data, we obtain a minimal graph \\(\\Sigma\\) whose Gauss map is a univalent Möbius transformation and whose height function exhibits alternating blow-up behavior along opposite sides of \\(Q\\), mirroring the classical Scherk surfaces. We further construct an associated canonical surface \\(\\Sigma^\\diamond\\), with the same boundary asymptotics, and prove a sharp curvature comparison theorem: at the harmonic center of \\(Q\\), among all bounded minimal graphs with matching normal direction and mixed derivative, \\(\\Sigma^\\diamond\\) uniquely maximizes the absolute Gaussian curvature. This provides a complete and constructive description of Scherk-type minimal graphs over all, both convex or concave, Pitot quadrilaterals.",

The plates contain small, rigid rectangular plates distributed periodically along $\\varepsilon$.

Through a simultaneous process of homogenization and dimension reduction, we obtain the limit model. Our analysis yields Korn-type inequalities adapted to the rigid-elastic geometry of the structure and provides a precise characterization of the limit deformation and displacement fields. In the $2$D limit problem, the bending is the sum of two functions, each depending on only one variable. This is due to the fact that the mixed derivatives of the outer-plane displacement vanish. Finally, the limiting 2D problem is two decoupled plates or strips, each one with just three degrees of freedom: shear along the strip axis, the cross-contraction (-extension), and the cross-bending. The corresponding correctors are defined in the same way in the periodicity cell. In the linearized setting, all the correctors are decomposed.",

Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of $p_1\\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition may exist for rank-$r$ $\\Sigma$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1<r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r>p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability. Differential geometric quantities, such as the differential of the diffeomorphism, as well as the Riemannian gradient and Hessian operator on $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ and the manifolds used in constructing $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, are also derived. Lastly, we propose a partial-isotropy core shrinkage estimator for matrix-variate data, supported by numerical illustrations.",

In some cases, the algebraic structure of such space alone is sufficiently rich to determine its topology (under some requirements on the topology). For automorphism groups, the problem of when this happens has been actively pursued over the last 40 years. With the exception of some early work of Lascar, the analogue of this problem for endomorphism monoids and polymorphism clones has only received attention in the past 15 years. In this guide, we survey the current state of affairs in this relatively young line of research.

For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/\\pi^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \\in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \\in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/\\pi^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \\in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$.",

However, there are few families of graphs whose quantum chromatic numbers are determined. A notable exception is the family of orthogonality graphs, whose quantum chromatic numbers are fully determined. In this paper, we extend these results by determining the exact quantum chromatic number of several subgraphs of the orthogonality graphs. Using the technique of combinatorial designs, we also determine the quantum chromatic number of the distance-2 Hamming graph, whose edges consist of binary vectors of Hamming distance 2, for infinitely many length.",

Our analysis adapts the Martel-Merle framework for generalized KdV equations to the nonlocal, non-integrable structure of the $b$-family of equations. The proof combines a nonlinear Liouville property for solutions localized near leftons with a refined spectral analysis of the associated linearized operator.

Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $\\beta$-expansions, and Lüroth series expansions. Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \\in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \\neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\\{2,3\\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers. A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem.",

This stands in contrast to the classical problem of statistical inference from trajectory data. We establish unique identifiability results under several key scenarios, including cases with both multiplicative and additive noise, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Our analysis leverages the intrinsic structure of the governing equations and their quantitative relationship with the ergodic measure, thereby transforming the identifiability problem into a uniqueness issue for the solutions to the associated stationary Fokker-Planck equations.

In addition, we derive the central-upwind flux for a class of nonlocal conservation laws and use an estimate on the nonlocal speed which fixes the nonlocality at the cell interfaces. We prove that the resulting first-order numerical scheme converges to the correct solution. Under additional assumptions on the analytical flux we present a similar result for a second-order central-upwind scheme. Numerical examples compare the central-upwind schemes to Godunov-type schemes and the fully-discrete scheme.",

Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \\cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional. Synthetic and real-data studies demonstrate reduced pessimism relative to DRC and improved performance over myopic DRO-Markowitz under frequent rebalancing.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a power method for computing the dominant eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian dual quaternion matrix (DQM). Although the algorithmic framework parallels the Hermitian case, the theoretical analysis is substantially more complex since a non-Hermitian dual matrix may possess no eigenvalues or infinitely many eigenvalues. Besides, its eigenvalues are not necessarily dual numbers, leading to non-commutative behavior that further complicates the analysis. We first present a sufficient condition that ensures the existence of an eigenvalue whose standard part corresponds to the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the standard part matrix. Under a stronger condition, we then establish that the sequence generated by the power method converges linearly to the strict dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors. We also verify that this condition is necessary. The key to our analysis is a new Jordan-like decomposition, which addresses a gap arising from the lack of a conventional Jordan decomposition for non-Hermitian dual matrices. Our framework readily extends to non-Hermitian dual complex and dual number matrices. We also develop an adjoint method that reformulates the eigenvalue problem into an equivalent form for dual complex matrices. Numerical experiments on non-Hermitian DQMs are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the power method.",

At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions. This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion.",

After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Mean Field Game (MFG) model for maritime traffic flow, treating the navigation of ships between seaports as a large-scale stochastic control problem. The MFG framework enables the modeling of agents at a microscopic level as rational decision-makers who seek to optimize their utility, thereby translating complex microscopic behaviors into macroscopic models. We build upon this MFG framework to develop a mesoscopic-scale MFG model that defines the payoff and cost functions for a coordinator at each seaport considered in our study. The coordinator determines the routes taken by ships transporting goods between ports by evaluating several key factors: transportation costs, expected profit margins from loading specific goods at the seaports and unloading them at various destinations, and a congestion term that reflects the costs associated with accessing the destination port. We derive an explicit solution for the stationary version of the model under certain approximations and establish conditions necessary to ensure the uniqueness of the corresponding Mean Field Equilibrium (MFE). Furthermore, we introduce a statistical methodology to infer the parameters of the game from real-world data, specifically focusing on costs and the components of expected commercial margins. To validate our model in a real-world context, we analyze the ShipFix dataset of daily ''Dry Coal'' shipments worldwide from 2015 to 2025. Our discussion highlights the influence of empirical traffic flow on various components of costs. We believe that this research represents a significant advancement in the application of MFGs for effective maritime traffic management and offers valuable insights for practitioners in the field.",

    "abstract": "Event-driven systems in fields such as neuroscience, social networks, and finance often exhibit dynamics influenced by continuously evolving external covariates. Motivated by these applications, we introduce a new class of multivariate Hawkes processes, in which the spontaneous rate of events is modulated by a diffusion process. This framework allows the point process to adapt dynamically to continuously evolving covariates, capturing both intrinsic self-excitation and external influences. In this article, we establish the probabilistic properties of the coupled process, proving stability and ergodicity under moderate assumptions. Classical functional results, including law of large numbers and mixing properties, are extended to this diffusion-driven setting. Building on these results, we study parametric inference for the Hawkes component: we derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator in the long-time regime, and derive stronger convergence results under additional assumptions on the covariate process. We further propose hypothesis testing procedures to assess the statistical relevance of the covariate. Simulation studies illustrate the validity of the asymptotic results and the effectiveness of the proposed inference methods. Overall, this work provides theoretical and practical foundations for diffusion-driven Hawkes models.",

    "title": "Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis",
    "abstract": "Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.",

    "title": "Robustness and resilience of dynamical networks in biology and epidemiology",
    "abstract": "Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.",

In this paper, inspired by a practical application in the context of a decision support system for collaborative transportation in a Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC), we mainly focus on Traveling Salesman Games (TSGs), where the objective is to allocate the cost of a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with n locations and 1 depot to n players, each linked to exactly one of the locations. Given the computational complexity of computing an element of the core and the cost of a TSP, we study semicore allocations: a relaxation of the core that only requires that the subsets of size n -1 and of size 1 do not wish to deviate from the coalition. In the literature, instances of TSGs with empty cores and semicores are found. Hence, this paper first surveys the methods to approximate stability whenever the core is empty, such as the cost of stability (computing the minimum amount of money to subsidize the coalition with to attain stability) and the $\\epsilon$-core (which is a set of allocations that allow subsets of players to exceed their actual cost, but at most of a value of $\\epsilon$).

In its quantitative form, it provides upper bounds on the decay of correlations for sufficiently smooth observables. Despite its wide applicability, determining the exact rates of mixing for a given smooth parabolic flow remains notoriously difficult. Apart from the classical horocycle flow, no examples are known where polynomial asymptotics, or sharp lower bounds, hold. In this paper, we address this question for smooth time-changes of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic surfaces. Our approach relies on a refined version of the mixing-via-shearing method which leverages on a precise description of the ergodic integrals for horocycle flows, in particular of the regularity of the coefficients appearing in their asymptotic expansions. Using this method, we prove polynomial upper bounds on the decay of correlations for smooth observables that match the optimal rates originally obtained by Ratner for the standard horocycle flow. Furthermore, in the presence of a spectral gap below $1/4$, we establish exact polynomial asymptotics, mirroring the classical behavior of the horocycle flow.",

Above the critical width, we find that the mountain pass solution is a vortex with a solitonic behaviour in the infinite direction, called a solitonic vortex. Moreover, depending on the width, we prove that the minimizer in a space with some symmetries can display one or several solitonic vortices. While the problem shares some similarities with the analysis of stability and minimality of the Ginzburg-Landau vortex of degree one in a disk or the whole plane, the change in geometry introduces subtle analytical differences.

By integrating over $v$ in velocity space $\\mathbb{R}_v^d$ (velocity averaging), one gains regularity for the density in position space $\\mathbb{R}_x^d$. The concept was invented independently by V.I. Agoshkov and by F. Golse, B. Perthame, R. Sentis and P.-L.

In \"quantum kinetic theory\", the Schrödinger equation for the complex-valued \"wave function\" in the physical space is converted into the Wigner equation for the real-valued Wigner function in phase space (which can take negative values). The Wigner (\"Quantum Vlasov\") equation contains the transport term of classical kinetic equations plus a pseudo-differential operator containing the potential. We give answers to the long standing question of whether and to which extent averaging lemmas apply to the \"quantum\" case of the Wigner equation. The hard part are the \"semi-classical\" averaging lemmas, where one considers the asymptotics of vanishing Planck constant towards the non-negative Wigner measure.

The model is formulated as a delayed-coupled hyperbolic system for bubble amplitude interactions. We combine time-domain integral equations, Laplace transforms, and Hardy-Sobolev space techniques to analyze this system, establishing its unique solvability in anisotropic Hilbert spaces, with solutions expressed as convergent Neumann series of convolution operators. We derive geometric decay of truncation errors for resonant incident waves and quantify the contribution of $N$-th order multi-scattering, showing it scales with \\(\\varepsilon^{N(1-p)+1}\\) (relating bubble radius \\(\\varepsilon\\) and inter-bubble distance scaling as $\\varepsilon^p$, $p<1$). This dominates the measurement errors, which are of order $\\varepsilon^2$, thereby allowing us to capture fields generated by inter-bubble interactions of order $N<\\frac{1}{1-p}$. This provides a quantitative relation between the spectra band width of the source field, the closeness distance between the bubbles and the order $N$ of the relevant interactions between the bubbles. Furthermore, a novel connection to Feynman diagrams maps multi-scattering paths to diagrammatic vertices and propagators, simplifying the interpretation of higher-order interactions and kinematic constraints. This framework advances accurate transient wave prediction in dispersive media, with implications for cavitation therapy, seismic imaging, and metamaterial engineering.",

Next to a straightforward scaling heuristic, we introduce a novel exact transformation approach for the preprocessing of multi-objective binary problems. In this exact approach, the large or widely ranged integer objective coefficients are transformed into the minimal integer objective coefficients that preserve the dominance relation of the points in the objective space. The transformation problem is solved with an integer programming formulation with an exponential number of constraints. We present a cutting-plane algorithm that can efficiently handle the problem size. In a first computational study, we analyze how often and in which settings the transformation actually leads to smaller coefficients. In a second study, we evaluate how the exact transformation and a typical scaling heuristic, when used as preprocessing, affect the runtime and numerical stability of the Defining Point Algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We consider a particular class of 1D aperiodic models with the aim to understand how their internal degrees of freedom contribute to their topological invariants and the possible relations (correspondences) among them. In order to handle models with finite local complexity we introduce the principle of augmentation. This allows us to relate the values of the Integrated Density of States at gap energies for the bulk system to spectral flows. We consider two different augmentations. The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant. Our approach is based on the well-established $C^*$-algebraic approach to solid state physics and the description of topological invariants by $K$-theory and cyclic cocycles. We also present numerical simulations to illustrate our theorems.",

    "abstract": "We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.",

The tree-cotree decomposition is a gauging technique to recover uniqueness when using finite elements, which consists in considering the mesh as a graph, and building a spanning tree on that graph. The idea has been recently extended to isogeometric analysis, applying the construction of the spanning tree on the control mesh, or equivalently, on the Greville grid. In the present paper we extend the construction to hierarchical splines, a set of splines with multi-level structure for adaptive refinement, by constructing a spanning tree for each single level. Since for degree $p=1$ the spaces of finite elements and hierarchical splines coincide, the presented construction is also valid for quadrilateral finite element meshes with hanging nodes. To assess the correctness of the method, we present numerical results for Maxwell eigenvalue problem.",

Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\\mathfrak b \\in [\\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals).

In so doing, we will witness how the combined use of shifted square and maximal functions causes a loss of sharpness; we, then, repair this through a trick, which allows us to remove the shift from the square functions, placing it purely on the maximal functions. As an application to our main theorem, we establish the boundedness of certain singular integrals with rough homogeneous kernels lying in the Orlicz space $L(\\log L)^\\alpha$ when restricted to the unit sphere.

To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation.

By fully leveraging temporal derivatives of physical variables within a rigorously derived compact mathematical framework, the scheme achieves fourth-order temporal accuracy in only two stages. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for A-stability is established through systematic theoretical and numerical investigation, and a Newton iterative procedure is provided to accelerate convergence.

Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.",

    "abstract": "We construct closed forms that generate with repetitions all Mersenne primes, respectively all Fermat primes, all twin-prime pairs and all Sophie Germain primes. Also, we construct closed forms that count all Mersenne primes between $0$ and $2^{n+2}-1$, respectively all Fermat primes between $0$ and $6n+5$ and all twin-prime pairs between $0$ and $n$. Every closed form is an arithmetic term, i. e. a fixed finite composition of the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with remainder and the exponentiation $2^n$. While for generating these sets with repetitions, only Wilson's Theorem is applied, for the counting forms we use more specific tests, i.e. Lucas-Lehmer, respectively Pepin, and we apply to some extent Jones' work (see Acta Arithmetica XXXV, pg. 210 - 221, 1979). To count twin primes we apply Clement's Theorem, which is closely related to Wilson's. A closed form to count the Sophie Germain primes can be constructed similarly.",

A (flat) Manin-Frobenius manifold is a flat Riemannian manifold furnished with a commutative and associative product compatible with the metric, such that a certain potentiality property is satisfied. Curved Frobenius manifolds generalize this concept to spaces with non-vanishing curvature, and they have applications in supersymmetric mechanics and within the theory of submanifolds. Curved Frobenius manifolds naturally arise from Hessian metrics, and we find that they, conceptually, are the typical non-trivial examples. We obtain that Curved Frobenius structures on constant curvature spaces are consistent with a Hessian structure, if they satisfy a closed prolongation system of finite type. Consistency means that the Frobenius potential and the Hessian potential can be identified. As an application, we show that certain second-order maximally superintegrable systems correspond 1-to-1 to Curved Frobenius structures that are consistent with a Hessian structure.",

Despite these numerous tools, few are guaranteed to preserve majoration/minoration inequalities, while this feature is fundamental in certain applications in statistics. In this paper, we focus on the integration problem arising in the estimation of moments of scalar, unnormalized, distributions. We introduce a sequential method for constructing upper and lower bounds on the sought integral. Our approach leverages the majorization-minimization framework to iteratively refine these bounds, in an enveloped principle.

We then associate this Lie algebra to a hierarchy of Hamiltonian systems with integrability properties depending on $n$, and describe their first integrals as sums of squares of linear combinations of the components of the angular momentum. In particular, we obtain that these systems are integrable for $n=2$, quasi-integrable for $n=3$, and of Poincaré-Lyapunov-Nekhoroshev type for $n\\geq4$.",

    "abstract": "Let $t$ be a positive real number. A graph is called \\emph{$t$-tough} if the removal of any vertex set $S$ that disconnects the graph leaves at most $|S|/t$ components. The toughness of a graph is the largest $t$ for which the graph is $t$-tough. A graph is minimally $t$-tough if the toughness of the graph is $t$, and the deletion of any edge from the graph decreases the toughness. Series--parallel graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices called terminals, formed recursively by two simple composition operations, series and parallel joins. They can be used to model series and parallel electric circuits. We characterize the minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graphs for all $t\\ge 1/2$. It is clear that there is no minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graph if $t>1$. We show that for $1\\ge t >1/2$, most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $t$ are minimally $t$-tough, but most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $1/2$ are not minimally $1/2$-tough.",

Informally, a set of vertices $X \\subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\\mathrm{f}\\mu^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$. This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable. Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\\mathrm{f}\\mu^{k}(G)$ and $\\omega(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\\mathrm{f}\\mu^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\\mathrm{f}\\mu^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not.

Specifically, we consider the hard- and soft-constrained formulations that have recently appeared in the literature to determine the conditions for which the two approaches are equivalent. Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Empirical results that corroborate the theoretical developments are presented and discussed throughout.",

That proof yielded bounds of tower type on the linear and quadratic complexities. It was later shown by the same authors that the quadratic complexity can be improved to logarithmic, however that proof provided no improvement on the linear component. In this paper we prove that the bound on the linear complexity can be improved to a triple exponential in the case of linear rank functions, and a quadruple exponential for polynomial rank functions of higher degree. Our strategy is based on the one developed by Gishboliner, Wigderson, and Shapira to prove the analogous result in the hypergraph setting. Step 1 is to prove a``cylinder\" version of the quadratic arithmetic regularity lemma, which says that given a set $A\\subseteq G=\\mathbb{F}_p^n$, there is a partition of $G$ into atoms of (possibly distinct) quadratic factors of high rank and bounded complexity, so that most atoms in the partition are uniform with respect to the set $A$, in the sense of a certain local $U^3$ norm. Step 2 is to show that if $A$ has bounded $\\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, then it has density near $0$ or $1$ on all atoms which are uniform in the sense of Step 1. Step 1 relies on a recent local version of the $U^3$ inverse theorem due to Prendiville, and is necessarily phrased in terms of a local $U^3$ norm implicit in that paper. On the other hand, Step 2 relies on a counting lemma for a different local $U^3$ due to Terry and Wolf, which we prove here is approximately the same as the local $U^3$ norm used in Step 1.",

Here we propose a new variational principle to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schrödinger equation, but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description of the dynamics of a physical system.",

    "abstract": "A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schrödinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincaré algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.",

    "abstract": "One of the most notable aspects of mathematical modeling is that it sheds light on the complexities arising from changes in parameters and their real-world implications, thus gaining better insight into the dynamics of economic, political, and security phenomena. Moreover, modifications to mathematical modeling will set the stage for embedding new features into the system and enriching the assessment of our analysis. In the case of the Lanchester model of warfare, the introduction of the collateral damage function was an attempt to turn the model into a more realistic framework for understanding counter-insurgencies and irregular battles. In this article, we focus on addressing the impact of sophisticated collateral damage functions in a modified Lanchester model of combat, which reflects the multifaceted nature of warfare. This analysis shows the possibility of global bifurcations and their repercussions for the combat situation between two players. Finally, we assess the codimension two bifurcation analysis of our system based on the interaction between collateral damage and the effectiveness of targeting insurgents.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel framework for estimating industrial heterogeneity by integrating maximum entropy (ME) estimation of production functions with Zonotope-based measures. Traditional production function estimations often rely on restrictive parametric models, failing to capture firm behavior under uncertainty. This research addresses these limitations by applying Hang K. Ryu's ME method to estimate production functions using World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) data from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, and India. The study normalizes entropy values to quantify heterogeneity and compares these measures with a Zonotope-based Gini index. Results demonstrate the ME method's superiority in capturing nuanced, functional heterogeneity often missed by traditional techniques. Furthermore, the study incorporates a \"Tangent Against Input Axes\" method to dynamically assess technical change within industries. By integrating information theory with production economics, this unified framework quantifies structural and functional differences across industries using firm-level data, advancing both methodological and empirical understanding of heterogeneity. A numerical simulation confirms the ME regression functions can approximate actual industrial heterogeneity. The research also highlights the superior ability of the ME method to provide a precise and economically meaningful measure of industry heterogeneity, particularly for longitudinal analyses.",

Our main contribution is a mechanically-verified proof of strong normalization for a guarded fragment using a novel triple-lexicographic measure combining a phase bit, multiset ordering (Dershowitz-Manna), and ordinal ranking. From strong normalization, we derive a certified normalizer with proven totality and soundness. Assuming local confluence (verified through critical pair analysis), Newman's Lemma yields confluence and therefore unique normal forms for the safe fragment. We establish impossibility results showing that simpler measures, such as additive counters, polynomial interpretations, and single-bit flags, provably fail for rules with term duplication. The work demonstrates fundamental limitations in termination proving for self-referential systems. We state a conjecture: no relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods. Here \"relational\" is equivalent to \"capable of ordered computation\" - systems with a recursor enabling iteration over successors, comparison, or sequential counting. Such recursors necessarily redistribute step arguments across recursive calls, defeating all additive termination measures. This structural limitation applies to any TRS expressive enough to encode ordered data. All theorems have been formally verified in a proof assistant.

Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.",

However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.",

By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations. String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.",

As $N$ grows, its samples become nearly independent, but with an increased computational cost. We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour. We also present new theoretical results regarding the i-SIR, such as the convexity of asymptotic variance in the number of proposals, which can be of independent interest.",

We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\\phi \\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.",

    "abstract": "Ranking populations such as institutions based on certain characteristics is often of interest, and these ranks are typically estimated using samples drawn from the populations. Due to sample randomness, it is important to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated ranks. This becomes crucial when latent characteristics are poorly separated and where many rank estimates may be incorrectly ordered. Understanding uncertainty can help quantify and mitigate these issues and provide a fuller picture. However, this task is especially challenging because the rank parameters are discrete and the central limit theorem does not apply to the rank estimates. In this article, we propose a Repro Samples Method to address this nontrivial inference problem by developing a confidence set for the true, unobserved population ranks. This method provides finite-sample coverage guarantees and is broadly applicable to ranking problems. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated and compared with several published large sample ranking approaches using simulation studies and real data examples involving samples both from traditional statistical models and modern data science algorithms.",

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.",

    "abstract": "Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete. The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group. When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks. The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving up-to-date information from a publicly accessible database poses significant threats to the user's privacy. {\\em Private information retrieval} (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve any entry from a database, without revealing the identity of the entry being retrieved to the server(s). Such protocols have found numerous applications in both theoretical studies and real-life scenarios. The existing PIR constructions mainly give multi-server {\\em information-theoretic} PIR (IT-PIR) protocols or single-server computational PIR (CPIR) protocols. Compared with CPIR, IT-PIR protocols are computationally more efficient and secure in the presence of unbounded servers. The most classical and challenging problem in the realm of IT-PIR is constructing protocols with lower {\\em communication complexity}. In this review, we introduce a new discrete structure called {\\em families of orthogonal arrays with span capability} (FOASC) and propose a unified framework for constructing IT-PIR protocols. We show how the most influential IT-PIR protocols in the literature can be captured by the framework. We also put forward several interesting open problems concerning FOASC, whose solutions may result in innovative IT-PIR protocols.",

    "abstract": "Sequential optimization of black-box functions from noisy evaluations has been widely studied, with Gaussian Process bandit algorithms such as GP-UCB guaranteeing no-regret in stationary settings. However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed. In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \\textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.",

Our results suggest that the task of aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as hard as the problem of aligning two graphs in polynomial time, up to logarithmic factors.

However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform.",

Using the favorable properties of competition test, the paper proposes a theorem demonstrating that this approach controls the global FDR.

However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.",

Building on this characterization, we prove two impossibility results: under either anonymity or efficiency, any such IR and IC mechanism collapses to the null mechanism, which never allocates the item to any agent. Leveraging these findings, we partially extend our analysis to a multi-item setup.

The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent {\\alpha} < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts.

    "abstract": "Cyclic structures are fundamental topological features in graphs, playing critical roles in network robustness, information flow, community structure, and various dynamic processes. Algorithmic tools that can efficiently probe and analyze these cyclic topologies are increasingly vital for tasks in graph mining, network optimization, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. A core primitive for quantitative analysis of cycles is finding the Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC), representing the shortest cyclic path in a weighted graph. However, computing the MWC efficiently remains a challenge, particularly compared to shortest path computations. This paper introduces a novel deterministic algorithm for finding the MWC in general weighted graphs. Our approach adapts the structure of Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing and minimizing a \\textit{composite distance} metric, effectively translating the global cycle search into an iterative node-centric optimization. We provide a rigorous proof of correctness based on loop invariants. We detail two mechanisms for accelerating the search: a provable node discarding technique based on intermediate results, and a highly effective graph pruning heuristic. This heuristic dynamically restricts the search to relevant subgraphs, leveraging the principle of locality often present in complex networks to achieve significant empirical speedups, while periodic resets ensure global optimality is maintained. The efficiency of the proposed MWC algorithm enables its use as a core component in more complex analyses focused on cyclic properties. We illustrate this through a detailed application case study: accelerating the computation of the Loop Modulus, a measure of cycle richness used in advanced network characterization. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the runtime of the iterative constraint-finding bottleneck in this computation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate remote state estimation is a fundamental component of many autonomous and networked dynamical systems, where multiple decision-making agents interact and communicate over shared, bandwidth-constrained channels. These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.",

Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability.

    "abstract": "The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.",

They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.",

    "abstract": "High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for quantum optical tasks. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.",

They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.",

In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models.

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram.

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.",

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.",

We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes.

However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $\\tau$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $\\sigma^2$ to $\\sigma^2/\\tau$, where $\\sigma^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.",

Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter.

    "abstract": "Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.",

    "abstract": "Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.",

This learning process, however, typically requires a large number of active interactions/iterations, which limits its practical feasibility and leads to excessive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance. Moreover, we identify the ray-tracing accuracy as the most critical factor in digital twin fidelity that impacts the learned codebook performance.",

The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.",

    "abstract": "In this article, $q$-regular sequences in the sense of Allouche and Shallit are analysed asymptotically. It is shown that the summatory function of a regular sequence can asymptotically be decomposed as a finite sum of periodic fluctuations multiplied by a scaling factor. Each of these terms corresponds to an eigenvalue of the sum of matrices of a linear representation of the sequence; only the eigenvalues of absolute value larger than the joint spectral radius of the matrices contribute terms which grow faster than the error term. The paper has a particular focus on the Fourier coefficients of the periodic fluctuations: They are expressed as residues of the corresponding Dirichlet generating function. This makes it possible to compute them in an efficient way. The asymptotic analysis deals with Mellin--Perron summations and uses two arguments to overcome convergence issues, namely Hölder regularity of the fluctuations together with a pseudo-Tauberian argument. Apart from the very general result, three examples are discussed in more detail: sequences defined as the sum of outputs written by a transducer when reading a $q$-ary expansion of the input; the amount of esthetic numbers in the first~$N$ natural numbers; and the number of odd entries in the rows of Pascal's rhombus. For these examples, very precise asymptotic formulæ are presented. In the latter two examples, prior to this analysis only rough estimates were known.",

In this paper, we consider a raceway, i.e., an oval pond where the water is set in motion by a paddle wheel. Our aim is to investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of bottom topography in such raceway ponds on microalgae growth. To achieve this goal, we consider a biological model based on the Han model, coupled with the Saint--Venant systems that model the fluid. We then formulate an optimization problem, for which we apply the weak maximum principle to characterize optimal topographies that maximize biomass production over one lap of the raceway pond or multiple laps with a paddle wheel. In contrast to a widespread belief in the field of microalgae, we show that a flat topography in a periodic regime satisfies the necessary optimality condition, and observe in the numerical experiments that the flat topography is actually optimal in this case. However, non-trivial topographies may be more advantageous in alternative scenarios, such as when considering the effects of mixing devices within the model. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between bottom topography, fluid dynamics, and microalgae growth in raceway ponds, offering valuable insights into optimizing biomass production.",

We show that for a very general $X$, projective deformations in the Shafarevich-Tate family correspond to the torsion points in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group. A sufficient condition for a Lagrangian fibration $X$ to be projective is existence of a holomorphic section. We find sufficient cohomological conditions for existence of a deformation in the Shafarevich-Tate family that admits a section.",

    "abstract": "We provide a uniform construction of \"mixed versions\" or \"graded lifts\" in the sense of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel which works for arbitrary Artin stacks. In particular, we obtain a general construction of graded lifts of many categories arising in geometric representation theory and categorified knot invariants. Our new theory associates to each Artin stack of finite type $\\mathcal{Y}$ over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ a symmetric monoidal DG-category $\\mathsf{Shv}_{\\mathsf{gr}, c}(\\mathcal{Y})$ of constructible graded sheaves on $\\mathcal{Y}$ along with the six-functor formalism, a perverse $t$-structure, and a weight (or co-$t$-)structure in the sense of Bondarko and Pauksztello, compatible with the six-functor formalism, perverse $t$-structures, and Frobenius weights on the category of (mixed) $\\ell$-adic sheaves. Classically, mixed versions were only constructed in very special cases due to the non-semisimplicity of Frobenius. Our construction sidesteps this issue by semi-simplifying the Frobenius action itself. However, the category $\\mathsf{Shv}_{\\mathsf{gr}, c}(\\mathcal{Y})$ agrees with those previously constructed when they are available. For example, for any reductive group $G$ with a fixed pair $T\\subset B$ of a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup, we have an equivalence of monoidal DG weight categories $\\mathsf{Shv}_{\\mathsf{gr}, c}(B\\backslash G/B) \\simeq \\mathsf{Ch}^b(\\mathsf{SBim}_W)$, where $\\mathsf{Ch}^b(\\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ is the monoidal $\\mathsf{DG}$-category of bounded chain complexes of Soergel bimodules and $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a triple coproduct for knots on surfaces, providing a commutative framework that decomposes a single-component diagram into three components (Section 2). This construction is motivated by the interplay between intersection theory and the affine index polynomial, and extends these ideas to a three-component setting (Section 5). Building on Turaev's cobracket theory, we define an integer-valued invariant under stable equivalence by combining the coproduct with an intersection-theoretic function (Theorem 1). Unlike classical cobrackets, which often collapse distinct local configurations, our approach preserves combinatorial traces of smoothing choices, enabling fine-grained detection of local crossing patterns (Definition 4). In the symmetric tensor setting, Reidemeister invariance uniquely determines the relations in the word space (Equations (4), (5)) and canonically fixes smoothing weights, revealing an intrinsic simplicity behind the algebraic framework (Corollary 1). This uniqueness result positions our construction as the canonical commutative analogue of Turaev's non-commutative cobracket and clarifies its interpretation as a classical limit of skein quantization, extending the theoretical scope beyond previously known invariants (Section 6). Examples demonstrate substantial distinguishing power, separating an infinite sequence of knots arising from distinct smoothing choices and broadening the reach of existing invariants (Proposition 2).",

    "abstract": "Sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA) is a cardinal technique for obtaining combinations of features, or principal components (PCs), that explain the variance of high-dimensional datasets in an interpretable manner. This involves solving a sparsity and orthogonality constrained convex maximization problem, which is extremely computationally challenging. Most existing works address sparse PCA via methods-such as iteratively computing one sparse PC and deflating the covariance matrix-that do not guarantee the orthogonality, let alone the optimality, of the resulting solution when we seek multiple mutually orthogonal PCs. We challenge this status by reformulating the orthogonality conditions as rank constraints and optimizing over the sparsity and rank constraints simultaneously. We design tight semidefinite relaxations to supply high-quality upper bounds, which we strengthen via additional second-order cone inequalities when each PC's individual sparsity is specified. Further, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the maximum amount of variance explained as a function of the support. We exploit these relaxations and bounds to propose exact methods and rounding mechanisms that, together, obtain solutions with a bound gap on the order of 0%-15% for real-world datasets with p = 100s or 1000s of features and r \\in {2, 3} components. Numerically, our algorithms match (and sometimes surpass) the best performing methods in terms of fraction of variance explained and systematically return PCs that are sparse and orthogonal. In contrast, we find that existing methods like deflation return solutions that violate the orthogonality constraints, even when the data is generated according to sparse orthogonal PCs. Altogether, our approach solves sparse PCA problems with multiple components to certifiable (near) optimality in a practically tractable fashion.",

We provide an affirmative answer by proposing the Accelerated Constrained Gradient Descent (ACGD) method, a single-loop algorithm that modifies AGD by replacing the descent step with a constrained descent step, adding only a few linear constraints to the prox mapping. ACGD achieves nearly the same oracle complexity as minimizing the optimal Lagrangian function (with the multiplier fixed at its optimal value). We establish matching lower bounds, demonstrating these complexity results are unimprovable. For large-scale problems with many constraints, we introduce ACGD-S, which replaces the computationally demanding constrained descent step with basic matrix-vector multiplications, maintaining optimal oracle and computation complexities. Together, these methods provide a nearly complete characterization of the hardness of smooth function-constrained optimization. We also propose parameter-free adaptive versions that achieve optimal oracle complexity (requiring only the strong convexity modulus) and present encouraging numerical results demonstrating their efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The power operation of continuous Archimedean triangular norms (t-norms) is fundamental for generalizing the multiplication and power operations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) within the framework of continuous Archimedean t-norms. However, due to the lack of systematic research on the power operation of general continuous t-norms in theory, it greatly limits the further generalization of the multiplication and power operations for IFSs via general continuous t-norms. This paper aims to investigate the power operation of continuous t-norms and develop some IF information aggregation methods. In theory, it is proved that a continuous t-norm is power stable if and only if every point is a power stable point, and if and only if it is the minimum t-norm, or it is strict, or it is an ordinal sum of strict t-norms. Moreover, the representation theorem of continuous t-norms is used to obtain the computational formula for the power of continuous t-norms. Based on the power operation of t-norms, four fundamental operations induced by a continuous t-norm for the IFSs are introduced. Furthermore, various IF aggregation operators based on these four fundamental operations, namely the IF weighted average (IFWA), IF weighted geometric (IFWG), and IF mean weighted average and geometric (IFMWAG) operators, are defined, and their properties are analyzed. In application, a new decision-making algorithm is designed based on the IFMWAG operator, which can remove the hindrance of indiscernibility on the boundaries of some classical aggregation operators. The practical applicability, comparative analysis, and advantages of the study with other decision-making methods are furnished to ascertain the efficacy of the designed method.",

For certain composite-type problems and nonlinear programs (for which explicit representations of the generalized Jacobians of the associated stationarity equations are available), such regularity assumptions are closely connected to strong second-order sufficient conditions. However, general characterizations are not well understood. In this paper, we investigate a strong second-order sufficient condition ($\\mathrm{SSOSC}$) for composite problems whose nonsmooth part has a generalized conic-quadratic second subderivative. We discuss the relationship between the $\\mathrm{SSOSC}$ and other second order-type conditions that involve the generalized Jacobians of the normal map. In particular, these two conditions are equivalent under certain structural assumptions on the generalized Jacobian matrix of the proximity operator. Leveraging second-order variational techniques and properties, we then verify that the introduced structural conditions hold for a broad class of $C^2$-strictly decomposable functions. Finally, it is shown that the $\\mathrm{SSOSC}$ is further equivalent to the strong metric regularity of the subdifferential, the normal map, and the natural residual.",

A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. The parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\\uı functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. So the unknowns of our LTDS can be computed by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.",

The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279 , arXiv 2311.09151 ] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media.

We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.",

We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the Hénon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "The negative binomial distribution has been widely used as a more flexible model than the Poisson distribution for count data. However, when the true data-generating process is Poisson, it is often challenging to distinguish it from a negative binomial distribution with extreme parameter values, and existing maximum likelihood estimation procedures for the negative binomial distribution may fail or produce unstable estimates. To address this issue, we develop a new algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of negative binomial parameters, which is more efficient and more accurate than existing methods. We further extend negative binomial distributions with a new parameterization to cover Poisson distributions as a special class. We provide theoretical justifications showing that, when applied to a Poisson data, the estimated parameters of the extended negative binomial distribution can consistently recover the true Poisson distribution.",

    "abstract": "We propose an autoregressive framework for modelling dynamic networks with dependent edges. It encompasses models that accommodate, for example, transitivity, degree heterogenenity, and other stylized features often observed in real network data. By assuming the edges of networks at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in a straightforward manner. Due to the possibly large number of parameters in the models, the natural MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration employing projection, which mitigates the impact of the other parameters (Chang et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2023). Leveraging a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the assumption of stationarity. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, although it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions. Illustration with a transitivity model was carried out in both simulation and a real network data set.",

In this paper, we focus on the latter approach and demonstrate its efficiency gain from parallelization. For tree-structured MOT problems, we introduce a novel parallelizable algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. Additionally, we adapt this algorithm for general graphs, employing the modified junction trees to enable parallel updates.

    "abstract": "Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. This condition is stricter than that of the vanishing error regime, where the error probability goes to zero as the code blocklength goes to infinity. In general, zero-error coding is an open combinatorial question. We investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding problem with side information and the channel coding problem. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the probability distribution decomposes into a product of probability distributions. A crucial step is the additivity property of the optimal rate, which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. When the additivity holds, the concatenation of optimal codes is optimal. We derive a condition under which the additivity of the complementary graph entropy $\\overline{H}$ for the AND product of graphs and for the disjoint union of graphs are equivalent. Then we establish the connection with a recent result obtained by Wigderson and Zuiddam and by Schrijver, for the zero-error capacity $C_0$. As a consequence, we provide new single-letter characterizations of $\\overline{H}$ and $C_0$, for example when the graph is a product of perfect graphs, which is not perfect in general, and for the class of graphs obtained by the product of a perfect graph $G$ with the pentagon graph $C_5$. By building on Haemers result for $C_0$, we also show that the additivity of $\\overline{H}$ does not hold for the product of the Schläfli graph with its complementary graph.",

The $\\sigma$-fields of this largest extension constitute the completion, in the sense of noise-type Boolean algebras, of the range of the unextended (basic) noise. The basic noise extends to a given measurable domain precisely when a certain stability property is met: the times at which a Brownian motion has local maxima which fall inside the domain must remain unaffected under resampling of the Brownian increments outside the domain; together with the same being true for the complement of the domain. A set that is equal to an open set modulo a Lebesgue negligible one, with the same holding of its complement, has this stability property, but others have it too: the extension is non-trivial. Some domains are totally unstable with respect to the indicated resampling, and to them the extension cannot be made.",

Through analytical and numerical results, we compare the performance of QVAoI-Optimal, QAoI-Optimal, VoI-Optimal, and AoI-Optimal policies with a baseline greedy policy. All semantics-aware policies show significantly improved performance compared to the greedy policy. The QVAoI-Optimal policy, in particular, demonstrates a significant performance improvement by either providing fresher, more relevant, and valuable updates with the same amount of energy arrivals or reducing the number of transmissions in the system to maintain the same level of freshness and significance of information compared to the QAoI-Optimal and other policies.",

Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

    "abstract": "Reaction networks are a general framework widely used in modeling diverse phenomena in different science disciplines. The dynamical process of a reaction network endowed with mass-action kinetics is a mass-action system as an ODE defined by a directed graph, the so-called ``reaction graph''. Endotacticity is a graph property used to study persistence and permanence of mass-action systems. In this paper, we provide a detailed characterization of first order endotactic reaction graphs. Besides, we provide a sufficient condition for endotacticity of reaction networks which are not necessarily of first order. Such a characterization of a first order endotactic reaction graph yields the spectral property of the adjacency matrix of the reaction graph. As a consequence, we prove that every first order endotactic mass-action system as a linear ODE has a weakly reversible deficiency zero realization, and has a unique equilibrium which is exponentially globally asymptotically stable (and is positive) in each (positive) stoichiometric compatibility class. Using a stability result for asymptotically autonomous differential equations, examples are constructed to illustrate that the global stability results can be extended to mass-action systems of higher order reaction networks modeled by nonlinear ODEs, which are not necessarily endotactic. Different from the classical approaches for proving global asymptotic stability, the proof does not rely on the construction of a Lyapunov function. This paper may serve as a starting point of characterizing endotactic reaction graphs of higher orders and studying global stability of mass-action systems in general.",

In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort.

    "abstract": "We consider the convergence of the ESD for non-Hermitian random band matrices with independent entries to the circular law, which is the uniform measure on the unit disk in the center of the complex plane. We assume that the bandwidth of the matrix scales like $n^\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma\\in(0,1]$, where $n$ is the matrix size, and the variance profile of the matrix is only assumed to be doubly stochastic with no additional assumption on its specific mixing properties. We prove that the circular law limit holds either (1) when $\\gamma>\\frac{5}{6}$ and the entries are independent Gaussians, (2) or when $\\gamma>\\frac{8}{9}$ and the entries are independent subgaussian random variables. This new threshold improves the previous threshold $\\gamma>\\frac{32}{33}$ which was only proven for block band matrices and periodic band matrices. After the initial version of this paper, the author further extended the range of circular law for much smaller values of $\\gamma$ in 2508.18143 and 2511.01744 when the variance profile has specific mixing properties, but not for an arbitrary doubly stochastic variance profile. Thus the main contribution of this paper is the circular law for a genuine power law bandwidth for any doubly stochastic variance profile. We also prove an extended form of product circular law with a growing number of matrices. Weak delocalization estimates on eigenvectors are also derived. The new technical input is new polynomial lower bounds on some intermediate small singular values, and this estimate does not depend on the specific structure of the variance profile beyond the fact that it is doubly stochastic.",

The second method employs a projected regular two-parameter eigenvalue problem to compute either all eigenvalues or only a subset of eigenvalues close to a given target. The third approach is a locally convergent Gauss--Newton-type method that computes a single 2D point from an inital approximation, the later can be provided for all 2D points via the method of fixed relative distance by Jarlebring, Kvaal, and Michiels.

This paper establishes the sufficient and necessary relationship between the exact support recovery and the optimal minimum signal conditions in the double sparse model. Specifically, sharply under the proposed signal conditions, a two-stage double sparse iterative hard thresholding procedure achieves exact support recovery with a suitably chosen threshold parameter. Also, this procedure maintains asymptotic normality aligning with an OLS estimator given true support, hence holding the oracle properties. Conversely, we prove that no method can achieve exact support recovery if these signal conditions are violated. This fills a critical gap in the minimax optimality theory on support recovery of the double sparse model. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.",

Our approach (i) accounts for multiple performance objectives, such as those that maximize the uninterrupted volume of traffic between different origin-destination pairs in a transportation network, (ii) uses methods of probabilistic risk assessment to quantify the expected performance of the network with regard to these objectives, and (iii) uses a search algorithm combined with an optimization model to identify those combinations of fortification actions that are cost-efficient in improving the performance of the network, given the available, possibly partial information about the relative importance of objectives and minimum performance requirements on them.

However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.",

    "title": "Social Optimization in Noncooperative Games under Central Regulation",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the increasing attention to overall social benefits in networked multi-agent systems, this paper investigates an optimization problem building on noncooperative games under high-level regulation, which can be formulated in a bilevel structure. Specifically, the low level consists of a noncooperative game, where each player competes to minimize its own cost function that depends not only on the strategies of all players, but also on an intervention decision of a regulator located at the high level. Under the intervention of the high-level regulator, the low-level players aim to seek a Nash equilibrium (NE), which indeed is related to the regulator's decision. Meanwhile, the regulator in the high level attempts to achieve the social optimum, that is, to minimize the sum of all players' costs obtained at the NE. This bilevel social optimization problem is proven to be nonconvex and nonsmooth, leading to challenges for solving it effectively, as the exact gradient of cost sum functions may not be available. To address this intricate problem, an inexact zeroth-order algorithm is developed by virtue of the smoothing techniques, allowing for approximating the NE of the low-level game and thus estimating the required gradients. It is rigorously shown that the devised algorithm achieves a sublinear convergence rate for computing an approximate stationary point of the studied problem. Moreover, the sublinear convergence rate in the scenario where the exact equilibrium of the low-level game is available is established. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of theoretical findings.",

The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been a useful tool for approximate reasoning. The encoding method is an important approach to formally model $AF$s under related semantics. The aim of this paper is to develop the encoding method from classical Dung's $AF$s ($DAF$s) to $AF$s with set attackers ($AFSA$s) including higher-level argumentation frames ($HLAF$s), Barringer's higher-order $AF$s ($BHAF$s), frameworks with sets of attacking arguments ($SETAF$s) and higher-order set $AF$s ($HSAF$s). Regarding syntactic structures, we propose the $HSAF$s where the target of an attack is either an argument or an attack and the sources are sets of arguments and attacks. Regarding semantics, we translate $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s under respective complete semantics to Łukasiewicz's 3-valued propositional logic system ($PL_3^L$). Furthermore, we propose complete semantics of $BHAF$s and $HSAF$s by respectively generalizing from $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s, and then translate to the $PL_3^L$. Moreover, for numerical semantics of $AFSA$s, we propose the equational semantics and translate to fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}$s). This paper establishes relationships of model equivalence between an $AFSA$ under a given semantics and the encoded formula in a related propositional logic system ($PLS$). By connections of $AFSA$s and $PLS$s, this paper provides the logical foundations for $AFSA$s associated with complete semantics and equational semantics. The results advance the argumentation theory by unifying $HOAF$s and $SETAF$s under logical formalisms, paving the way for automated reasoning tools in AI, decision support, and multi-agent systems.",

In both cases, large-time convergence to a monokinetic final state is demonstrated.

When the initial particle distribution is suitably small, then the convergence rate becomes exponential, a result consistent with the work of Han-Kwan et al.

Furthermore, we introduce elementary operations on relations, which are less cumbersome than general formulas and have many useful properties. Using these tools, we provide a new and elementary proof of the famous Post's lattice theorem.

In order to improve the managing ability on undesired harmonic signals and the diversity of frequency offsets, this paper presents a novel multi-subarray FD-RIS framework. In this framework, the RIS is evenly divided into multiple subarrays, each employing a distinct time-modulation frequency to enable the diversity of frequency offsets. Additionally, to suppress the undesired harmonic signals, a new time-modulation technique is employed to periodically adjust the phase-shift of each element. Based on the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS, the signal processing model is first analytically derived. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS, we integrate it into a multi-user communication scenario and formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, time delays, and modulation frequencies. Subsequently, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed to effectively solve this problem with low computing complexity. To evaluate the beamforming capability of the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS,three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations among users are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-subarray FD-RIS can significantly enhance and sustain the performance of communication networks by leveraging unique distance-angle beamforming, even when users share the same angular position where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation.",

    "abstract": "This paper contributes to the compactification approach to study mean-field control problems with Poissonian common noise. To overcome the lack of compactness and continuity issues caused by common noise, we exploit the point process representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and propose a pathwise formulation in a two-step procedure by freezing a sample path of the common noise. In the first step, we establish the existence of the optimal relaxed control in the pathwise formulation as if common noise is absent, but with finite deterministic jumping times. The second step plays the key role in our approach, which is to aggregate the optimal solutions in the pathwise formulation over all sample paths of common noise and show that it yields an optimal solution in the original model. To this end, with the help of concatenation techniques, we first develop a pathwise superposition principle in the model with deterministic jumping times, drawing a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control problem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem. As a result, we can further bridge the equivalence among different problem formulations and verify that the constructed solution under aggregation is indeed optimal in the original problem. We also extend the methodology to solve mean-field games with Poissonian common noise, confirming the existence of a strong mean field equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "The von Neumann equation with power nonlinearity serves as a statistical model for nonlinear waves, and it exhibits a bifurcation between stable and unstable regimes. In ocean waves it is known as the Alber equation, and its bifurcation is considered important for understanding rogue waves, a key problem in marine safety. Despite this, only one first-order-in-time numerical method exists in the literature for its simulation. In this paper, we introduce a structure-preserving, linearly implicit, second-order-in-time scheme for its numerical solution. We employ fourth-order finite differences in space, allowing for much larger and faster simulations. As an illustrative example, we explore the onset of modulation instability. We verify that the linear stability analysis accurately predicts the initial growth phase, but find that it fails to forecast the maximum amplitude or the formation of a coherent structure in the nonlinear regime. Monte Carlo simulations with Gaussian background spectra reveal that the maximum amplitude depends solely on the homogeneous background, and not on the initial inhomogeneity. For weak instabilities, the inhomogeneity grows substantially from its initial condition, but it remains small compared to the background. On the other hand, past a critical threshold, the instability grows to yield dominant effects. Thus, beyond the onset of linear instability, the solution of the fully nonlinear problem presents a second bifurcation -- at the point which inhomogeneous features become dominant compared to the background.",

Our approach is local, analytic, and constructive: we view $\\mathbb{C}H^2$ through its solvable Lie group model and express the conformal Killing equation as an explicit system of partial differential equations. By solving this system completely, we show that any conformal vector field must be determined by a Killing field. The analysis in complex dimension $2$ naturally extends to arbitrary $n$, yielding a unified and fully explicit proof of this rigidity phenomenon.",

The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a total Lagrangian mixed Petrov-Galerkin finite element formulation that provides a computationally efficient approach for analyzing Cosserat rods that is free of singularities and locking. To achieve a singularity-free orientation parametrization of the rod, the nodal kinematical unknowns are defined as the nodal centerline positions and unit quaternions. We apply Lagrange interpolation to all nodal kinematic coordinates, and in combination with a projection of non-unit quaternions, this leads to an interpolation with orthonormal cross-section-fixed bases. To eliminate locking effects such as shear locking, the variational Hellinger-Reissner principle is applied, resulting in a mixed approach with additional fields composed of resultant contact forces and moments. Since the mixed formulation contains the constitutive law in compliance form, it naturally incorporates constrained theories, such as the Kirchhoff-Love theory. This study specifically examines the influence of the additional internal force fields on the numerical performance, including locking mitigation and robustness. Using well-established benchmark examples, the method demonstrates enhanced computational robustness and efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in required load steps and iterations when applying the standard Newton-Raphson method.",

    "title": "Symbiotic Backscatter Communication: A Design Perspective on the Modulation Scheme of Backscatter Devices",
    "abstract": "Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs) modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate, especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the backscatter link in SBC.",

This settles the matroid equitability conjecture by Fekete and Szabó (Electron. J. Comb. 2011) in the affirmative. We also investigate equitable splittings of two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, and show that there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections with $S_1$ may differ by at most one and the sizes of the intersections with $S_2$ may differ by at most two; this is the best one can hope for arbitrary matroids. We also derive applications of this result into matroid constrained fair division problems. We show that there exists a matroid-constrained fair division that is envy-free up to one item if the valuations are identical and tri-valued additive. We also show that for bi-valued additive valuations, there exists a matroid-constrained allocation that provides everyone their maximin share.",

The first two algorithms adopt a sequential strategy: at the initial time step, all variables are computed simultaneously using a monolithic solver; thereafter, the system is split into a mixed linear elasticity subproblem and a coupled pressure-temperature reaction-diffusion subproblem. The two variants differ in the order in which these subproblems are solved. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce a parallel semidecoupled algorithm. In this approach, the four-field system is solved monolithically only at the first time step, and the two subproblems are then solved in parallel at subsequent time levels. None of the three algorithms requires iterative procedures at each time step, and are free from stabilization. Rigorous analysis confirms their unconditional stability, optimal convergence rates, and robustness under a wide range of physical parameter settings. These theoretical results are further validated by numerical experiments.",

In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.",

Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t>0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.",

This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we answer the challenge. We use $q$-series algebra, first-order $q$-differential systems, and analytic continuation with monodromy to give a criterion that decides when such series are modular.

Our first main result shows that, assuming convergence of the associated covariance operators in the trace-class norm, a sequence lying in a fixed Wiener-Itô chaos converges in distribution if and only if its fourth weak moments converge to the corresponding Gaussian moments. For general sequences with infinite chaos expansions, we derive analogous sufficient conditions for convergence in distribution. A key ingredient in our approach is a Stein-Malliavin bound formulated with respect to a distance that metrizes weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. The results are infinite-dimensional extensions of the classical real-valued Fourth-Moment Theorem of Nualart and Peccati [Ann. Probab. 33, 177-193 (2005)]. Our work builds upon the work by Bourguin and Campese [Electron. J. Probab. 25, 1-30 (2020)] who claimed a Fourth-Moment Theorem in separable Hilbert spaces. However, a recent work by Bassetti, Bourguin, Campese, and Peccati [ arXiv:2509.13427 (2025)] showed that the distance employed in the former article does not metrize weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the conditions stated in Bourguin and Campese are not sufficient to recover a valid Fourth-Moment Theorem in the Hilbert-space setting.",

    "abstract": "Semi-free ideal rings, or semifirs, were introduced by Paul M. Cohn to study universal localizations in the non-commutative setting. We provide new examples of semifirs consisting of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables. These examples arise canonically in free analysis by completing the free algebra in the topology of ``uniform convergence on operator-space balls'' in the non-commutative universe of tuples of square matrices of any finite size. We show, in particular, that the ring of (uniformly) entire non-commutative (NC) functions in $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ non-commuting variables, $\\scr{O}_d$, is a semifir. Every finitely--generated right (or left) ideal in $\\scr{O}_d$ is closed, which yields an analytic extension of G. Bergman's nullstellensatz for the free algebra. Any semifir admits a universal skew field of fractions; applying this to $\\scr{O}_d$ yields the universal skew field of ``NC meromorphic expressions\", $\\scr{M} _d$. We show that any $f \\in \\scr{M} _d$ has a well-defined domain and evaluations in a large class of stably-finite topological algebras, including finite $C^*$-algebras, extending a result of Cohn for NC rational functions. As an application, we extend the almost sure convergence result of Haagerup and Thorbjörnsen for free polynomials evaluated on tuples of random matrices to the setting of NC meromorphic expressions.",

    "abstract": "Many problems can be formulated as high-dimensional integrals of discontinuous functions that exhibit significant boundary growth, challenging the error analysis and applications of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods. This paper studies RQMC methods for super-fast growing functions satisfying generalized exponential growth conditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, by combining RQMC with importance sampling (IS), we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands, whose values and derivatives are bounded by the critical growth function $e^{A|\\boldsymbol{x}|^2}$ with $A = 1/2$. This result extends the existing results in the literature, which are limited to the case $A < 1/2$. We demonstrate that by imposing a light-tailed condition on the proposal distribution of IS, RQMC can achieve an error rate of $O(n^{-1 + \\epsilon})$ with a sample size n and an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon >0$. Second, we verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling (ODIS) satisfy the required light-tailed condition, providing a rigorous theoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for discontinuous integrands from finance, we prove that the integrands after preintegration satisfy the exponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated functions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS framework. Numerical experiments on financial derivative pricing validate our theory, showing that the RQMC-IS with preintegration is effective in handling problems with discontinuous payoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates.",

The example of the Bohr topology on the real line demonstrates that metrizability is an essential assumption in our first claim.

Within this geometry, one can define difference-angle triangles, norms, bisectors, perpendiculars, and inner products. Several characteristic properties not seen in existing geometries emerge, together with behaviors analogous to those in Euclidean geometry: the triangle inequality always holds with equality, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $0$, and a Miquel point exists even for parabolas. In particular, the concurrency of the parabolic Miquel configuration was suggested by Weiss and Odehnal, and our main theorem provides the first explicit and rigorous confirmation of this assertion. We also point out that many classical Euclidean configurations (including Brocard-type configurations) naturally reappear in the setting of difference-angle geometry. These results indicate that difference-angle geometry is a promising candidate for a ``Fourth Geometry'' following the Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries.",

Meanwhile, we present the degenerate cases of the aforementioned results, which are constructed using special closure operators and t-subnorms. Some of these cases correspond to well-known results documented in the literature. Moreover, the dual constructions of uninorms on bounded lattices, based on t-norms, interior operators and t-superconorms, are presented simultaneously.",

We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution.

From this we derive the distance minimizing paths which are left or right translations of one-parameter groups (though these are not the unique minizing paths if the norm is not smooth or strictly convex). Then we introduce a notion of sectional curvature $sec(\\pi)$ for a bi-invariant distance, following Milnor's ideas, and we show that this curvature is bounded and non-negative, and it is null when the $2$-plane $\\pi$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra of $Lie(G)$. We show that when the distance is strictly convex, our sectional curvature vanishes if and only if the $2$-plane is abelian.

The estimator scales favorably in moderately high dimensions ($d = 10$--$40$) and shows particular robustness to correlated or skewed distributions.

Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , $\\sqsubseteq$ is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$, the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$. This paper has solved this problem completely.

    "abstract": "The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.",

The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.",

This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\\liminf a_n, \\limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions both as the only block subspace and as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.",

We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.",

Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations.

    "title": "Achieving Linear Speedup with ProxSkip in Distributed Stochastic Optimization",
    "abstract": "The ProxSkip algorithm for distributed optimization is gaining increasing attention due to its effectiveness in reducing communication. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and fail to achieve linear speedup with respect to the number of nodes. Key questions regarding its behavior in the non-convex setting and the achievability of linear speedup remain open. In this paper, we revisit ProxSkip and address both questions. We provide a comprehensive analysis for stochastic non-convex, convex, and strongly convex problems, revealing the effects of gradient noise, local updates, network connectivity, and data heterogeneity on its convergence. We prove that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup across all three settings, and can further achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we show that properly increasing local updates effectively reduces communication complexity.",

Recent contributions have established existence and uniqueness for the optimal martingale under finite second moment assumptions on the marginals, but numerical methods exist only in the one-dimensional setting. We introduce an iterative scheme, a martingale analogue of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm, and prove its convergence in arbitrary dimension under minimal assumptions. In particular, we show that convergence holds when the marginals have finite moments of order $p > 1$, thereby extending the known theory beyond the finite-second-moment regime. The proof relies on a strict descent property for the dual value of the martingale Benamou--Brenier problem. While the descent property admits a direct verification in the case of compactly supported marginals, obtaining uniform control on the iterates without assuming compact support is substantially more delicate and constitutes the main technical challenge.",

    "abstract": "Information is typically understood as a structure that tells something about another structure, yet no widely accepted definition of information has been derived from first physical principles. Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.",

    "abstract": "Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust against partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, when the model is misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, such as careless respondents. To this end, the estimator minimizes a robust loss function based on the divergence between observed frequencies and theoretical frequencies implied by the polychoric model. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation, is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed, and comes at no additional computational cost. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.",

We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques. In certain cases, our algorithms achieve super-quadratic speedups compared to the best known classical algorithms with rigorously established runtimes.",

We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant. This huge variety of critical points makes these scenarios phenomenologically rich, and naturally suggests that such scenarios can be viewed as viable and potential alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.",

In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

    "abstract": "To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability.

That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets. We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.

    "abstract": "A key computational question underpinning the automated testing and verification of concurrent programs is the consistency question - given a partial execution history, can it be completed in a consistent manner? Due to its importance, consistency testing has been studied extensively for memory models, as well as for database isolation levels. A common theme in all these settings is the use of shared-memory as the primal mode of interthread communication. On the other hand, modern programming languages, such as Go, Rust and Kotlin, advocate a paradigm shift towards channel-based (i.e., message-passing) communication. However, the consistency question for channel-based concurrency is currently poorly understood. In this paper we lift the study of fundamental consistency problems to channels, taking into account various input parameters, such as the number of threads executing, the number of channels, and the channel capacities. We draw a rich complexity landscape, including upper bounds that become polynomial when certain input parameters are fixed, as well as hardness lower bounds. Our upper bounds are based on algorithms that can drive the verification of channel consistency in automated verification tools. Our lower bounds characterize minimal input parameters that are sufficient for hardness to arise, and thus shed light on the intricacies of testing channel-based concurrency. In combination, our upper and lower bounds characterize the boundary of tractability/intractability of verifying channel consistency, and imply that our algorithms are often (nearly) optimal.",

As a key application, we specialize to generative priors, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a latent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample complexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing the efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on deterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random sampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is determined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of $\\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in Bayesian recovery as well.

In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models (SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally, we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.",

We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.",

    "title": "Overfitting has a limitation: a model-independent generalization gap bound based on Rényi entropy",
    "abstract": "Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization gap, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization gap behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization gap applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the Rényi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization gap can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's Rényi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the Rényi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.",

This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: this https URL .",

However, their reliance on fixed nonlinear transformations - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or complex real-world data. Furthermore, these methods also exhibit poor scalability in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during optimization. We propose a data-adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike standard NVAR and RC models, the MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities, while preserving a simple readout structure and improving scalability. Initial experiments across multiple chaotic systems, tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions, showed that the adaptive model outperformed in predictive accuracy the standard NVAR, a leaky echo state network (ESN) - the most common RC model - and a hybrid ESN, thereby showing robust forecasting under noisy conditions.",

The method uses heat kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures that capture the structure of diverse medical data. The framework is presented through the heat kernel distance (HKD) transformation, which has convergence guarantees. Two algorithms have been developed: The first, Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC), is used for central analysis. The second, Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC), is used for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals. FedHK-MVFC uses differential privacy and secure aggregation to enable HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic cardiovascular patient datasets demonstrate increased clustering accuracy, reduced communication, and retained efficiency compared to centralized methods. After being validated on 10,000 synthetic patient records across two hospitals, the methods proved useful for collaborative phenotyping involving electrocardiogram (ECG) data, cardiac imaging data, and behavioral data. The proposed methods' theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. These contributions establish a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, translating advanced mathematics into practical solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring rigor and clinical relevance.",

We show that the information stored in an unconditional diffusion model captures, in part, the joint correlation between the components of the data variable $X$. Conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. The latter is only a small fraction of the total information in the neural network if the data is low-dimensional. We examine why this does not hinder conditional generation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). This expression uncovers a fundamental property of the loss landscape of depth-2 matrix factorization problems: a minimum is flat if and only if it is spectral-norm balanced, which implies that flat minima are not necessarily Frobenius-norm balanced. Furthermore, to complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.",

We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across four domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, operations research, and LLM reasoning, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.",

This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the LSFD, by allowing each access point (AP) to calculate interference-suppressing local weights independently and apply them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) frameworks, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each AP adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency (SE) optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in the PFZF and PWPFZF schemes. To enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The closed-form SE expressions corresponding to the proposed schemes are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overheads and computation costs with lower performance penalty compared to them.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the interaction strength between the nodes of a network based on dependent binary observations residing on these nodes, generated from a Markov Random Field (MRF). Since these observations can possibly be corrupted/noisy in larger networks in practice, it is important to robustly estimate the parameters of the underlying true MRF to account for such inherent contamination in observed data. However, it is well-known that classical likelihood and pseudolikelihood based approaches are highly sensitive to even a small amount of data contamination. So, in this paper, we propose a density power divergence (DPD) based robust generalization of the computationally efficient maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimator of the interaction strength parameter, and derive its rate of consistency under the pure model. Along the way, we establish consistency and asymptotics for a class of general $Z$-estimators, covering our proposed DPD based estimators, under flexible assumptions that hold for a substantial class of standard models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first central limit theorems for the class of general $Z$-estimators in such settings. Moreover, we show that the gross error sensitivities of the proposed DPD based estimators are significantly smaller than that of the MPL estimator, thereby theoretically justifying the greater (local) robustness of the former under contaminated settings. Finally, we demonstrate the superior (finite sample) performance of the DPD based variants over the traditional MPL estimator in a number of synthetically generated contaminated network datasets, and apply them to learn the network interaction strength in several real datasets from diverse domains of social science, neurobiology and genomics.",

The proposed AMS framework reformulates the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events and is applied under both Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics. Numerical experiments cover European, Asian, and up-and-in barrier digital options, together with a multidimensional digital payoff designed as a stress test. Across all contracts, AMS achieves substantial gains, reaching up to 200-fold improvements over standard Monte Carlo, while preserving unbiasedness and showing robust performance with respect to the choice of importance function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of AMS to derivative pricing.

The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop. The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\\text{pert}}[C]\\, e^{-\\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \\ge \\sqrt{2}\\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement. The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \\in H^{1/2}(\\mathbb{S}^1,\\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\\kappa \\sim \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections.

    "abstract": "Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\\eta>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\\rho_k^\\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\\eta$. We show that $\\rho_k^\\eta$ are approximated to order $\\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a modified energy \\[ J^{\\eta}(\\rho) = J(\\rho) - \\frac{\\eta}{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{\\delta J}{\\delta \\rho} (\\rho) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,\\rho(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\\eta$ a deceleration in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\\eta$ we study JKO-Flow, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\\eta$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.",

A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations.",

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain -- even well-calibrated models provide no mechanism to identify \\textit{which specific predictions} are unreliable. We develop a geometric framework addressing both calibration and instance-level uncertainty quantification for neural network probability outputs. Treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric, we construct: (i) Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems while extending naturally to multi-class settings, and (ii) geometric reliability scores that translate calibrated probabilities into actionable uncertainty measures, enabling principled deferral of ambiguous predictions to human review. Theoretical contributions include: consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework captures 72.5\\% of errors while deferring 34.5\\% of samples, reducing automated decision error rates from 16.8\\% to 6.9\\%. Notably, calibration alone yields marginal accuracy gains; the operational benefit arises primarily from the reliability scoring mechanism, which applies to any well-calibrated probability output.

This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd.

In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation.

We tested whether the dogs implemented hierarchical or synergistic usage of cues while finding food. We found limited prioritization of olfactory cues over visual cues in dichromatic choice tests but in phases with similar perceptual elements, the sensory choice was not clear. Furthermore, free-ranging dogs display a dynamic decision-making in unpredictable urban environments adopting a good-enough strategy during foraging. They prefer speed over accuracy, settling for intermediate quality food if their preferred food item is not available. These dogs also displayed left-bias during food choice. In multi-sensorial, natural setting multiple modulators like environmental noise, risk, and internal perceptual elements apart from food cues seem to be affecting the decision-making in dogs.",

The analysis of multimodal MRI data provides an effective method for detecting sleep deprivation-induced neural network abnormalities. The structure-function coupling (SC-FC) integrates functional connectivity with white matter structural information, which can enable comprehensive detection of brain network abnormalities and offer quantitative measures of sleep deprivation-induced neural damage. This study integrates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to systematically investigate brain network reorganization and their relationship with emotional functions in partial sleep deprivation (PSD). Our methodology employed DTI to construct structural connectivity (SC) networks and rs-fMRI to establish functional connectivity (FC) networks, then construct SC-FC coupling model . The experiment included 16 healthy controls (HC) and 20 PSD patients, with comprehensive whole-brain and nodal-level SC-FC analyses performed. The results show that (1) severe FC disruptions in PSD patients involving the limbic system, default mode network, sensorimotor network, and visual networks; (2) altered SC in default mode, sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory networks; (3) significant SC-FC decoupling in these networks; and (4) strong correlations between these neural changes and clinical measures (KSQ and HADS scores). The SC-FC coupling approach achieved comprehensive detection of PSD-related network abnormalities. Compared to single-modal approaches, this integrated SC-FC analysis provides more comprehensive biomarkers for sleep-related emotional dysregulation. This innovative multimodal neuroimaging approach elucidates the neural mechanisms of SC-FC imbalance induced by PSD, establishing novel biomarkers for sleep-mediated emotional dysregulation.",

Many theoretical frameworks continue to analyse these elements in isolation, making it difficult to explain sudden changes reported by individuals,such as abrupt spikes in anxiety, sudden drops in dissociation, or even moments of heightened alertness. The mathematical modelling employed herein does not replace clinical or subjective narratives, but rather provides a structural framework for these rapid transitions and elucidates why bodily-driven and cognitively-driven changes manifest differently.

    "abstract": "Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.",

This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits.

    "title": "HyperADRs: A Hierarchical Hypergraph Framework for Drug-Gene-ADR Prediction",
    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major barrier to safe and effective pharmacotherapy and increasingly reflect higher order interactions between drugs, genetic background, and clinical phenotypes. Existing graph based approaches usually predict ADRs as properties of drugs or drug pairs, leaving the causal gene implicit and limiting their value for pharmacogenomic decision making. We introduce HyperADRs, a hierarchical hypergraph framework that predicts ADR risk at the level of drug-gene-ADR triads. Starting from curated pharmacogenomic annotations in PharmGKB and the pharmacogenomics subdatabase of DrugBank, we construct high confidence triplets and integrate them with auxiliary molecular, functional, and disease relations from precision-medicine-oriented knowledge graphs. Drugs, genes, and ADR concepts are embedded with modality appropriate pretrained models (UniMol, ESM2, SapBERT) and propagated through a hypergraph convolutional network. A FiLM based, query conditioned contrastive learning module learns context specific representations so that, given any two entities, the model retrieves the correct third entity against many candidates. To improve robustness and interpretability, we propose a nine category ADR macro system scheme that reduces large heterogeneous \"other\" bins while aligning with organ system reasoning in clinical pharmacology. Across drug-, gene-, and ADR-held-out evaluations on PharmGKB, HyperADRs matches or exceeds strong baselines on ranking based metrics. When trained on PharmGKB and tested on unseen DrugBank triplets, HyperADRs maintains its ranking advantage, indicating that the learned representations capture transferable biological mechanisms and can support mechanistically grounded pharmacogenomic hypothesis generation.",

    "abstract": "Computation fundamentally separates time from space: nondeterministic search is exponential in time but polynomially simulable in space (Savitch's Theorem). We propose that the brain physically instantiates a biological variant of this theorem through Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI), creating a geometry of certainty from the chaos of exploration. We formalize the cortical algorithm as a recursive topological transformation of flow into scaffold:$H_{odd}^{(k)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Condense}} H_{even}^{(k+1)}$, where a stable, high-frequency cycle ($\\beta_1$) at level $k$ is collapsed into a static atomic unit ($\\beta_0$) at level $k+1$. Through this Topological Trinity (Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Condensation), the system amortizes the thermodynamic cost of inference. By reducing complex homological loops into zero-dimensional defects (memory granules), the cortex converts high-entropy parallel search into low-entropy serial navigation. This mechanism builds a ``Tower of Scaffolds'' that achieves structural parity with the environment, allowing linear cortical growth to yield exponential representational reach. However, this efficiency imposes a strict limit: the same metric contraction that enables \\emph{generalization} (valid manifold folding) inevitably risks \\emph{hallucination} (homological collapse). We conclude that intelligence is the art of navigating this trade-off, where the ``Geometry of Certainty'' is defined by the precise threshold between necessary abstraction and topological error.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms are key for structuring ecological communities, but they are sensitive to environmental change and fluctuations in population size. Consequently, how mutualisms achieve stability remains an open question in ecological theory. Motivated by previous results in competitive and predator-prey interactions, we hypothesize that self-organized pattern formation can act as a key stabilizing mechanism of mutualistic interactions. We test this hypothesis using a two-species reaction-diffusion model of a plant-pollinator system that incorporates non-local plant competition and local mutualistic interactions. We first perform a linear stability analysis to determine the conditions under which non-local competition can trigger vegetation pattern formation. We then compute the bifurcation diagrams for both spatial and homogeneous solutions and find that pattern formation enables coexistence at mutualistic strengths below the threshold required in well-mixed populations. This stability gain increases as environmental conditions worsen, because local maxima in vegetation density create the conditions for community persistence despite globally harsh conditions. Moreover, in the strong mutualism limit, the spatial system exhibits multistability between patterned and homogeneous solutions, creating alternative stable configurations that can buffer against fluctuations in population abundance. Spatial self-organization thus stabilizes mutualistic communities through spatial patterns, potentially driving plant-pollinator persistence in stressed environments, including arid ecosystems.",

More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses.

The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction.

    "abstract": "Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete. The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group. When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks. The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.",

We further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of BISM across various experimental settings with different boundary conditions, ranging from confined tissues of arbitrary shape to monolayers composed of different cell types. Importantly, BISM does not require assumptions on cell rheology. Therefore, it can be applied to complex heterogeneous tissues consisting of different cell types, as long as they can be grown on a flat substrate. Finally, we compare BISM to other common stress measurement techniques using a coherent experimental setup, followed by a discussion on its limitations and further perspectives.",

However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.",

    "abstract": "The use of coarse demographic adjustments in clinical equations has been increasingly scrutinized. In particular, adjustments for race have sparked significant debate with several medical professional societies recommending race-neutral equations in recent years. However, current approaches to remove race from clinical equations do not address the underlying causes of observed differences. Here, we present ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a framework to identify explanatory factors of group-level differences, which may inform the development of more accurate and precise clinical equations. We apply ARC to spirometry tests across two observational cohorts, CDC NHANES and UK Biobank, comprising 159,893 participants. Cross-sectional sociodemographic or exposure measures did not explain differences in reference lung function across race groups beyond those already explained by age, sex, and height. By contrast, sitting height accounted for up to 26% of the remaining differences in lung volumes between healthy Black and White adults. We then demonstrate how pulmonary function test (PFT) reference equations can incorporate these factors in a new set of equations called $ARC_{PFT}$, surpassing the predictive performance of the race-neutral GLI-Global equation recommended by major pulmonary societies. When compared to GLI-Global, inclusion of sitting height and waist circumference in $ARC_{PFT}$ decreased mean absolute error by 13% among Black participants in the UK Biobank and by 24% in NHANES. $ARC_{PFT}$ also had reduced vulnerability to domain shift compared to race-based methods, with mean absolute error 19.3% and 35.6% lower than race-stratified models in out-of-sample Asian and Hispanic populations, respectively.

This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.",

Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture. Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event. Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.",

The Human Agent comprises three cooperating agents: Modeler, Controller, and Targeter, each paired with an associated regulatory \"schema\" agent. We also describe fast-Modelers and fast-Controllers; evolutionary shortcuts whose rapid actions will precede awareness. Our core prediction is that the Modeler-schema performs a qualia-based consistency check during saccades and issues a bottom-up target when a discrepancy is found. To test this prediction, we propose a saccadic change-detection experiment that distinguishes Modeler-generated from Modeler-schema-generated targets. Locating qualia in the Modeler-schema ties experience to the regulation and refinement of internal representations, clarifies how awareness arises from model control, and suggests a path toward empirical falsification, thereby offering a concrete, testable proposal toward solving the Hard Problem of consciousness.",

This stems from their ability in enabling continuous, real-time health monitoring. To enable molecular-level analysis, biofluids rich in molecular analytes have become one of the most important target samples for wearable sensors. Among them, sweat stands out as an ideal candidate for next-generation wearable health monitoring platforms due to its completely noninvasive nature and ease of acquisition. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated feasible prototype designs for sweat-based wearable sensors. However, one of the major gaps toward large-scale commercialization is the development of clinically validated standards for sweat analysis. One key requirement is to establish the relationship between sweat analytes and those of blood, the latter serving as the gold standard in modern diagnostics. This review provides an overview of sweat biomarkers, with a particular focus on their partitioning mechanisms, which reveal the underlying connections between sweat analytes and their counterparts within systemic metabolic pathways. In addition, this review offers a mechanistic-level examination of biosensors employed in sweat sensing, addressing a gap that has not been adequately covered in prior reviews. Given the critical role of electronic systems in constructing highly integrated wearable sweat-monitoring platforms, this review also analyzes the electronic architectures used for sensor signal processing from an interdisciplinary perspective, with particular emphasis on the analog circuitry that interfaces with electrochemical sensors.",

    "abstract": "High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Clinical dialogue represents a complex duality requiring both the empathetic fluency of natural conversation and the rigorous precision of evidence-based medicine. While Large Language Models possess unprecedented linguistic capabilities, their architectural reliance on reactive and stateless processing often favors probabilistic plausibility over factual veracity. This structural limitation has catalyzed a paradigm shift in medical AI from generative text prediction to agentic autonomy, where the model functions as a central reasoning engine capable of deliberate planning and persistent memory. Moving beyond existing reviews that primarily catalog downstream applications, this survey provides a first-principles analysis of the cognitive architecture underpinning this shift. We introduce a novel taxonomy structured along the orthogonal axes of knowledge source and agency objective to delineate the provenance of clinical knowledge against the system's operational scope. This framework facilitates a systematic analysis of the intrinsic trade-offs between creativity and reliability by categorizing methods into four archetypes: \\textit{Latent Space Clinicians}, \\textit{Emergent Planners}, \\textit{Grounded Synthesizers}, and \\textit{Verifiable Workflow Automators}. For each paradigm, we deconstruct the technical realization across the entire cognitive pipeline, encompassing strategic planning, memory management, action execution, collaboration, and evolution to reveal how distinct architectural choices balance the tension between autonomy and safety.",

    "abstract": "Animals employ strategic decision-making while carefully weighing nutritional benefits against the risks presented by aversive or harmful stimuli in their natural environment, to maximize foraging efficiency, In India, free-ranging dogs subsist predominantly on human-generated waste, where they often encounter food contaminated with unpalatable or noxious substances such as lemon juice while scavenging. The strategies these dogs use to navigate such challenges remain poorly understood, yet are critical for understanding their ecological adaptability and survival in human-dominated environments. A total of 156 randomly encountered free-ranging adult dogs were tested across 15 sites in Nadia district, West Bengal. Each individual was exposed to a single food source containing chicken placed in either lemon juice, diluted lemon solution, or water. All trials were video-recorded, and the behavioural sequences of the dogs, including sniffing, licking, eating, and food manipulation were coded and analysed to quantify strategic foraging responses under unpalatable conditions. They were found to use a flexible, multi-pronged strategy to manipulate the comparatively less palatable food option, and typically avoid the most unpalatable one, to maximize their acquiring options. Overall, this study revealed a hierarchically structured and context-dependent foraging strategy of free-ranging dogs, propelled by sensory evaluation, risk-reward balancing, and behavioural flexibility. These findings demonstrated how urban scavengers dynamically adapt to aversive conditions while scavenging, underscoring the cognitive mechanisms that support their survival in human-dominated environments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a computational framework for generating realistic transition paths between distinct conformations of large bio-molecular systems. The method is built on a stochastic integro-differential formulation derived from the Langevin bridge formalism, which constrains molecular trajectories to reach a prescribed final state within a finite time and yields an efficient low-temperature approximation of the exact bridge equation. To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in cortical areas often integrate signals from different origins. In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas.",

In that way, we create a new dataset designed specifically for training expressive, fully atomistic protein generators. By retraining La-Proteina, which models discrete residue type and side chain structure in a continuous latent space, on this dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art results, with improvements of +54% in structural diversity and +27% in co-designability. To validate the broad utility of our approach, we further introduce Proteina Atomistica, a unified flow-based framework that jointly learns the distribution of protein backbone structure, discrete sequences, and atomistic side chains without latent variables. We again find that training on our new sequence-structure data dramatically boosts benchmark performance, improving \\method's structural diversity by +73% and co-designability by +5%.

Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.",

Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs.

    "abstract": "Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.",

We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\\phi \\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms.

Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool.

Leveraging data from the this http URL database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques.

Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples.

Discretization over p-adic balls yields a high-dimensional nonlinear ODE system, which we solve numerically to examine how environmental and kinetic parameters, particularly CO2 concentration, influence morphogenetic outcomes.

These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.",

    "abstract": "We present a spatially-extended system of chemical reactions exhibiting adaptation to time-dependent influxes of reactants. Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent {\\alpha} < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.",

Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.",

    "abstract": "The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.",

    "abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty. In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.",

    "abstract": "Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals. Code is available at this https URL .",

This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.",

After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds.

    "abstract": "Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.",

We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.",

By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level.

A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.",

Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.",

An improved understanding of apoptosis can significantly enhance our knowledge of biological processes and systems. For instance, pathogens can manipulate the apoptotic process to either evade immune detection or to facilitate their spread. Furthermore, of particular clinical interest is the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, hence allowing them to survive and proliferate uncontrollably. Thus, in this work, we propose a phase-field framework for simulating intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis induced by an activation field, including deriving the configurational mechanics underlying such phenomena. Along with exploring varying conditions needed to initiate or reduce apoptosis, this can serve as a starting point for computational therapeutic testing. To showcase model capabilities, we present simulations exhibiting different types of cellular dynamics produced when varying the mechanisms underlying apoptosis. The model is subsequently applied to probe different morphological transitions, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, cavity formation and fragmentation.

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne arbovirus circulating between mosquitoes of the genus Culex and birds, with a potential spillover to humans and other mammals. Recent trends in climatic change, characterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures, and above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe, including Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of a system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept of diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent parameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality rate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts across space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory birds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has non-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany (2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement with the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed spreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly driven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and vectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for migratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new locations in Germany.",

The method is based on the use of motion sensitizing gradients with changing first moment to encode velocity. As such, it is completely non-invasive and requires no contrast injections. Methods: The technique consists of acquiring a series of images preceded by preparatory RF pulses that encode velocity information, analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity distribution can be decoded via the Fourier transform. We demonstrate its use on a simple flow phantom with known flow characteristics. We demonstrate the technique on the brains of five human participants from whom we collected the velocity distribution along each of the three laboratory axes. Results: Velocity distribution measurements on simple phantoms yielded velocity distributions consistent with theory. Human velocity spectra identified specific anatomical features at different velocity bins. The largest fraction of spins was in the lowest velocity bands. Movement in the CSF spaces could be clearly identified at different velocity bands. Conclusion: Velocity Spectrum Imaging has great potential as a tool to study the movement of fluids in the human body without contrast agents. In addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in vivo, it can be used to study the complex movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders.

    "abstract": "Although the combined treatment of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and emerging target therapy has significantly improved the outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer, distant metastasis remains the leading cause of treatment failure. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based multimodal framework integrating CT imaging, radiomics, and clinical data to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC. A total of 1497 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor and organ masks were generated from pretreatment CT scans, from which a 3D Swin Transformer extracted deep imaging features, while 1562 radiomics features were reduced to 36 via correlation filtering and random forest selection. Clinical data (age, sex, smoking, and alcohol status) were encoded and fused with imaging features, and the multimodal representation was fed into a fully connected network for prediction. Five-fold cross-validation was used to assess performance via AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The multimodal model outperformed all single-modality baselines. The deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of 0.715, whereas multimodal fusion significantly improved performance (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758). Stratified analyses confirmed good generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation experiments demonstrated complementary contributions from each modality, and the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representations than conventional architectures. This multimodal deep learning model enables accurate, non-invasive metastasis prediction in HNSCC and shows strong potential for individualized treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed. Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of genomics data is central to nearly all areas of modern biology. Despite significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational methods, these technologies require significant human oversight to generate novel and reliable biological insights. Consequently, the genomics community has developed a substantial number of diverse visualization approaches and a proliferation of tools that biologists rely on in their data analysis workflows. While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data. Gosling Designer addresses four key challenges observed in existing genomics visualization tools: (1) limited versatility, (2) difficulty of visualization authoring, (3) complexity of data management, and (4) barriers to sharing and collaboration.",

Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Long COVID \"brain fog\" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Drug synergy is strongly influenced by cellular context. Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling. Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.",

Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling trajectory of a pretrained biomolecular structure prediction model using both global and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.

    "abstract": "Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\\mathrm{\\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\\mathrm{\\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.",

This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

    "abstract": "The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL .",

The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure in order to select numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the extent to which groups with elevated mortality rates ex ante might opt out of guaranteed national pensions in favour of demographically aligned plans, which we label equitable longevity risk sharing (ELRiS) pools, even if this involves accepting some idiosyncratic risk. Technically, this paper develops a stochastic model of retirement income within an ELRiS structure that is calibrated to equate the discounted expected utility of a guaranteed national pension. The practical motivation for developing this alternative is that working members of First Nations peoples of Canada: (1) experience much higher mortality rates than average over their entire life cycle, and (2) some are actually allowed by current legislation to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). We then demonstrate that under reasonable economic preferences and parameters, a sub-group with a 10-year life expectancy gap relative to the population could attain equivalent lifetime utility by contributing a mere two-thirds to the plan, even if they were pooled with only 30 members. For a longevity gap of 20 years, such as between an Indigenous male versus a non-Indigenous female, the contribution rate falls to less than a third. The difference between the statutory and mandatory contribution rates to a guaranteed national pension and those needed within these self-sustaining pools is an implicit subsidy from Indigenous to non-Indigenous. From a policy perspective, this paper aspires to jump-start a conversation that sparks a change in a status quo, which is obviously unfair and inequitable.",

In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.",

    "abstract": "Turnpike theorems state that if an investor's utility is asymptotically equivalent to a power utility, then the optimal investment strategy converges to the CRRA strategy as the investment horizon tends to infinity. This paper aims to derive the convergence rates of the turnpike theorem for optimal feedback functions in stochastic factor models. In these models, optimal feedback functions can be decomposed into two terms: myopic portfolios and excess hedging demands. We obtain convergence rates for myopic portfolios in nonlinear stochastic factor models and for excess hedging demands in quadratic term structure models, where the interest rate is a quadratic function of a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We show that the convergence rates are determined by (i) the decay speed of the price of a zero-coupon bond and (ii) how quickly the investor's utility becomes power-like at high levels of wealth. As an application, we consider optimal collective investment problems and show that sharing rules for terminal wealth affect convergence rates.",

    "abstract": "Despite the empirical success in modeling volatility of the rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, it suffers from pricing and calibration difficulties stemming from its non-Markovian structure. To address this, we propose a comprehensive computational framework that enhances both simulation and calibration. First, we develop a modified Sum-of-Exponentials (mSOE) Monte Carlo scheme which hybridizes an exact simulation of the singular kernel near the origin with a multi-factor approximation for the remainder. This method achieves high accuracy, particularly for out-of-the-money options, with an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ computational cost. Second, based on this efficient pricing engine, we then propose a distribution-matching calibration scheme by using Wasserstein distance as the optimization objective. This leverages a minimax formulation against Lipschitz payoffs, which effectively distributes pricing errors and improving robustness. Our numerical results confirm the mSOE scheme's convergence and demonstrate that the calibration algorithm reliably identifies model parameters and generalizes well to path-dependent options, which offers a powerful and generic tool for practical model fitting.",

    "abstract": "Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.",

The results show that countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, and Denmark are in the high energy trilemma group with index scores of 82.2, 82.3, 82.7, and 83.3, respectively. Countries in the high group have achieved a high level of balance between energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Australia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia are in the medium energy trilemma group with index scores of 76.4, 76.6, 77.1, 77.6, and 78.7, respectively. Countries in the medium group have made progress in balancing the dimensions of the energy trilemma but have not yet reached excellence. However, countries such as Mexico, Türkiye, Colombia, and Costa Rica are in the low energy trilemma group with index scores of 63.1, 64.1, 64.8, and 69.3, respectively. These low energy trilemma group countries face significant challenges in balancing energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability and need to make improvements in these areas.",

We provide a complete characterization of all deterministic equilibrium investment strategies. Our results reveal that the solution structure depends critically on the distribution of risk aversion: the equilibrium is unique whenever it exists in the case of finite expected risk aversion, whereas an infinite expectation can lead to infinitely many equilibria or to a unique trivial one (pi equals 0). To address this multiplicity, we introduce three optimality criteria-optimal, uniformly optimal, and uniformly strictly optimal-and explicitly characterize the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding equilibria. Under the same necessary and sufficient condition, the optimal and uniformly optimal equilibria exist uniquely and coincide. Furthermore, by additionally assuming that the market price of risk is non-zero near the terminal time, we show that the optimal (and hence uniformly optimal) equilibrium is also uniformly strictly optimal. Finally, we perform comparative statics to demonstrate that a risk aversion distribution dominating another in the reverse hazard rate order leads to a less aggressive equilibrium strategy.",

Automated smart-contract activity adjusted much later, with structural breaks appearing in January 2025. We validate these shifts using surrogate-based robustness tests. Complementary energy-spectrum analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum identifies pronounced post-election turbulence, and a structural vector autoregression confirms a regime shift in stablecoin dynamics.

Motivated by practices on leading e-commerce platforms, we analyze a sequential duopolistic newsvendor game where retailers first publicly set prices and subsequently make private inventory decisions under demand uncertainty. Our theory predicts that higher profit margins and demand uncertainty intensify price competition, while optimal inventory responses to demand uncertainty are shaped by profit margins. Laboratory evidence, however, reveals that participants are generally reluctant to compete on price, frequently coordinating on salient focal (reserve) prices, particularly in low-margin settings, and show little sensitivity to demand uncertainty in pricing. On the inventory side, participants' order quantities are largely insensitive to chosen prices and continue to exhibit well-documented Pull-to-Center biases. These findings reveal a disconnect between pricing and inventory decisions under competition and highlight the importance of accounting for persistent behavioral tendencies in retail operations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context and qualitative nuances but struggle with the rigorous and transparent reasoning required in high-stakes quantitative domains such as financial trading. We propose a model-first hybrid architecture for the options \"wheel\" strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with the robustness of a Bayesian Network. Rather than using the LLM as a black-box decision-maker, we employ it as an intelligent model builder. For each trade decision, the LLM constructs a context-specific Bayesian network by interpreting current market conditions, including prices, volatility, trends, and news, and hypothesizing relationships among key variables. The LLM also selects relevant historical data from an 18.75-year, 8,919-trade dataset to populate the network's conditional probability tables. This selection focuses on scenarios analogous to the present context. The instantiated Bayesian network then performs transparent probabilistic inference, producing explicit probability distributions and risk metrics to support decision-making. A feedback loop enables the LLM to analyze trade outcomes and iteratively refine subsequent network structures and data selection, learning from both successes and failures. Empirically, our hybrid system demonstrates effective performance on the wheel strategy. Over nearly 19 years of out-of-sample testing, it achieves a 15.3% annualized return with significantly superior risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio 1.08 versus 0.62 for market benchmarks) and dramatically lower drawdown (-8.2% versus -60%) while maintaining a 0% assignment rate through strategic option rolling. Crucially, each trade decision is fully explainable, involving on average 27 recorded decision factors (e.g., volatility level, option premium, risk indicators, market context).",

Using the identification strategy of Ottonello and Song (2022), which isolates high-frequency surprises to banks' credit supply capacity, we show that positive shocks appreciate local currencies, lower external borrowing costs, increase capital flows to domestic banking sectors, and raise investment, credit, and real activity across EMEs. These effects are highly robust across specifications and samples. Using administrative credit-registry data from Uruguay, we find that better capitalized banks transmit global credit easing more strongly. At the firm level, responses are weaker for more leveraged firms, especially those with foreign-currency debt, short maturities, or collateral not priced to market.",

This key finding holds across a comprehensive suite of robustness tests, including alternative measures of bank stability and model specifications. We document significant cross-sectional heterogeneity, with the effect being more pronounced in countries with heavier penalties for illegal cyber activities and legal frameworks that hold banks accountable for their cybersecurity practices. In addition, the positive impact is stronger in jurisdictions with greater international legal cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms. We further investigate two channels (i.e., funding liquidity and operational risk) through which cybercrime laws may influence bank stability. Our results indicate that these laws can significantly bolster bank stability by enhancing funding liquidity and mitigating operational risk. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of cybercrime legislation in fostering a secure and resilient banking environment. It offers new insights into how these laws contribute to bank stability on both individual and systemic levels.",

This sequential structure, often referred to as \"virtual observability,\" suggests that timing alone can shape expectations and choices, even when no information is revealed. The original notion of virtual observability, however, is an equilibrium refinement based on the timing structure and has no bite in games with a unique equilibrium. In this paper, we experimentally examine whether timing still affects behavior in such games, using the Traveler's Dilemma and the Trust Game. We find that in the sequential Traveler's Dilemma without observability, first movers tend to behave closer to the equilibrium prediction than in the simultaneous version. In contrast, timing without observability has no effect on behavior in the Trust Game.",

A sustainable annual GDP growth rate of 7 to 8 percent is projected as necessary to achieve this milestone while maintaining fiscal prudence through a targeted deficit threshold below 3.5 percent of GDP. The study underscores the role of disciplined fiscal management in financing critical public investments in infrastructure, human capital development and technological innovation. Given constraints on domestic resource mobilization, the paper highlights the importance of multilateral financial institutions, including the World Bank, IMF and ADB, in expanding fiscal space in India through concessional financing, technical cooperation, and risk sharing mechanisms. Using econometric modeling and scenario analysis, the research identifies key policy interventions in infrastructure, healthcare, education and sustainable energy that can maximize growth while ensuring fiscal sustainability. Policy recommendations include enhancing tax buoyancy, rationalizing expenditure, optimizing public private partnerships and strengthening fiscal responsibility frameworks. The findings suggest that a calibrated approach to growth, prudent fiscal management and strategic international collaborations are critical to achieving long term economic aspirations of India.",

    "abstract": "This study models the monopoly pricing of weather index insurance as a Bowley-type sequential game involving a profit-maximizing insurer (leader) and a farmer (follower). The farmer chooses an insurance payoff to minimize a convex distortion risk measure, while the insurer anticipates this best response and selects a premium principle and its parameters to maximize profit net of administrative costs. For the insurer, we adopt three different premium-principle parameterizations: (i) an expected premium with a single risk-loading factor, (ii) a two-parameter distortion premium based on a power transform, and (iii) a fully flexible pricing kernel drawn from the general Choquet integral representation with nondecreasing distortions. For the farmer, we model index payoffs using neural networks and compare solutions under fully connected architectures with those under convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We solve the game using a penalized bilevel programming algorithm that employs a function-value-gap penalty and delivers convergence guarantees without requiring the lower-level objective to be strongly convex. Based on Iowa's soybean yields and high-dimensional PRISM weather data, we find that CNN-based designs yield smoother, less noisy payoffs that reduce basis risk and push insurer profits closer to indemnity insurance levels. Moreover, expanding pricing flexibility from a single loading to a two-parameter distortion premium, and ultimately to a flexible pricing kernel, systematically increases equilibrium profits.",

    "abstract": "The empirical literature that covers Phillips Curve analysis during recessionary periods is notably scant. The Great Recession has rekindled a debate on the validity and stability of the Phillips Curve which is still ongoing. The basis for this debate is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without causing a drop in inflation. This paper carries out an empirical analysis for the classical expectation-augmented Phillips curve model across 41 countries from1980-2016 by distinguishing tranquil and recessionary periods separately. Based on the results of the research, the paper finds that dynamics of Phillips Curve changes during recessionary periods and the empirical relationship becomes no longer valid. These findings support the ongoing debate about the missing disinflation and collapse of the Phillips curve, but only during the recessionary periods. In the case of tranquil periods, the empirical relationship still seems to be valid. Moreover, the paper also observes that both backward-looking and forward-looking fractions of inflation gain weight and significance during recessionary periods. However, the paper remains indecisive about which exact fraction gains more weight and significance as the panel model does not incorporate these two fractions of inflation in a single hybrid framework simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "We study the construction of arbitrage-free option price surfaces from noisy bid-ask quotes across strike and maturity. Our starting point is a Chebyshev representation of the call price surface on a warped log-moneyness/maturity rectangle, together with linear sampling and no-arbitrage operators acting on a collocation grid. Static no-arbitrage requirements are enforced as linear inequalities, while the surface is fitted directly to prices via a coverage-seeking quadratic objective that trades off squared band misfit against spectral and transport-inspired regularisation of the Chebyshev coefficients. This yields a strictly convex quadratic program in the modal coefficients, solvable at practical scales with off-the-shelf solvers (OSQP). On top of the global backbone, we introduce a local post-fit layer based on a discrete fog of risk-neutral densities on a three-dimensional lattice (m,t,u) and an associated Hamiltonian-type energy. On each patch of the (m,t) plane, the fog variables are coupled to a nodal price field obtained from the baseline surface, yielding a joint convex optimisation problem that reweights noisy quotes and applies noise-aware local corrections while preserving global static no-arbitrage and locality. The method is designed such that for equity options panels, the combined procedure achieves high inside-spread coverage in stable regimes (in calm years, 98-99% of quotes are priced inside the bid-ask intervals) and low rates of static no-arbitrage violations (below 1%). In stressed periods, the fog layer provides a mechanism for controlled leakage outside the band: when local quotes are mutually inconsistent or unusually noisy, the optimiser allocates fog mass outside the bid-ask tube and justifies small out-of-band deviations of the post-fit surface, while preserving a globally arbitrage-free and well-regularised description of the option surface.",

To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications. Qwen3-8B provides a very promising base for advancing dynamic quantitative trading systems in the future.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating rare-event forecasts is challenging because standard metrics collapse as event prevalence declines. Measures such as F1-score, AUPRC, MCC, and accuracy induce degenerate thresholds -- converging to zero or one -- and their values become dominated by class imbalance rather than tail discrimination. We develop a family of rare-event-stable (RES) metrics whose optimal thresholds remain strictly interior as the event probability approaches zero, ensuring coherent decision rules under extreme rarity. Simulations spanning event probabilities from 0.01 down to one in a million show that RES metrics maintain stable thresholds, consistent model rankings, and near-complete prevalence invariance, whereas traditional metrics exhibit statistically significant threshold drift and structural collapse. A credit-default application confirms these results: RES metrics yield interpretable probability-of-default cutoffs (4-9%) and remain robust under subsampling, while classical metrics fail operationally. The RES framework provides a principled, prevalence-invariant basis for evaluating extreme-risk forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \\$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \\emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \\emph{solvency}, \\emph{revenue}, and \\emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \\emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \\$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by approximately $8\\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \\$630 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency.",

    "abstract": "Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators. The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33. Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.",

Our aim is to tap the benefits of frequent trading over short horizons while acknowledging that drift is hard to pin down, whereas volatility can be screened using realized or implied measures for appropriately selected assets. Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \\cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional. Synthetic and real-data studies demonstrate reduced pessimism relative to DRC and improved performance over myopic DRO-Markowitz under frequent rebalancing.",

Recent contributions have established existence and uniqueness for the optimal martingale under finite second moment assumptions on the marginals, but numerical methods exist only in the one-dimensional setting. We introduce an iterative scheme, a martingale analogue of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm, and prove its convergence in arbitrary dimension under minimal assumptions. In particular, we show that convergence holds when the marginals have finite moments of order $p > 1$, thereby extending the known theory beyond the finite-second-moment regime. The proof relies on a strict descent property for the dual value of the martingale Benamou--Brenier problem. While the descent property admits a direct verification in the case of compactly supported marginals, obtaining uniform control on the iterates without assuming compact support is substantially more delicate and constitutes the main technical challenge.",

We consider both profit shifting and real responses of multinational enterprises, and highlight the role of the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE) in investment incentives and tax rate setting. The GMT reduces the true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the revenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run where tax rates are fixed, the GMT reduces the small country's revenue if profit shifting costs are low and increases it otherwise. In the long run where countries adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition pattern. We reveal that the minimum rate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate, countries will set tax rates below the minimum to boost capital investments and collect top-up taxes. Simulations show that a moderate GMT rate can raise both countries' revenues and the large country's welfare in the long run. However, it may reduce the small country's welfare if the welfare weight of private income is high.",

In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.",

As rare events are typically highly correlated, it is important to study heavy-tailed multivariate distributions of the relevant variables, especially in the presence of non-stationarity. We use a generalized scalar product between correlation matrices to clearly demonstrate this non-stationarity. Further, we present a model that we recently put forward, which captures how the non-stationary fluctuations of correlations make the tails of multivariate distributions heavier. Here, we provide the resulting formulae including Gaussian or Algebraic features. Compared to our previous results, we manage to remove in the Algebraic cases one out of the two, respectively three, fit parameters which considerably facilitates applications. We demonstrate the usefulness of these results by deriving joint distributions for linear combinations of amplitudes and validating them with financial data. Furthermore, we explicitly work out the moments of our model distributions. In a forthcoming paper we apply the model to financial markets.",

In a Solow-Zeira task-automation economy with a CES aggregator $\\sigma < 1$, we introduce an AI capability parameter that scales the productivity of automatable tasks and obtain a tractable expression for the AI capability threshold -- the minimum productivity of AI relative to pre-AI automation required for a balanced transfer. Using current U.S. economic parameters, we find that even in the conservative scenario where no new tasks or jobs emerge, AI systems would only need to reach only 5-7 times today's automation productivity to fund an 11%-of-GDP UBI. Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automation productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it. These results therefore offer a rigorous benchmark for assessing when advancing AI capabilities might sustainably finance social transfers in an increasingly automated economy.",

The proposed AMS framework reformulates the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events and is applied under both Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics. Numerical experiments cover European, Asian, and up-and-in barrier digital options, together with a multidimensional digital payoff designed as a stress test. Across all contracts, AMS achieves substantial gains, reaching up to 200-fold improvements over standard Monte Carlo, while preserving unbiasedness and showing robust performance with respect to the choice of importance function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of AMS to derivative pricing.

Results indicate that female faculty earn approximately 6% less than comparable male colleagues, with variation in the gap across career stages and levels of research productivity. This case study demonstrates how causal inference methods for observational data can provide insight into structural disparities in complex social systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper revisits the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium framework through the lens of effective trade, emphasizing the distinction between theoretical and realizable market interactions. We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM), where transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate supply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main properties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash equilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis extends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds and exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is shaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized negotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby call into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled via the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information limitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus offers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical general equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal consistency within a unified framework.",

We demonstrate how to generate synthetic missing values while ensuring that synthetic data mimic the targeted real data distribution. We propose and empirically compare several data generation frameworks utilizing various strategies for handling missing data (complete case, inverse probability weighting, and multiple imputation) by quantifying generation performance through a range of metrics.

As $N$ grows, its samples become nearly independent, but with an increased computational cost. We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour. We also present new theoretical results regarding the i-SIR, such as the convexity of asymptotic variance in the number of proposals, which can be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Adaptively collected data has become ubiquitous within modern practice. However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets. Numerical simulations corroborate our findings.",

However, most existing function-on-function regression methodologies assume independence between observations, which is often unrealistic for spatially structured functional data. We propose a novel penalized spatial function-on-function regression model to address this limitation. Our approach extends the generalized spatial two-stage least-squares estimator to functional data, while incorporating a roughness penalty on the regression coefficient function using a tensor product of B-splines. This penalization ensures optimal smoothness, mitigating overfitting, and improving interpretability. The proposed penalized spatial two-stage least-squares estimator effectively accounts for spatial dependencies, significantly improving estimation accuracy and predictive performance. We establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator, proving its $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing non-penalized estimators, particularly under moderate to strong spatial dependence. In addition, an application to North Dakota weather data illustrates the practical utility of our approach in modeling spatially correlated meteorological variables. Our findings highlight the critical role of penalization in enhancing robustness and efficiency in spatial function-on-function regression models.

    "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.",

    "abstract": "Angular data are commonly encountered in settings with a directional or orientational component. Regressing an angular response on real-valued features requires intrinsically capturing the circular or spherical manifold the data lie on, or using an appropriate extrinsic transformation. A popular example of the latter is the technique of distributional wrapping, in which functions are \"wrapped\" around the unit circle via a modulo-$2{\\pi}$ transformation. This approach enables flexible, non-linear models like Gaussian processes (GPs) to properly account for circular structure. While straightforward in concept, the need to infer the latent unwrapped distribution along with its wrapping behavior makes inference difficult in noisy response settings, as misspecification of one can severely hinder estimation of the other. However, applications such as radiowave analysis (Shangguan et al., 2015) and biomedical engineering (Kurz and Hanebeck, 2015) encounter radial data where wrapping occurs in only one direction. We therefore propose a novel wrapped GP (WGP) model formulation that recognizes monotonic wrapping behavior for more accurate inference in these situations. This is achieved by estimating the locations where wrapping occurs and partitioning the input space accordingly. We also specify a more robust Student's t response likelihood, and take advantage of an elliptical slice sampling (ESS) algorithm for rejection-free sampling from the latent GP space. We showcase our model's preferable performance on simulated examples compared to existing WGP methodologies. We then apply our method to the problem of localizing radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags, in which we model the relationship between frequency and phase angle to infer how far away an RFID tag is from an antenna.",

    "abstract": "Treatment effects under stochastic policy shifts quantify differences in outcomes across counterfactual scenarios with varying treatment distributions. Stochastic policy shifts generalize common notions of treatment effects since they include deterministic interventions (e.g., all individuals treated versus none treated) as a special case. While stochastic policy effects have been examined under causal exchangeability, they have not been integrated into the difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, which relies on parallel trends rather than exchangeability. In this paper, nonparametric efficient estimators of stochastic intervention effects are developed under a DiD setup with continuous treatments. The proposed causal estimand is the average stochastic dose effect among the treated, where the stochastic dose effect is the contrast between potential outcomes under a counterfactual dose distribution and no treatment. Several possible stochastic interventions are discussed, including those that do and do not depend on the observed data distribution. For generic stochastic interventions, the causal estimand is identified under standard conditions and estimators are proposed. Then, we focus on a specific stochastic policy shift, the exponential tilt, that increments the conditional density function of the continuous dose. For the exponential tilt intervention, a nonparametric estimator is proposed that allows for data-adaptive, machine learning nuisance function estimation. Under mild convergence rate conditions, the estimator is shown to be root-$n$ consistent and asymptotically normal with variance attaining the nonparametric efficiency bound. The proposed method is used to study the effect of hydraulic fracturing activity on employment and income.",

Using phase-level data from the 2018/19 Premiership Rugby season (35,199 phases across 132 matches) and an angle-distance model of penalty kick success estimated from international records, we construct two surfaces: (i) the expected points of a possession beginning with a lineout, and (ii) the expected points of a kick at goal, taking into account the in-game consequences of made and missed kicks. We then compare these surfaces to produce decision maps that indicate where kicking for goal or kicking to touch maximizes expected return, and we analyze how the boundary shifts with game context and the expected meters gained to touch. Our results provide a unified, data-driven method for evaluating penalty decisions and can be tailored to team-specific kickers and lineout units. This study offers, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive EP-based assessment of penalty strategy in rugby union and outlines extensions to win-probability analysis and richer tracking data.",

Understanding uncertainty can help quantify and mitigate these issues and provide a fuller picture. However, this task is especially challenging because the rank parameters are discrete and the central limit theorem does not apply to the rank estimates. In this article, we propose a Repro Samples Method to address this nontrivial inference problem by developing a confidence set for the true, unobserved population ranks.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing such methods through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) constructed on tree ensembles -- more precisely, on the random partitions generated by randomized regression trees. We establish fundamental analytical properties of the resulting Random Forest kernel, including boundedness, continuity, and universality, and show that a Random Forest predictor can be characterized as the unique minimizer of a penalized empirical risk functional in this RKHS, providing a variational interpretation of ensemble learning. We further extend this perspective to the continuous-time formulation of Gradient Boosting introduced by Dombry and Duchamps, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a gradient flow on a Hilbert manifold induced by the Random Forest RKHS. A key feature of this framework is that both the kernel and the RKHS geometry are data-dependent, offering a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of tree-based ensembles. Finally, we illustrate the practical potential of this approach by introducing a kernel principal component analysis built on the Random Forest kernel, which enhances the interpretability of ensemble models, as well as GVI, a new geometric variable importance criterion.",

However, even when a surrogate is strongly correlated with the outcome or satisfies conventional surrogate validity conditions, surrogate-based ITRs may diverge from outcome-optimal decisions - particularly under realistic budget constraints. To address this gap, we develop a framework for evaluating the decision-making value of surrogate endpoints. We introduce three ITR-oriented performance metrics: surrogate regret, which measures the utility loss from using surrogate-based ITRs instead of outcome-optimal ITRs; surrogate gain, which quantifies the benefit of surrogate-based treatment decisions relative to no treatment; and surrogate efficiency, which evaluates improvement over random treatment assignment. We further extend these metrics to budget-constrained settings and propose doubly robust estimators. We establish their asymptotic properties and provide valid statistical inference. Simulation and real data studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Overall, this work offers the first principled framework to rigorously evaluate surrogates, providing a promising pathway toward more efficient decision-making.",

A practical estimation procedure is proposed, with a hyperparameter selection scheme that identifies a parsimonious set of action orders and interim ranks, thereby revealing the possibly latent hierarchical structures. Theoretically, non-asymptotic error bounds are derived for the proposed estimators in both regression and autoregressive settings.

    "abstract": "Sequential optimization of black-box functions from noisy evaluations has been widely studied, with Gaussian Process bandit algorithms such as GP-UCB guaranteeing no-regret in stationary settings. However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed. In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \\textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.",

    "title": "Exploring Student Interactions with AI-Powered Learning Tools: A Qualitative Study Connecting Interaction Patterns to Educational Learning Theories",
    "abstract": "With the growing use of artificial intelligence in classrooms and online learning, it has become important to understand how students actually interact with AI tools and how such interactions match with traditional ways of learning. In this study, we focused on how students engage with tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Khan Academy, and tried to connect their usage patterns with well known learning theories. A small experiment was carried out where undergraduate students completed different learning tasks using these tools, and later shared their thoughts through semi structured interviews. We looked at four types of interaction directive, assistive, dialogic, and empathetic and compared them with learning approaches like behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and humanism. After analyzing the interviews, we found five main themes Feedback and Reinforcement, Cognitive Scaffolding, Dialogic Engagement, Personalization and Empathy, and Learning Agency. Our findings show that how useful an AI tool feels is not just about its features, but also about how students personally connect with it. By relating these experiences to existing educational theories, we have tried to build a framework that can help design better AI based learning environments. This work aims to support teachers, EdTech designers, and education researchers by giving practical suggestions grounded in real student experiences.",

We introduce a statistical framework for formally testing the similarity of competing risks models based on transition probabilities, which represent the cumulative risk of each event over time. Our method defines a maximum-type distance between the transition probability matrices of two multistate processes and employs a novel constrained parametric bootstrap test to evaluate similarity under both administrative and random right censoring. We theoretically establish the asymptotic validity and consistency of the bootstrap test. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our method reliably controls the type I error and achieves higher statistical power than existing intensity-based approaches. Applying the framework to routine clinical data of prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy, we identify the smallest similarity threshold at which patients with and without prior in-house fusion biopsy exhibit comparable readmission dynamics. The proposed method provides a robust and interpretable tool for quantifying similarity in event history models.",

We prove that when the correlation $\\rho$ is less than $1$, up to logarithmic terms, low degree non-trivial estimation fails. Our results suggest that the task of aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as hard as the problem of aligning two graphs in polynomial time, up to logarithmic factors.

This paper introduces a Bayesian state-space modeling framework for estimating the latent degradation dynamics of Formula 1 tires using publicly available timing data from the FastF1 Python API. Lap times are modeled as a function of fuel mass and latent tire pace, with pit stops represented as state resets. Several model extensions are explored, including compound-specific degradation rates, time-varying degradation dynamics, and a skewed t observation model to account for asymmetric driver errors. Using Lewis Hamilton's performance in the 2025 Austrian Grand Prix as a case study, the proposed framework demonstrates superior predictive performance over an ARIMA(2,1,2) baseline, particularly under the skewed t specification. Although compound-specific degradation differences were not statistically distinct, the results show that the state-space approach provides interpretable, probabilistic, and computationally efficient estimates of tire degradation. This framework can be generalized to multi-race or multi-driver analyses, offering a foundation for real-time strategy modeling and performance prediction in Formula 1 racing.",

We formulate this problem as the minimization of a conditional KL divergence. Compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation, our algorithm is prior-free and likelihood-free, meaning that we do not need to impose any prior on the original signals or any observational model, which often restricts the model's flexibility. To tackle the KL divergence minimization problem, we propose a sequential algorithm that reduces the KL divergence and learns an optimal de-mixing flow model at each iteration. This approach completely avoids the unstable adversarial training, a common issue in minimizing the KL divergence. Experiments on toy and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method.",

The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting. We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\\otimes n}, Q_n^{\\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \\log(dQ_{\\infty} / dP_{\\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.",

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often prohibitive for large datasets, and existing variational Bayes methods rely on conjugacy or strong approximations that limit their applicability and can underestimate posterior variances. We propose a scalable variational framework that incorporates semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) with basis representations of spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs), which may not have conjugacy. Our approach accommodates gamma, negative binomial, Poisson, Bernoulli, and Gaussian responses on continuous spatial domains. Across 20 simulation scenarios with 50,000 locations, SIVI achieves predictive accuracy and posterior distributions comparable to Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo while providing notable computational speedups. Applications to MODIS land surface temperature and Blue Jay abundance further demonstrate the utility of the approach for large non-Gaussian spatial datasets.",

Simulations spanning event probabilities from 0.01 down to one in a million show that RES metrics maintain stable thresholds, consistent model rankings, and near-complete prevalence invariance, whereas traditional metrics exhibit statistically significant threshold drift and structural collapse. A credit-default application confirms these results: RES metrics yield interpretable probability-of-default cutoffs (4-9%) and remain robust under subsampling, while classical metrics fail operationally.

To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware. Our method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that incorporates information from the outcome.

The effectiveness of this estimator and its sensitivity to several settings are demonstrated through a simulation study.

    "abstract": "We consider a statistical model of a n-mode quantum Gaussian state which is shift invariant and also gauge invariant. Such models can be considered analogs of classical Gaussian stationary time series, parametrized by their spectral density. Defining an appropriate quantum spectral density as the parameter, we establish that the quantum Gaussian time series model is asymptotically equivalent to a classical nonlinear regression model given as a collection of independent geometric random variables. The asymptotic equivalence is established in the sense of the quantum Le Cam distance between statistical models (experiments). The geometric regression model has a further classical approximation as a certain Gaussian white noise model with a transformed quantum spectral density as signal. In this sense, the result is a quantum analog of the asymptotic equivalence of classical spectral density estimation and Gaussian white noise, which is known for Gaussian stationary time series. In a forthcoming version of this preprint, we will also identify a quantum analog of the periodogram and provide optimal parametric and nonparametric estimates of the quantum spectral density.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials assessing neurological treatment are challenging due to the diversity of brain function, and the difficulty in quantifying it. Traditional treatment studies in epilepsy use seizure frequency as the primary outcome measure, which may overlooking meaningful improvements in patients' quality of life. This paper introduces the Clinical Instrument for Measuring Patient Anecdotes in Clinical Trials (Clinical IMPACT), a novel tool designed to capture qualitative non-seizure improvement across neurological domains. The Clinical IMPACT incorporates open-ended inquiries that allow participants or caregivers to identify and select anecdotal evidence of their most significant treatment benefits. A blinded panel of experts ranks these anecdotes, facilitating a rigorous statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to detect treatment efficacy. The approach is resistant to type 1 error, yet comprehensive in its ability to capture real-world effects on quality of life. The potential of the Clinical IMPACT tool to enhance sensitivity while also providing qualitative insights that can inform patients, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies about treatment effects makes it important to consider in any neurological trial. We describe how it can be used in epilepsy, and advocate for its inclusion as a key secondary endpoint to provide a perspective on non-seizure outcomes, which have previously been challenging to measure, let alone to interpret, even when the clinical trial is positive.",

Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.",

From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates. To support this framework, we develop a spline-based estimator for univariate log-density ratios that is flexible, robust, and computationally efficient.

Weighting methods such as inverse probability of sampling weights (IPSW) reweight study participants to resemble a target population, but the accuracy of these estimates depends heavily on how well the chosen population represents the population of substantive interest. We conduct a simulation study grounded in empirical covariate distributions from several real-world data sources spanning a continuum from highly selective to broadly inclusive populations. Using treatment effect scenarios with varying levels of effect modification, we evaluate IPSW estimators of the population average treatment effect (PATE) across multiple candidate target populations. We quantify the bias that arises when the dataset used to operationalize the target population differs from the intended inference population, even when IPSW is correctly specified. Our results show that bias increases systematically as target populations diverge from a well-representative population, and that weighting to a poorly aligned target can introduce more bias than not weighting at all. These findings highlight that selecting an appropriate target population dataset is a critical design choice for valid generalization.",

They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.",

We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems.

The model is called ``sparse'' because the functional coefficients are only nonzero in the local time region where the functional covariates have significant effects on the response under different quantile levels. To tackle the computational and theoretical challenges in optimizing the quantile loss function added with a concave penalty, we develop a novel Convolution-smoothing based Locally Sparse Estimation (CLoSE) method, to do three tasks in one step, including selecting significant functional covariates, identifying the nonzero region of functional coefficients to enhance the interpretability of the model and estimating the functional coefficients. We establish the functional oracle properties and simultaneous confidence bands for the estimated functional coefficients, along with the asymptotic normality for the estimated parameters. In addition, because it is difficult to estimate the conditional density function given the scalar and functional covariates, we propose the split wild bootstrap method to construct the confidence interval of the estimated parameters and simultaneous confidence band for the functional coefficients. We also establish the consistency of the split wild bootstrap method. The finite sample performance of the proposed CLoSE method is assessed with simulation studies. The proposed model and estimation procedure are also illustrated by identifying the active time regions when the daily temperature influences the soybean yield.",

Classical functional results, including law of large numbers and mixing properties, are extended to this diffusion-driven setting. Building on these results, we study parametric inference for the Hawkes component: we derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator in the long-time regime, and derive stronger convergence results under additional assumptions on the covariate process. We further propose hypothesis testing procedures to assess the statistical relevance of the covariate.

To focus on the most informative representations, projections are ranked according to clustering quality criteria, and only a selected subset is retained. In particular, we adopt Gaussian Mixture Models as base clusterers and employ the Kullback-Leibler divergence to order the random projections; these choices enable fast computation and eliminate the need to specify the number of clusters a priori.

These effects are often characterized by non-linear exposure-lag-response relationships and delayed impacts over time. Accurately capturing these dynamics is crucial for informing public health interventions. The Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) is a flexible statistical framework for estimating such effects in epidemiological research. However, standard DLNM implementations typically assume a homogeneous exposure-lag-response association across the study region, overlooking potential spatial heterogeneity, which can lead to biased risk estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce DLNM-Clust: a novel mixture of DLNMs that extends the traditional DLNM. Within a Bayesian framework, DLNM-Clust probabilistically assigns each geographic unit to one of $C$ latent spatial clusters, each of which is defined by a distinct DLNM specification. This approach allows capturing both common patterns and singular deviations in the exposure-lag-response surface. We demonstrate the method using municipality-level time-series data on the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of COVID-19 in Belgium.

    "abstract": "Understanding the temporal dynamics of functional brain connectivity is important for addressing various questions in network neuroscience, such as how connectivity affects cognition and changes with disease. A fundamental challenge is to evaluate whether connectivity truly exhibits dynamics, or simply is static. The most common frequentist approach uses sliding-window methods to model functional connectivity over time, but this requires defining appropriate sampling distributions and hyperparameters, such as window length, which imposes specific assumptions on the dynamics. Here, we explore how these assumptions influence the detection of dynamic connectivity, and introduce an alternative approach based on Bayesian hypothesis testing with Wishart processes. This framework encodes assumptions through prior distributions, allowing prior knowledge on the time-dependent structure of connectivity to be incorporated into the model. Moreover, this framework provides evidence for both dynamic and static connectivity, offering additional information. Using simulations, we compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches and demonstrate how different assumptions affect the detection of dynamic connectivity. Finally, by applying both approaches to an fMRI working-memory task, we find that conclusions at the individual level vary with modeling choices, while group-level results are more robust. Our work highlights the importance of carefully considering modeling assumptions when evaluating dynamic connectivity.",

    "title": "Improved Disease Outbreak Detection from Out-of-sequence measurements Using Markov-switching Fixed-lag Particle Filters",
    "abstract": "Particle filters (PFs) have become an essential tool for disease surveillance, as they can estimate hidden epidemic states in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. In epidemic modelling, population dynamics may be governed by distinct regimes such as endemic or outbreak phases which can be represented using Markov-switching state-space models. In many real-world surveillance systems, data often arrives with delays or in the wrong temporal order, producing out-of-sequence (OOS) measurements that pertain to past time points rather than the current one. While existing PF methods can incorporate OOS measurements through particle reweighting, these approaches are limited in their ability to fully adjust past latent trajectories. To address this, we introduce a Markov-switching fixed-lag particle filter (FL-PF) that resimulates particle trajectories within a user-specified lag window, allowing OOS measurements to retroactively update both state and model estimates. By explicitly reevaluating historical samples, the FL-PF improves the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and reduces false alarms. We also show how to compute the log-likelihood within the FL-PF framework, enabling parameter estimation using Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$). Together, these contributions extend the applicability of PFs to surveillance systems where retrospective data are common, offering a more robust framework for monitoring disease outbreaks and parameter inference.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference is optimal when the statistical model is well-specified, while outside this setting Bayesian inference can catastrophically fail; accordingly a wealth of post-Bayesian methodologies have been proposed. Predictively oriented (PrO) approaches lift the statistical model $P_\\theta$ to an (infinite) mixture model $\\int P_\\theta \\; \\mathrm{d}Q(\\theta)$ and fit this predictive distribution via minimising an entropy-regularised objective functional. In the well-specified setting one expects the mixing distribution $Q$ to concentrate around the true data-generating parameter in the large data limit, while such singular concentration will typically not be observed if the model is misspecified. Our contribution is to demonstrate that one can empirically detect model misspecification by comparing the standard Bayesian posterior to the PrO `posterior' $Q$. To operationalise this, we present an efficient numerical algorithm based on variational gradient descent. A simulation study, and a more detailed case study involving a Bayesian inverse problem in seismology, confirm that model misspecification can be automatically detected using this framework.",

Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \\emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \\emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \\emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns. These results illustrate the methodological and practical advantages of joint modeling over separate network analyses in the study of bipartite systems.",

When these integrals lack closed-form expressions, numerical methods must be used, from the Newton-Cotes formulas and Gaussian quadrature, to Monte Carlo and variational approximation techniques. Despite these numerous tools, few are guaranteed to preserve majoration/minoration inequalities, while this feature is fundamental in certain applications in statistics. In this paper, we focus on the integration problem arising in the estimation of moments of scalar, unnormalized, distributions. We introduce a sequential method for constructing upper and lower bounds on the sought integral. Our approach leverages the majorization-minimization framework to iteratively refine these bounds, in an enveloped principle. The method has proven convergence, and controlled accuracy, under mild conditions.

We propose to make use of a new hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm that includes two weighted components in the Hessian matrix estimation: the first one coming from the natural Hessian estimate and the second associated with the stochastic gradient information. Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk.",

However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.",

The inference of such structures can be performed in a Bayesian framework, and involves the use of sampling algorithms such as Gibbs samplers aimed at deriving posterior distribution of the probabilities of observations to belong to specific clusters. Unfortunately, traditional implementations of Gibbs samplers in this context often face critical challenges, such as inefficient use of computational resources and unnecessary updates for observations that are highly likely to remain in their current cluster. This paper introduces a new adaptive Gibbs sampler that improves the convergence efficiency over existing methods. In particular, our sampler is guided by a function that, at each iteration, uses the past of the chain to focus the updating on observations potentially misclassified in the current clustering, i.e.\\ those with a low probability of belonging to their current component. Through simulation studies and two real data analyses, we empirically demonstrate that, in terms of convergence time, our method tends to perform more efficiently compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

Evaluating the fit of these computer models involves tuning their parameters to observational data from IBEX. This would be a classic (Bayesian) inverse problem if not for three challenges: (1) the computer simulations are slow, limiting the size of campaigns of runs; so (2) surrogate modeling is essential, but outputs are high-resolution images, thwarting conventional methods; and (3) IBEX observations are counts, whereas most inverse problem techniques assume Gaussian field data. To fill that gap we propose a novel approach to Bayesian inverse problems coupling a Poisson response with a sparse Gaussian process surrogate using the Vecchia approximation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed framework, which compare favorably to alternatives, through multiple simulated examples in terms of recovering \"true\" computer model parameters and accurate out-of-sample prediction.

    "abstract": "The beginning of the rainy season and the occurrence of dry spells in West Africa is notoriously difficult to predict, however these are the key indicators farmers use to decide when to plant crops, having a major influence on their overall yield. While many studies have shown correlations between global sea surface temperatures and characteristics of the West African monsoon season, there are few that effectively implementing this information into machine learning (ML) prediction models. In this study we investigated the best ways to define our target variables, onset and dry spell, and produced methods to predict them for upcoming seasons using sea surface temperature teleconnections. Defining our target variables required the use of a combination of two well known definitions of onset. We then applied custom statistical techniques -- like total variation regularization and predictor selection -- to the two models we constructed, the first being a linear model and the other an adaptive-threshold logistic regression model. We found mixed results for onset prediction, with spatial verification showing signs of significant skill, while temporal verification showed little to none. For dry spell though, we found significant accuracy through the analysis of multiple binary classification metrics. These models overcome some limitations that current approaches have, such as being computationally intensive and needing bias correction. We also introduce this study as a framework to use ML methods for targeted prediction of certain weather phenomenon using climatologically relevant variables. As we apply ML techniques to more problems, we see clear benefits for fields like meteorology and lay out a few new directions for further research.",

After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations.

    "abstract": "Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often struggle to recognize when an input lies outside their training experience, leading to unreliable and overconfident predictions. Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \\textit{uncertainty} and detect \\textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) for physiological time series depends on the ability of a pretraining objective to preserve information about the underlying physiological state while filtering out unrelated noise. However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "Sheaf Neural Networks equip graph structures with a cellular sheaf: a geometric structure which assigns local vector spaces (stalks) and a linear learnable restriction/transport maps to nodes and edges, yielding an edge-aware inductive bias that handles heterophily and limits oversmoothing. However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.",

We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification.

In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\\phi \\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.",

Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \\emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\\{A, B\\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\\min\\{A, B\\}\\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.",

An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, RTZ-VI-LCB is the first to attain this optimality, sets a new benchmark for offline RTZMGs, and is validated experimentally.",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) is making decisions based on incomplete and noisy observations, especially in perturbed and partially observable Markov decision processes (P$^2$OMDPs). Existing methods fail to mitigate perturbations while addressing partial observability. We propose \\textit{Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CaDiff)}, a framework that enhances any RL algorithm by uncovering the underlying causal structure of P$^2$OMDPs. This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model. Experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CaDiff enhances returns by at least 14.18\\% compared to baselines. CaDiff is the first framework that approximates causal states using diffusion models with both theoretical rigor and practicality.",

While such games often involve non-convex non-concave objectives, empirical evidence shows that simple gradient methods frequently converge, suggesting a hidden geometric structure. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory.",

Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used to nowcast quarterly GDP growth, but adoption in high-stakes settings requires that predictive accuracy be matched by interpretability and robust uncertainty quantification. This article reviews recent developments in macroeconomic nowcasting and compares econometric benchmarks with ML approaches in data-rich and shock-prone environments, emphasizing the use of nowcasts as decision inputs rather than as mere error-minimization exercises. The discussion is organized along three axes. First, we contrast penalized regressions, dimension-reduction techniques, tree ensembles, and neural networks with autoregressive models, Dynamic Factor Models, and Random Walks, emphasizing how each family handles small samples, collinearity, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts. Second, we examine explainability tools (intrinsic measures and model-agnostic XAI methods), focusing on temporal stability, sign coherence, and their ability to sustain credible economic narratives and nowcast revisions. Third, we analyze non-parametric uncertainty quantification via block bootstrapping for predictive intervals and confidence bands on feature importance under serial dependence and ragged edge. We translate these elements into a reference workflow for \"decision-grade\" nowcasting systems, including vintage management, time-aware validation, and automated reliability audits, and we outline a research agenda on regime-dependent model comparison, bootstrap design for latent components, and temporal stability of explanations.

In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE.",

In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $\\Omega(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis. Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data.

However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines. Additionally, our approach learns effective seeding policies that generalize across problem instances without retraining, such as varying the network size or the number of seed nodes.",

    "title": "List Replicable Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Replicability is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as RL algorithms are empirically observed to be unstable and sensitive to variations in training conditions. To formally address this issue, we study \\emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \\emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \\emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \\emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice. In particular, we show that empirically, our new planning strategy can be incorporated into practical RL frameworks to enhance their stability.",

    "abstract": "Nonparametric regression estimators, including those employed in regression-discontinuity designs (RDD), are central to the economist's toolbox. Their application, however, is complicated by the presence of asymptotic bias, which undermines coverage accuracy of conventional confidence intervals. Extant solutions to the problem include debiasing methods, such as the widely applied robust bias-corrected (RBC) confidence interval of Calonico et al. (2014, 2018). We show that this interval is equivalent to a prepivoted interval based on an invalid residual-based bootstrap method. Specifically, prepivoting performs an implicit bias correction while adjusting the nonparametric regression estimator's standard error to account for the additional uncertainty introduced by debiasing. This idea can also be applied to other bootstrap schemes, leading to new implicit bias corrections and corresponding standard error adjustments. We propose a prepivoted interval based on a bootstrap that generates observations from nonparametric regression estimates at each regressor value and show how it can be implemented as an RBC-type interval without the need for resampling. Importantly, we show that the new interval is shorter than the existing RBC interval. For example, with the Epanechnikov kernel, the length is reduced by 17%, while maintaining accurate coverage probability. This result holds irrespectively of: (a) the evaluation point being in the interior or on the boundary; (b) the use of a 'small' or 'large' bandwidths; (c) the distribution of the regressor and the error term.",

Similar to the continuous case, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function, whose monotonicity plays a central role in deriving the error bounds of the generated data. Notably, the complexity of our model scales linearly up to logarithmic factors, rather than exponentially, with the dimension, making it efficiently scalable to high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees that do not rely on the boundedness of the estimated score-covering not only uniform noising processes on $\\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ and on $\\mathbb{N}^d$, but also masking-based noising dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Classical statistical inference and learning theory often fail to explain the success of modern neural networks. A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $\\lambda_{\\alpha}$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders). Our experiments recover known scaling laws while others yield meaningful deviations from theoretical expectations. Overall, our paper illustrates the many merits of SLT for understanding neural network phase transitions, and poses open research questions for the field.",

While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \\textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.",

These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.",

Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of $p_1\\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition may exist for rank-$r$ $\\Sigma$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1<r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r>p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability. Differential geometric quantities, such as the differential of the diffeomorphism, as well as the Riemannian gradient and Hessian operator on $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ and the manifolds used in constructing $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, are also derived.

    "abstract": "Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.",

This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model. We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.",

In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.",

Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \\cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional.

This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for constructing multi-view diffusion geometries through intertwined multi-view diffusion trajectories (MDTs), a class of inhomogeneous diffusion processes that iteratively combine the random walk operators of multiple data views. Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.",

In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $\\alpha$ and the variable selection ratio $\\rho$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = \\alpha N$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = \\rho N$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\\rho N$ dimensions can separate $\\alpha N$ random patterns if and only if $\\alpha < 2\\rho$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification.

    "abstract": "Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees.",

By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO.

One challenge of such analyses is that the rate-of-change is only available indirectly when change patterns are nonlinear with respect to time. Latent change score models (LCSMs), which can be employed to investigate the change in rate-of-change at the individual level, have been developed to address this challenge. We extend an existing LCSM with the Jenss-Bayley growth curve \\cite[Chapter~18]{Grimm2016growth} and propose a novel expression for change scores that allows for (1) unequally-spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement occasions around each wave. We also extend the existing model to estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration (that largely determines the trajectory shape and is viewed as the most important parameter in the Jenss-Bayley model). We present the proposed model by a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation study demonstrates that the proposed model can estimate the parameters unbiasedly and precisely and exhibit target confidence interval coverage. The simulation study also shows that the proposed model with the novel expression for the change scores outperforms the existing model. An empirical example using longitudinal reading scores shows that the model can estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration and generate individual rate-of-change in practice.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal processes are often associated with each other over time; therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental processes and understand their joint development. The latent growth curve model (LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the TVC's effect on a longitudinal outcome while simultaneously modeling the outcome's change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC's effect into initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized as (1) interval-specific slopes, (2) interval-specific changes, or (3) changes from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses, assuming a linear-linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear functions.",

    "abstract": "Growth mixture modeling (GMM) is an analytical tool for identifying multiple unobserved sub-populations of longitudinal processes. In particular, it describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and examines between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group. One research interest in utilizing GMMs is to explore how covariates affect such heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu and Perera (2022c) extended mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which mainly focus on time-invariant covariates, for allowing the covariates to account for within-group and between-group differences simultaneously and examining the heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu and Perera (2022c) and examines the effects on trajectory heterogeneity of time-varying covariates (TVCs). Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into a trait feature (e.g., the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of state features (e.g., interval-specific slopes or changes). The trait features are allowed to account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e., trait effect), and the state features are allowed to impact observed values of a longitudinal process (i.e., state effect). We examine the proposed models using a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. The simulation study demonstrated that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories into several clusters and generally generating unbiased and accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities. With the proposed models, we showed the heterogeneity in the trait and state features of reading ability across latent classes of students' mathematics performance. Meanwhile, the trait and state effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous across the clusters of students.",

In basketball, a player or team has a hot hand when their performance during a match is better than expected or they are on a streak of making consecutive shots. This phenomenon has generated a great deal of controversy with detractors claiming its non-existence while other authors indicate its evidence. In this work, we present a Bayesian longitudinal hidden Markov model that analyses the hot hand phenomenon in consecutive basketball shots, each of which can be either missed or made. Two possible states (cold or hot) are assumed in the hidden Markov chains of events, and the probability of success for each throw is modelled by considering both the corresponding hidden state and the distance to the basket. This model is applied to a real data set, the Miami Heat team in the season 2005-2006 of the USA National Basketball Association. We show that this model is a powerful tool for assessing the overall performance of a team during a match or a season, and, in particular, for quantifying the magnitude of the team streaks in probabilistic terms.",

To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.",

While this model framework has been proposed before, we here further relax its distributional assumption by using a quasi-likelihood setup. By parameterizing the mean-variance relationship on data entries, we additionally introduce a dispersion parameter and entry-wise weights to model large variations and missing values. The resulting model is thus not only robust to distribution misspecification but also more flexible and able to capture mean-dependent covariance structures of the data matrix. Our main focus is on efficient computational approaches to perform the factor analysis. Previous modeling frameworks rely on simulated maximum likelihood (SML) to find the factorization solution, but this method was shown to lead to asymptotic bias when the simulated sample size grows slower than the square root of the sample size $n$, eliminating its practical application for data matrices with large $n$. Borrowing from expectation-maximization (EM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we investigate three estimation procedures based on iterative factorization updates. Our proposed solution does not show asymptotic biases, and scales even better for large matrix factorizations with error $O(1/p)$.

Factor analytic decompositions express the covariance as a sum of a low rank and diagonal matrix.

In this article, we exploit a blessing of dimensionality to develop a provably accurate posterior approximation for the covariance matrix that bypasses the need for Gibbs or other variants of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Our proposed Factor Analysis with BLEssing of dimensionality (FABLE) approach relies on a first-stage singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the latent factors, and then defines a jointly conjugate prior for the loadings and residual variances. The accuracy of the resulting posterior approximation for the covariance improves with increasing samples as well as increasing dimensionality. We show that FABLE has excellent performance in high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation, including producing well-calibrated credible intervals, both theoretically and through simulation experiments.

To address this issue, we develop a new algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of negative binomial parameters, which is more efficient and more accurate than existing methods. We further extend negative binomial distributions with a new parameterization to cover Poisson distributions as a special class. We provide theoretical justifications showing that, when applied to a Poisson data, the estimated parameters of the extended negative binomial distribution can consistently recover the true Poisson distribution.",

By assuming the edges of networks at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in a straightforward manner. Due to the possibly large number of parameters in the models, the natural MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration employing projection, which mitigates the impact of the other parameters (Chang et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2023). Leveraging a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the assumption of stationarity. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, although it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions. Illustration with a transitivity model was carried out in both simulation and a real network data set.",

    "abstract": "The estimand framework proposed by ICH in 2017 has brought fundamental changes in the pharmaceutical industry. It clearly describes how a treatment effect in a clinical question should be precisely defined and estimated, through attributes including treatments, endpoints and intercurrent events. However, ideas around the estimand framework are commonly in text, and different interpretations on this framework may exist. This article aims to interpret the estimand framework through its underlying theories, the causal inference framework based on potential outcomes. The statistical origin and formula of an estimand is given through the causal inference framework, with all attributes translated into statistical terms. We describe how five strategies proposed by ICH to analyze intercurrent events are incorporated in the statistical formula of an estimand, and we also suggest a new strategy to analyze intercurrent events. The roles of target populations and analysis sets in the estimand framework are compared and discussed based on the statistical formula of an estimand. This article recommends continuing studying causal inference theories behind the estimand framework and improving the estimand framework with greater methodological comprehensibility and availability.",

    "abstract": "Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust against partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, when the model is misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, such as careless respondents. To this end, the estimator minimizes a robust loss function based on the divergence between observed frequencies and theoretical frequencies implied by the polychoric model. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation, is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed, and comes at no additional computational cost. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.",

This paper presents an alternative approach to DTF that focusses on how the distribution of the latent trait differs over groups, which is referred to as impact. We propose to compare two estimates of impact, one that naively aggregates over all test items and one that down-weights items that exhibit differential item functioning (DIF). Taking this approach, we make the following three contributions to the literature on DTF. First it is shown that the difference between the two estimates provides a convenient effect size for quantifying the extent to which DIF affects conclusions about impact (as opposed to test scores). Second, we provide a relatively general purpose Wald test of the difference between two estimates of impact. Third, we extend the recent literature on robust scaling to propose a procedure for down-weighting items that is shown to produce consistent estimates of impact whenever fewer than 1/2 of items exhibit DIF. Using simulations and an empirical example from physics education, we show how the proposed effect size and test statistic perform using the proposed robust estimator of impact, as well as estimators that arise from conventional item-by-item tests of DIF.",

For instance, methods such as the LASSO and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) formulate model selection as finding a sparse solution to a linear system of equations determined by training data. However, absent strong assumptions, such methods are highly unstable: if a single data point is removed from the training set, a different model may be selected. In this paper, we present a new approach to stabilizing model selection with theoretical stability guarantees that leverages a combination of bagging and an ''inflated'' argmax operation. Our method selects a small collection of models that all fit the data, and it is stable in that, with high probability, the removal of any training point will result in a collection of selected models that overlaps with the original collection. We illustrate this method in (a) a simulation in which strongly correlated covariates make standard LASSO model selection highly unstable, (b) a Lotka-Volterra model selection problem focused on identifying how competition in an ecosystem influences species' abundances, (c) a graph subset selection problem using cell-signaling data from proteomics, and (d) unsupervised $\\kappa$-means clustering.

To address these challenges, we introduce Localized Conformal Multi-Quantile Regression (LCMQR), a novel framework that synergizes multi-quantile information with kernel-based localization to construct efficient and adaptive prediction intervals. Theoretically, we resolve an inconsistency in Conformalized Composite Quantile Regression (CCQR) by proving that our consistent Average-then-Max scoring mechanism systematically yields tighter intervals than the Max-then-Average approach used in prior work. For heterogeneous environments, we extend this framework to Group-Calibrated LCMQR (GC-LCMQR) via a stratified calibration step that guarantees finite-sample validity within distinct subgroups. Experiments on benchmark datasets and an Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) task demonstrate that LCMQR achieves superior efficiency on standard benchmarks, while GC-LCMQR uniquely achieves group-level coverage for target subgroups in mixture populations where baselines fail.",

    "abstract": "Causal inference is vital for informed decision-making across fields such as biomedical research and social sciences. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for internal validity of inferences, whereas observational studies (OSs) often provide the opportunity for greater external validity. However, both data sources have inherent limitations preventing their use for broadly valid statistical inferences: RCTs may lack generalizability due to their selective eligibility criterion, and OSs are vulnerable to unobserved confounding. This paper proposes an innovative approach to integrate RCT and OS that borrows the other study's strengths to remedy each study's limitations. The method uses a novel triplet matching algorithm to align RCT and OS samples and a new two-parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify internal and external validity biases. This combined approach yields causal estimates that are more robust to hidden biases than OSs alone and provides reliable inferences about the treatment effect in the general population. We apply this method to investigate the effects of lactation on maternal health using a small RCT and a long-term observational health records dataset from the California National Primate Research Center. This application demonstrates the practical utility of our approach in generating scientifically sound and actionable causal estimates.",

Most homogeneous TL methods assume that target and source domains share the same feature space, which limits their practical applicability. In applications, the target and source features are frequently different due to the inability to measure certain variables in data-poor target environments. Conversely, existing HTL methods do not provide statistical error guarantees, limiting their utility for scientific discovery. Our method first learns a feature map between the missing and observed features, leveraging the vast source data, and then imputes the missing features in the target. Using the combined matched and imputed features, we then perform a two-step transfer learning for penalized regression. We develop upper bounds on estimation and prediction errors, assuming that the source and target parameters differ sparsely but without assuming sparsity in the target model. We obtain results for both when the feature map is linear and when it is nonparametrically specified as unknown functions. Our results elucidate how estimation and prediction errors of HTL depend on the model's complexity, sample size, the quality and differences in feature maps, and differences in the models across domains.",

Also, this procedure maintains asymptotic normality aligning with an OLS estimator given true support, hence holding the oracle properties. Conversely, we prove that no method can achieve exact support recovery if these signal conditions are violated. This fills a critical gap in the minimax optimality theory on support recovery of the double sparse model. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.",

In a multi-agent setup with heterogeneous loss functions, this oversight may lead to unfair outcomes, hence resulting in conflicts during the reconciliation process. To address this, we propose a value-oriented forecast reconciliation approach that focuses on the forecast value for all individual agents. Fairness is ensured through the use of a Nash bargaining framework. Specifically, we model this problem as a cooperative bargaining game, where each agent aims to optimize their own gain while contributing to the overall reconciliation process. We then present a primal-dual algorithm for parameter estimation based on empirical risk minimization. From an application perspective, we consider an aggregated wind energy trading problem, where profits are distributed using a weighted allocation rule. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several numerical experiments, showing that it consistently results in increased profits for all agents involved.",

The key design choice is the number of simulated responses: too many produce overly narrow sets with poor coverage, while too few yield excessively loose estimates. We propose a data-driven approach that adaptively selects the simulation sample size to achieve nominal average-case coverage, regardless of the LLM's simulation fidelity or the confidence set construction procedure. The selected sample size is further shown to reflect the effective human population size that the LLM can represent, providing a quantitative measure of its simulation fidelity.

The hierarchical prior structure captures the extent to which the data supports the simplex constraint, allowing for more efficient and data-adaptive counterfactual estimation. The intractable marginal likelihood induced by the soft simplex constraint presents a major computational challenge, which we resolve by developing a novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that updates the regression coefficients of two predictors simultaneously. Our main theoretical contribution is a high-dimensional selection consistency result for the spike-and-slab variable selection under the simplex constraint, which significantly extends the current theory for high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method performs well across diverse settings.

In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models (SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally, we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success? A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding generalization gap, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding generalization gap behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization gap applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the Rényi entropy of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization gap can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's Rényi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding to the Rényi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.",

We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\\Delta$ of the loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses, we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\\Delta$ by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known $S$ and $\\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.",

The first family consists of symmetric distributions derived from the projection of multivariate normal distributions under specific parameter constraints. This family is closed under marginalization and hence any marginal distribution belongs to a lower-dimensional case of the same family. In particular the univariate marginal of the family is the unimodal case of the projected normal distribution on the circle. The second family is a flexible extension of the copula case of the first family, which can accommodate any univariate marginal distributions. Unlike existing models derived via projection, both families have the common advantage that their parameters possess a clear and intuitive interpretation. The use of latent variables simplifies Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.

    "abstract": "Several natural phenomena exhibit long-range conditional dependencies. High-order mixture transition distribution (MTD) are parsimonious non-parametric models to study these phenomena. An MTD is a Markov chain in which the transition probabilities are expressed as a convex combination of lower-order conditional distributions. Despite their generality, inference for MTD models has traditionally been limited by the need to estimate high-dimensional joint distributions. In particular, for a sample of size n, the feasible order d of the MTD is typically restricted to d approximately O(log n). To overcome this limitation, Ost and Takahashi (2023) recently introduced a computationally efficient non-parametric inference method that identifies the relevant lags in high-order MTD models, even when d is approximately O(n), provided that the set of relevant lags is sparse. In this article, we introduce hdMTD, an R package allowing us to estimate parameters of such high-dimensional Markovian models. Given a sample from an MTD chain, hdMTD can retrieve the relevant past set using the BIC algorithm or the forward stepwise and cut algorithm described in Ost and Takahashi (2023). The package also computes the maximum likelihood estimate for transition probabilities and estimates high-order MTD parameters through the expectation-maximization algorithm. Additionally, hdMTD also allows for simulating an MTD chain from its stationary invariant distribution using the perfect (exact) sampling algorithm, enabling Monte Carlo simulation of the model. We illustrate the package's capabilities through simulated data and a real-world application involving temperature records from Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advances have made it easier to collect large and complex networks of time-stamped relational events connecting two or more entities. Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of these events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on past history and external information. However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches still rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the effects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying and non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take this further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor product smooths. We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In particular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and impact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic factors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential non-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). This expression uncovers a fundamental property of the loss landscape of depth-2 matrix factorization problems: a minimum is flat if and only if it is spectral-norm balanced, which implies that flat minima are not necessarily Frobenius-norm balanced. Furthermore, to complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.",

    "title": "Robust Estimation for Dependent Binary Network Data",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the interaction strength between the nodes of a network based on dependent binary observations residing on these nodes, generated from a Markov Random Field (MRF). Since these observations can possibly be corrupted/noisy in larger networks in practice, it is important to robustly estimate the parameters of the underlying true MRF to account for such inherent contamination in observed data. However, it is well-known that classical likelihood and pseudolikelihood based approaches are highly sensitive to even a small amount of data contamination. So, in this paper, we propose a density power divergence (DPD) based robust generalization of the computationally efficient maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimator of the interaction strength parameter, and derive its rate of consistency under the pure model. Along the way, we establish consistency and asymptotics for a class of general $Z$-estimators, covering our proposed DPD based estimators, under flexible assumptions that hold for a substantial class of standard models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first central limit theorems for the class of general $Z$-estimators in such settings. Moreover, we show that the gross error sensitivities of the proposed DPD based estimators are significantly smaller than that of the MPL estimator, thereby theoretically justifying the greater (local) robustness of the former under contaminated settings. Finally, we demonstrate the superior (finite sample) performance of the DPD based variants over the traditional MPL estimator in a number of synthetically generated contaminated network datasets, and apply them to learn the network interaction strength in several real datasets from diverse domains of social science, neurobiology and genomics.",

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.",

    "abstract": "Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\\eta>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\\rho_k^\\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\\eta$. We show that $\\rho_k^\\eta$ are approximated to order $\\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a modified energy \\[ J^{\\eta}(\\rho) = J(\\rho) - \\frac{\\eta}{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{\\delta J}{\\delta \\rho} (\\rho) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,\\rho(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\\eta$ a deceleration in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\\eta$ we study JKO-Flow, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\\eta$, in several simple numerical examples.

    "abstract": "Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.",

Theoretical contributions include: consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2).

    "abstract": "Wave impact loads on a maritime structure can cause casualties, damage, pollution of the sea and operational delays. Their extreme (or design) values should therefore be considered in the design of these structures. However, this is challenging because these events are both rare and complex, requiring high-fidelity computation and long analysis durations to obtain such design loads. Existing extreme value prediction methods are not tailored or validated for wave impacts. We therefore introduce the new Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS) method for predicting extreme non-linear loads on maritime structures. The method introduces a probabilistic approach to multi-fidelity screening, allowing efficient linear potential flow indicators to be used in the low-fidelity stage, even for strongly non-linear load cases. The method is validated against a range of cases, including non-linear waves, ship vertical bending moments, green water impact loads, and slamming loads. It can be concluded that PAS accurately estimates both the short-term distributions and extreme values in these test cases, with most probable maximum (MPM) values within 10% of the available full brute-force Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) results. In addition, PAS achieves this performance very efficiently, requiring less than 4% of the high-fidelity simulation time needed for conventional MCS. These results demonstrate that PAS can reliably reproduce the statistics of both weakly and strongly non-linear extreme load problems, while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. The present study validates the statistical PAS framework; further work should focus on validating the full procedure including CFD load simulations, and on validating it for long-term extremes.",

This involves solving a sparsity and orthogonality constrained convex maximization problem, which is extremely computationally challenging. Most existing works address sparse PCA via methods-such as iteratively computing one sparse PC and deflating the covariance matrix-that do not guarantee the orthogonality, let alone the optimality, of the resulting solution when we seek multiple mutually orthogonal PCs. We challenge this status by reformulating the orthogonality conditions as rank constraints and optimizing over the sparsity and rank constraints simultaneously. We design tight semidefinite relaxations to supply high-quality upper bounds, which we strengthen via additional second-order cone inequalities when each PC's individual sparsity is specified. Further, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the maximum amount of variance explained as a function of the support. We exploit these relaxations and bounds to propose exact methods and rounding mechanisms that, together, obtain solutions with a bound gap on the order of 0%-15% for real-world datasets with p = 100s or 1000s of features and r \\in {2, 3} components. Numerically, our algorithms match (and sometimes surpass) the best performing methods in terms of fraction of variance explained and systematically return PCs that are sparse and orthogonal. In contrast, we find that existing methods like deflation return solutions that violate the orthogonality constraints, even when the data is generated according to sparse orthogonal PCs.

Although AI can improve cancer detection, most systems rely on complex or specialized medical data, making them impractical for large-scale screening. We introduce Can-SAVE, a lightweight AI system that ranks population-wide cancer risks solely based on medical history events. By integrating survival model outputs into a gradient-boosting framework, our approach detects subtle, long-term patient risk patterns - often well before clinical symptoms manifest. Can-SAVE was rigorously evaluated on a real-world dataset of 2.5 million adults spanning five Russian regions, marking the study as one of the largest and most comprehensive deployments of AI-driven cancer risk assessment. In a retrospective oncologist-supervised study over 1.9M patients, Can-SAVE achieves a 4-10x higher detection rate at identical screening volumes and an Average Precision (AP) of 0.228 vs. 0.193 for the best baseline (LoRA-tuned Qwen3-Embeddings via DeepSeek-R1 summarization). In a year-long prospective pilot (426K patients), our method almost doubled the cancer detection rate (+91%) and increased population coverage by 36% over the national screening protocol. The system demonstrates practical scalability: a city-wide population of 1 million patients can be processed in under three hours using standard hardware, enabling seamless clinical integration. This work proves that Can-SAVE achieves nationally significant cancer detection improvements while adhering to real-world public healthcare constraints, offering immediate clinical utility and a replicable framework for population-wide screening.

    "abstract": "The ProxSkip algorithm for distributed optimization is gaining increasing attention due to its effectiveness in reducing communication. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and fail to achieve linear speedup with respect to the number of nodes. Key questions regarding its behavior in the non-convex setting and the achievability of linear speedup remain open. In this paper, we revisit ProxSkip and address both questions. We provide a comprehensive analysis for stochastic non-convex, convex, and strongly convex problems, revealing the effects of gradient noise, local updates, network connectivity, and data heterogeneity on its convergence. We prove that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup across all three settings, and can further achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we show that properly increasing local updates effectively reduces communication complexity.",

    "abstract": "Real-world time series data often exhibits substantial missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to addressing this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which poses a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges under a high missing rate and are, moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method that estimates uncertainty with ensembles of quantile-regression-based task networks and incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate and reliable imputations, but also remains computationally efficient due to its non-generative framework. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, and the results demonstrates superior performance in both deterministic and probabilistic imputation compared to baselines across most experimental settings.

We identify conditions under which we can (1) subsample the massive clustering instance, (2) evaluate a set of candidate algorithms on the smaller instance, and (3) guarantee that the algorithm with the best accuracy on the small instance will have the best accuracy on the original big instance. We provide theoretical size generalization guarantees for three classic clustering algorithms: single-linkage, k-means++, and (a smoothed variant of) Gonzalez's k-centers heuristic. We validate our theoretical analysis with empirical results, observing that on real-world clustering instances, we can use a subsample of as little as 5% of the data to identify which algorithm is best on the full dataset.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the Hénon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.",

However, to increase its predictive power beyond its linear log-risk, it was extended to utilize deep neural networks, sacrificing its explainability. In this work, we explore the potential of self-explaining neural networks (SENN) for survival analysis. We propose a new locally explainable Cox proportional hazards model, named CoxSE, by estimating a locally-linear log-hazard function using the SENN. We also propose a modification to the Neural additive (NAM) model, hybrid with SENN, named CoxSENAM, which enables the control of the stability and consistency of the generated explanations. Several experiments using synthetic and real datasets are presented, benchmarking CoxSE and CoxSENAM against a NAM-based model, a DeepSurv model explained with SHAP, and a linear CPH model. The results show that, unlike the NAM-based model, the SENN-based model can provide more stable and consistent explanations while maintaining the predictive power of the black-box model. The results also show that, due to their structural design, NAM-based models demonstrate better robustness to non-informative features. Among the models, the hybrid model exhibits the best robustness.",

Traditional feature selection often prioritizes outcome correlation, neglecting the crucial role of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) across arms in CMAB decision-making. This paper introduces two novel, model-free filter methods, Heterogeneous Incremental Effect (HIE) and Heterogeneous Distribution Divergence (HDD), specifically designed to identify features driving HTE. HIE quantifies a feature's value based on its ability to induce changes in the optimal arm, while HDD measures its impact on reward distribution divergence across arms. These methods are computationally efficient, robust to model mis-specification, and adaptable to various feature types, making them suitable for rapid screening in dynamic environments where retraining complex models is infeasible. We validate HIE and HDD on synthetic data with known ground truth and in a large-scale commercial recommender system, demonstrating their consistent ability to identify influential HTE features and thereby enhance CMAB performance.",

This paper proposes a Dual-Prototype Network with Task-wise Adaptation (DPTA) for PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate confusable classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that DPTA consistently surpasses recent methods by 1\\% - 5\\%.

We assessed the AI chatbot's performance in terms of coding accuracy, response quality, and respondent experience. Our findings reveal that AI chatbots perform moderately well in live coding even without survey-specific fine-tuning, despite slightly inflated false positive errors due to respondent acquiescence bias. Open-ended responses were more detailed and informative, but this came at a slight cost to respondent experience. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using AI methods such as chatbots enhanced by LLMs to enhance open-ended data collection in web surveys.",

We consider posterior sampling according to an approximate prior $\\mathcal{P}$, and establish sufficient conditions for stable and accurate recovery with high probability. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound that shows that the sample complexity depends on (i) the intrinsic complexity of $\\mathcal{P}$, quantified by its so-called approximate covering number, and (ii) concentration bounds for the forward operator and noise distributions. As a key application, we specialize to generative priors, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a latent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample complexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing the efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on deterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random sampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is determined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of $\\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in Bayesian recovery as well. Overall, our framework unifies and extends prior work, providing rigorous guarantees for the sample complexity of solving Bayesian inverse problems with arbitrary distributions.",

    "abstract": "In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation",

In this work, we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.",

    "abstract": "The success of federated learning (FL) ultimately depends on how strategic participants behave under partial observability, yet most formulations still treat FL as a static optimization problem. We instead view FL deployments as governed strategic systems and develop an analytical framework that separates welfare-improving behavior from metric gaming. Within this framework, we introduce indices that quantify manipulability, the price of gaming, and the price of cooperation, and we use them to study how rules, information disclosure, evaluation metrics, and aggregator-switching policies reshape incentives and cooperation patterns. We derive threshold conditions for deterring harmful gaming while preserving benign cooperation, and for triggering auto-switch rules when early-warning indicators become critical. Building on these results, we construct a design toolkit including a governance checklist and a simple audit-budget allocation algorithm with a provable performance guarantee. Simulations across diverse stylized environments and a federated learning case study consistently match the qualitative and quantitative patterns predicted by our framework. Taken together, our results provide design principles and operational guidelines for reducing metric gaming while sustaining stable, high-welfare cooperation in FL platforms.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ORACLE, a framework that explains neural networks on tabular and scientific design data. It fits ANOVA-style main and pairwise interaction effects to a model's prediction surface. ORACLE treats a trained network as a black-box response, learns an orthogonal factorial surrogate on a discretized input grid, and uses simple centering and $\\mu$-rebalancing steps to obtain main- and interaction-effect tables that remain $L^2$-consistent with the original model. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly connected to classical design-of-experiments analyses. On synthetic factorial and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression benchmarks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth ANOVA interactions and hotspot structure than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability metrics. In latent image and text settings, ORACLE instead delineates its natural scope, and our results indicate that grid-based ANOVA surrogates are most effective when features admit interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering tabular workflows that require stable, DoE-style interaction summaries.",

    "abstract": "Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed the accuracy of larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across four domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, operations research, and LLM reasoning, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.",

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\\Sigma V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models, we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more balanced learning of the data's underlying components.",

    "abstract": "Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamNX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to momentum SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamNX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

    "abstract": "We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To benchmark open-source or commercial medical image-specific VLMs against real-world radiologist-written reports. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who presented to the emergency department between January 2022 and April 2025 and underwent same-day CXR and CT for febrile or respiratory symptoms. Reports from five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, and MedVersa) and radiologist-written reports were randomly presented and blindly evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination, and language clarity. Comparative performance was assessed using generalized linear mixed models, with radiologist-written reports treated as the reference. Finding-level analyses were also performed with CT as the reference. Results: A total of 478 patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 50-78]; 282 men [59.0%]) were included. AIRead demonstrated the lowest RADPEER 3b rate (5.3% [76/1434] vs. radiologists 13.9% [200/1434]; P<.001), whereas other VLMs showed higher disagreement rates (16.8-43.0%; P<.05). Clinical acceptability was the highest with AIRead (84.5% [1212/1434] vs. radiologists 74.3% [1065/1434]; P<.001), while other VLMs performed worse (41.1-71.4%; P<.05). Hallucinations were rare with AIRead, comparable to radiologists (0.3% [4/1425]) vs. 0.1% [1/1425]; P=.21), but frequent with other models (5.4-17.4%; P<.05). Language clarity was higher with AIRead (82.9% [1189/1434]), Lingshu (88.0% [1262/1434]), and MedVersa (88.4% [1268/1434]) compared with radiologists (78.1% [1120/1434]; P<.05). Sensitivity varied substantially across VLMs for the common findings: AIRead, 15.5-86.7%; Lingshu, 2.4-86.7%; MAIRA-2, 6.0-72.0%; MedGemma, 4.8-76.7%; and MedVersa, 20.2-69.3%.

However, such proximity-based selection ignores the control objective: different reference trajectories may benefit from different data even at the same operating point. In this paper, we propose a datamodel-based approach that learns a context-dependent influence function mapping the current initial trajectory and reference trajectory to column importance scores. Adapting the linear datamodel framework from machine learning, we model closed-loop cost as a linear function of column inclusion indicators, with coefficients that depend on the control context. Training on closed-loop simulations, our method captures which data columns actually improve tracking performance for specific control tasks.

    "abstract": "As 6G networks demand massive connectivity and stronger interference control, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is attractive because it superposes a common stream and user-private streams and remains effective under imperfect CSIT and heterogeneous traffic. In practical multiuser deployments, two considerations arise: the common stream decoding constraint imposed by the weakest user, and residual inter-user interference can remain non-negligible, particularly in single-input single-output (SISO) broadcast settings and under an imperfect CSIT scenario. Motivated by prior advances of RSMA research, we investigate a complementary mechanism-fluid antenna systems (FAS), with dynamic port reconfiguration supplies adaptive spatial selectivity without altering the RSMA signaling structure. Can FAS help alleviate these considerations and enhance RSMA performance? We develop a tractable correlation-aware analytical framework based on block-correlation models, including constant block correlation (CBC) and variable block correlation (VBC), to capture realistic spatial dependence among ports. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), revealing how port reconfiguration strengthens the weakest effective channel and improves SINR through higher channel gains and lower relative noise impact. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis and show that VBC matches simulations more tightly than CBC across all port configurations. Finally, FAS-RSMA provides clear gains over conventional antenna systems and NOMA, achieving lower OP and higher AC by combining RSMA interference management with FAS spatial diversity.",

A distributed observer-based control framework is proposed, within which observer nodes and controller nodes collaboratively perform state estimation and control tasks. Consensus refers to a distributed cooperative mechanism by which each observer node compares its state estimate with those of neighboring nodes, and use the resulting discrepancies to update its own state estimate. One key contribution of this work is to show that the distributed observers and the distributed controllers can be designed independently, which parallels the classical separation principle. This separability within the distributed framework is enabled by a discontinuous consensus strategy and two adaptive algorithms developed specifically for handling the unknown inputs. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving state estimation, stabilization, and tracking control objectives.",

When the emitter is deviated greatly from the normal direction of antenna element or is close to the null-point direction, the sensing energy by array will be seriously attenuated such that the direction-sensing performance is degraded significantly. To address such an issue, a rotatable array system is established with the directive antenna pattern of each element taken into account, where each element has the same antenna pattern. Then, the corresponding the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Finally, a recursive rotation Root-MUSIC (RR-Root-MUSIC) direction-sensing method is proposed and its mean-square-error (MSE) performance is evaluated by the derived CRLB. Simulation results show that the proposed rotation method converges rapidly with about ten iterations, and make a significant enhancement on the direction-sensing accuracy in terms of MSE when the target direction departs seriously far away from the normal vector of array. Compared with conventional Root-MUSIC, the sensing performance of the proposed RR-Root-MUSIC method is much closer to the CRLB.",

    "abstract": "A Low-Power Variable Gain (VG) mm-Wave Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) is designed and simulated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The LNA utilizes a simple, yet novel, technique presented in this paper to vary the small-signal output resistance to provide gain control. The amplifier also utilizes forward body biasing to reduce the supply voltage to 0.7 V and enhance power efficiency. A simultaneous noise and input matching (SNIM) technique is used to provide robust input matching and noise performance during gain adjustment. The proposed VG-LNA achieves a peak gain of 21 dB at 40.5 GHz with a noise figure of 2.8 dB and consumes only 4.5 mW. At the highest gain configuration, an input-referred 1-dB compression of -21 dBm and IP3 of -7.8 dBm are achieved, which increase to -14.8 dBm and 1.2 dBm, respectively, at the lowest gain configuration. Regardless of the gain control voltage, the LNA attains a very good FoM as compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires fast reaction under limited onboard resources. We introduce the distributionally robust acceleration control barrier function (DR-ACBF) as an efficient collision avoidance method maintaining safety regions. The method constructs a second-order control barrier function as linear half-space constraints on commanded acceleration. Latency, actuator limits, and obstacle accelerations are handled through an effective clearance that considers dynamics and delay. Uncertainty is mitigated using Cantelli tightening with per-obstacle risk. A DR-conditional value at risk (DR-CVaR)based early trigger expands margins near violations to improve DOA. Real-time execution is ensured via constant-time Gauss-Southwell projections. Simulation studies achieve similar avoidance performance at substantially lower computational effort than state-of-the-art baseline approaches. Experiments with Crazyflie drones demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the fundamental diffuse scattering mechanisms from three typical building wall surfaces, conducting measurements and model parameterization at 28 GHz and two key FR3 frequencies (8 GHz and 12 GHz). A novel three-dimensional (3D) measurement procedure is proposed to capture comprehensive spatial characteristics, and its effectiveness in improving parameterization accuracy was verified using 28 GHz data. For parameterization, we developed a new method utilizing two dimensions of the high-bandwidth power delay profile-received power and delay spread-thereby fully leveraging the rich information provided by such measurements. Furthermore, we introduce the ER-BK hybrid model, which integrates the Beckmann-Kirchhoff (BK) model's high accuracy and cross-frequency adaptability with the Effective Roughness (ER) model's simplicity, applying it to the building surfaces. Our results show that diffuse scattering at 8 GHz and 12 GHz is highly similar, distinct from that at 28 GHz. A comparison revealed that the BK model provides a better fit for our FR3 measurement data. Crucially, we validated the angular generalization of the parameterized BK model using data from a different incident angle than the one used for fitting. The feasibility of the ER-BK hybrid model was also verified through simulation of the parameterized marble surface.",

We use Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to measure point-wise representation similarity and diffusion distance to capture distributional shifts across SNRs. Results show that the encoder CKA between noisy and clean inputs remains stable and latent and decoder CKA drop sharply as SNR decreases. Linear fits of CKA versus SNR reveal a depth-dependent robustness-sensitivity trade-off. The diffusion distance varies incrementally with SNR within each layer but differs strongly across layers, especially at low SNRs. Together, these findings indicate that noise levels differentially activate model regions and induce distinct inter-layer dynamics, motivating SNR-aware conditioning and refinement strategies for SE.",

However, research in data-driven modeling using machine learning (ML) techniques requires massive amounts of thermal building data, which is not easily available. Neither empirical public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of ML research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. To fill this gap, we present a thermal building data generation framework which we call BuilDa. BuilDa is designed to produce synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for ML research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for a transfer learning study involving the fine-tuning of 486 data-driven models.",

    "abstract": "Lensless cameras replace bulky optics with thin modulation masks, enabling compact imaging systems. However, existing methods rely on an idealized model that assumes a globally shift-invariant point spread function (PSF) and sufficiently large sensors. In reality, the PSF varies spatially across the field of view (FOV), and finite sensor boundaries truncate modulated light--effects that intensify as sensors shrink, degrading peripheral reconstruction quality and limiting the effective FOV. We address these limitations through a local-to-global hierarchical framework grounded in a locally shift-invariant convolution model that explicitly accounts for PSF variation and sensor truncation. Patch-wise learned deconvolution first adaptively estimates local PSFs and reconstructs regions independently. A hierarchical enhancement network then progressively expands its receptive field--from small patches through intermediate blocks to the full image--integrating fine local details with global contextual information. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality over a larger effective FOV with significantly reduced sensor sizes. Under extreme miniaturization--sensors reduced to 8% of the original area--we achieve improvements of 2 dB (PSNR) and 5% (SSIM), with particularly notable gains in structural fidelity.

This survey structures recent progress within a unified Sensor-Perception-Decision (SPD) framework that formalizes how safety emerges from the interaction of distributed sensing, cooperative perception, and coordinated decision-making across vehicles and infrastructure. Rather than centering on link protocols or message formats, we focus on how shared evidence, predictive reasoning, and human-aligned interventions jointly enable proactive risk mitigation. Within this SPD lens, we synthesize advances in cooperative perception, multi-modal forecasting, and risk-aware planning, emphasizing how cross-layer coupling turns isolated detections into calibrated, actionable understanding. Timing, trust, and human factors are identified as cross-cutting constraints that determine whether predictive insights are delivered early enough, with reliable confidence, and in forms that humans and automated controllers can use. Compared with prior V2X safety surveys, this work (i) organizes the literature around a formal SPD safety loop and (ii) systematically analyzes research evolution and evaluation gaps through a PRISMA-guided bibliometric study of hundreds of publications from 2016-2025. The survey concludes with a roadmap toward cooperative safety intelligence, outlining SPD-based design principles and evaluation practices for next-generation V2X safety systems.",

This motivates fast detection and localization of these emitters using low-cost, distributed sensors that do not require precise time synchronization. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches for multi-emitter detection and localization from sparsely sampled power maps. The first method performs single-stage prediction of existence probabilities and positions. The alternative two-stage method first estimates an occupancy map as an interpretable intermediate representation and then localizes emitters. A unified training objective combines binary cross entropy with coordinate regression loss and can handle an unknown emitter count. Small footprint networks, on the order of 70\\,k parameters, are trained and evaluated on simulated free-space and urban scenes. Experiments demonstrate that both approaches localize multiple emitters from sparse measurements across diverse environments, with the logits based two-stage variant remaining competitive, and in some cases superior, under extreme sensor sparsity. The findings indicate that small CNNs with a unified objective can be deployed for spectrum monitoring and localization.",

    "abstract": "The North American commercial electric vehicle (EV) sector is undergoing rapid expansion, with unit sales rising from 21,120 in 2022 to 36,491 in 2023 - a 73% increase, according to the International Energy Agency. However, this accelerating adoption brings emerging technical challenges. One critical concern is the impact of low to extreme winter temperatures (25 degree F to -25 degree F) on EV performance, including reduced energy efficiency and extended charging times. This paper presents a systematic analysis of commercial EV performance degradation under cold weather conditions and its broader implications on grid operations. Monte Carlo simulations, applied using real-world fleet parameters, indicate that approximately 200 MWh of additional daily energy demand may be required in the U.S. alone to offset efficiency losses during severe cold events. The resulting strain on an already stressed winter grid could exacerbate reliability risks. Moreover, increased harmonic distortion associated with cold weather charging behaviors has also been observed, raising concerns about power quality. To address these challenges, this study proposes two practical mitigation strategies: (1) a 'design-integrated safety' battery swapping station model operating in thermally controlled environments to significantly reduce charging downtime, and (2) a hybrid architecture combining roadside fast charging with depot-based deep charging to support continuous fleet utilization without compromising range. Together, these interventions provide a robust foundation for resilient commercial EV integration in cold climates, supporting fleet operators and utilities in managing seasonal performance variability.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Motor Execution (ME) and Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer a direct pathway for human-machine interaction. However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.",

Deep learning enables the design of nonlinear feedback codes that are more resilient to feedback noise. We extend single-user learned feedback codes for the AWGN channel to the broadcast setting, and compare their performance with existing analytical codes, as well as a newly proposed analytical scheme inspired by the learned schemes.

The resulting GFM control achieves fast current limiting while preserving transient stability, e.g., exhibiting infinite critical clearing time. To develop the control, we first characterize and analyze the set of converter voltages that do not result in constraint violations. Next, an efficient algorithm for projecting voltages onto the feasible set is developed. Subsequently, these results are used to restrict the dynamics of GFM droop control to the set of feasible voltages.

This letter introduces three deterministic pruning rules that exploit QAM-grid symmetry and relative displacement between the ZF estimate and the nearby QAM points to eliminate unlikely branches, avoiding metric sorting and reducing full metric distance calculations. Simulations show large complexity savings with only a small impact on error performance.

This chapter addresses the following fundamental questions on near-field operation: (i) What is the maximum distance where far-field approximations remain effective for path gain prediction and beam design? (ii) What level of position resolution is needed for accurate near-field beam focusing? (iii) How frequently must channel state information be updated to maintain highly directive bweamforming in dynamic scenarios? We develop an analytical framework for assessing near-field beamforming gain degradation due to mismatches between the focusing point and the coordinates of a user. Closed-form expressions for beam correlation, beam sensitivity to user movement, and the direction of fastest beamforming gain degradation are derived. A dynamic polar coordinate grid is also proposed for low complexity and adaptive near-field beam search. Furthermore, we introduce the novel concept of beam coherence time, quantifying the temporal robustness of focused beams and enabling proactive sensing-aided beam tracking strategies. The effect of microstrip losses on the preceding derivations is also analyzed.

The content delivery tenant needs to guarantee that each of its clients (users) receives the required content, the sensing tenant aims to gather an adequate amount of uncorrelated data, and the MEC tenant provides computing service to its clients. An energy consumption minimization framework is considered to meet the tenants' requirements by optimizing the number of deployed UAVs, the deployment location of each UAV, the transmit power of each deployed UAV, the user-UAV association, and the transmission power as well as the computing resources of each UAV. Taking into account the spatial correlation among the sensing users, a subset of these users is activated to gather the required sensing information. A solution approach technique inherited from graph theory is presented, in which the Lagrange approach derives the transmission power and computing resource allocation expressions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the total energy consumption.",

    "title": "Active Learning of Fractional-Order Viscoelastic Model Parameters for Realistic Haptic Rendering",
    "abstract": "Effective medical simulators necessitate realistic haptic rendering of biological tissues that display viscoelastic material properties, such as creep and stress relaxation. Fractional-order models provide an effective means of describing intrinsically time-dependent viscoelastic dynamics with few parameters, as these models can naturally capture memory effects. However, due to the unintuitive frequency-dependent coupling between the order of the fractional element and the other parameters, determining appropriate parameters for fractional-order models that yield high perceived realism remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a systematic means of determining the parameters of fractional-order viscoelastic models that optimizes the perceived realism of haptic rendering across general populations. First, we demonstrate that the parameters of fractional-order models can be effectively optimized through active learning, via qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop~(HiL) optimizations, to ensure consistently high realism ratings for each individual. Second, we propose a rigorous method to combine HiL optimization results to form an aggregate perceptual map trained on the entire dataset and demonstrate the selection of population-level optimal parameters from this representation that are broadly perceived as realistic across general populations. Finally, we provide evidence of the effectiveness of the generalized fractional-order viscoelastic model parameters by characterizing their perceived realism through human-subject experiments. Overall, generalized fractional-order viscoelastic models established through the proposed HiL optimization and aggregation approach possess the potential to significantly improve the sim-to-real transition performance of medical training simulators.",

    "abstract": "The transition from 5G to 6G requires radio channel models that are frequency-continuous across the entire FR1--FR3 span, particularly in the under-explored 4--8 GHz region targeted by WRC-27. Existing 3GPP-style models are often specified at discrete frequencies, introducing discontinuities in large-scale parameters (LSPs) at the 7.125 GHz boundary. To address this, we develop a unified framework anchored by rigorous double-directional measurements at 4.85 GHz in three representative UMa/UMi layouts. We derive route-specific statistics for path loss, delay and angular spreads, K-factor, and spatial consistency using robust distance-binning and bootstrap processing. Subsequently, we construct a log-log frequency-continuous LSP model spanning 4.85 to 28 GHz by anchoring these local statistics to complementary high-frequency datasets. The resulting models ensure smoothness across 7.125 GHz and systematically deviate from 3GPP trends, capturing weaker dispersion in urban macrocells (UMa) and stronger frequency-dependent compaction in urban microcells (UMi). The proposed parameter set fills the measurement gap around 4.85 GHz and provides a practical, implementation-ready basis for wideband 5G/6G simulations, mobility evaluation, and spectrum-planning activities across the FR1--FR3 interface.",

Our influence predictor is trained offline using influence coefficients computed via the Datamodel framework across diverse MPPI instances, and is then deployed online for efficient sample pruning and adaptive constraint handling. A single learned model simultaneously addresses efficiency and safety: low-influence samples are pruned to reduce computational cost, while monitoring the influence of constraint-violating samples enables adaptive penalty tuning.

    "abstract": "Recent successful lunar landing missions have generated significant interest among space agencies in establishing a permanent human settlement on the Moon. Building a lunar base requires multiple and frequent landing missions to support logistics and mobility applications. In these missions, maximizing payload mass defined as the useful cargo for human settlement is crucial. The landing mass depends on several factors, with the most critical being the maximum thrust available for braking and the engine's specific impulse (ISP). Generally, increasing engine thrust for braking reduces flight duration and, consequently, gravity losses. However, higher thrust also introduces trade-offs, such as increased engine weight and lower ISP, which can negatively impact payload capacity. Therefore, optimizing the descent trajectory requires careful consideration of these parameters to achieve a global solution that maximizes payload mass. Most existing research focuses on solving optimal control problems that minimize propellant consumption for a given thrust. These problems are typically addressed through trajectory optimization, where a minimum-fuel solution is obtained. The optimized trajectory is then executed onboard using polynomial guidance. In this paper, we propose an outer-layer optimization approach based on a Pareto-optimal solution. This method iterates on the maximum available thrust for descent trajectory optimization while incorporating a loss function that accounts for engine mass and ISP losses. By applying this approach, we identify a globally optimal solution that maximizes payload mass while ensuring an optimal landing trajectory.",

However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform.",

The selected beams feed a sparse beamspace Unitary ESPRIT stage, so that the overall complexity is dominated by a single low-dimensional ESPRIT call while retaining a large effective aperture. Monte Carlo simulations for a 32-element uniform linear array with three paths show that, relative to a standard sectorization-based beam selector built on the same DFT codebook and ESPRIT estimator, the proposed method attains near Cramér--Rao bound accuracy at moderate array signal-to-noise ratios, substantially reduces the gap to the bound and the failure rate, and offers favorable accuracy--runtime trade-offs under dynamic RF budgets and sector-edge stress tests.",

This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE>1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.",

Traditional PI controllers often struggle due to inherent system delays, nonlinear dynamics, and static gain limitations. This paper introduces a fault-tolerant temperature control framework by integrating a PI plus feedforward control strategy with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The feedforward component anticipates disturbances, preemptively adjusting control actions, while the PINN adaptively tunes control gains in real-time, embedding thermodynamic constraints to manage varying operating conditions and valve leakage faults. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis confirms the asymptotic convergence of temperature tracking errors under bounded leakage conditions. Simulation results using operational data from the Pareh-Sar combined cycle power plant demonstrate significantly improved response times, reduced temperature deviations, enhanced fault resilience, and smooth gain adjustments. The proposed adaptive, data-driven methodology shows strong potential for industrial deployment, ensuring reliable operation, autonomous fault recovery, and enhanced performance in HRSG systems.",

Yet, their inherent weakness at representing the likelihood of the observation (which often leads to particle degeneracy) remains unaddressed for high-frequency and resource-constrained systems. Improvements such as the optimal proposal and auxiliary particle filter mitigate this issue under specific circumstances and with increased computational cost. This work presents a new particle filtering method and its implementation, which enables tunably-approximative representation of arbitrary likelihood densities as program transformations of parametric distributions. Our method leverages a recent computing platform that can perform deterministic computation on probability distribution representations (UxHw) without relying on stochastic methods. For non-Gaussian non-linear systems and with an optimal-auxiliary particle filter, we benchmark the likelihood evaluation error and speed for a total of 294840 evaluation points. For such models, the results show that the UxHw method leads to as much as 37.7x speedup compared to the Monte Carlo alternative. For narrow uniform observation noise, the particle filter falsely assigns zero likelihood as much as 81.89% of the time whereas UxHw achieves 1.52% false-zero rate. The UxHw approach achieves filter RMSE improvement of as much as 18.9% (average 3.3%) over the Monte Carlo alternative.",

    "abstract": "Accurate remote state estimation is a fundamental component of many autonomous and networked dynamical systems, where multiple decision-making agents interact and communicate over shared, bandwidth-constrained channels. These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy.",

However, even limited weed infestation can severely compromise cactus productivity, as the species are highly sensitive to competition for essential resources, which includes water, mineral nutrients, and sun exposure. Conventional herbicide-based weed control strategies face growing limitations due to resistance development and environmental concerns, underscoring the need for sustainable alternatives. This study revisits the historically underexplored application of linear Fresnel lenses for thermal weed control and establishes the technical feasibility of a contemporary autonomous weed management system that incorporates LFL technology within an unmanned ground vehicle platform. Leveraging real-time image processing, georeferencing, and mechanical actuation, the system can perform a two-phase operation-weed mapping during non-optimal solar hours and targeted solar termination during peak irradiance. Analytical modeling quantifies the effective area coverage and time constraints imposed by the solar window. Preliminary results indicate that, while unsuitable for dense weed infestations, the system presents a viable solution for precision, post-emergent weed control in sparse infestations. The favorable solar geometry in tropical zones, especially in the Brazilian semiarid region, and the targeted nature of the approach make this technology particularly well-suited for sustainable agriculture in under-resourced regions.",

Most MC literature focuses on particle properties, even though many natural phenomena exhibit wave-like behavior. One such signal is sound waves. Understanding how sound waves are used in nature can help us better utilize this signal in our interactions with our environment. To take a step in this direction, in this paper, we examine how plants process incoming sound waves and take informed actions. Indeed, plants respond to sound, yet no quantitative communication-theoretic model currently explains this behavior. This study develops the first end-to-end acoustic communication framework for plants. The model is formed following the biological steps of the incoming signal, and a mathematical description is constructed at each step following basic biological models. The resulting end-to-end communication-theoretic model is analyzed using MATLAB. Simulations show that a $200$ $Hz$, $20$ $mu Pa$ stimulus elevates cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ from $150$ $nM$ to $230 \\pm 10$ $nM$ within $50$ seconds which can cause root bending in plants in the long run.

We show that a particular decentralized Control Barrier Function based algorithm executes lane swaps efficiently, with minimal speed change, within the specified (short) road segment at high traffic densities (3,500 vehicles per hour per lane). Our main point is that controller tuning, the speed of inter-agent instability, plays a major role in the performance of the vehicle group. This is illustrated by comparing two different tunings of the controller and a third one where the lane swap is enforced by virtual guard rails. Like fighter jet dynamic instability improving maneuverability, the inter-agent instability improves agility of a group of vehicles. We emphasize that the controllers considered are decentralized: agents do not know if others want to change lanes or not.",

Prior work showed how to recognize and properly treat a global bus structure. In this paper we leverage this work from global to local bus structures through a novel multilevel discrete-event system (MLDES) architecture. Specifically, the hierarchical system decomposition is revisited by allowing bus detection not only on the top level but at each level of the system hierarchy. Given this architecture, an algorithm is introduced that constructs a tree-structured MLDES.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic engineering makes use of mixed-signal analog and digital circuits to directly emulate the computational principles of biological brains. Such electronic systems offer a high degree of adaptability, robustness, and energy efficiency across a wide range of tasks, from edge computing to robotics. Within this context, we investigate a key feature of biological neurons: their ability to carry out robust and reliable computation by adapting their input response and spiking pattern to context through neuromodulation. Achieving analogous levels of robustness and adaptation in neuromorphic circuits through modulatory mechanisms is a largely unexplored path. We present a novel current-mode neuron design that supports robust neuromodulation with minimal model complexity, compatible with standard CMOS technologies. We first introduce a mathematical model of the circuit and provide tools to analyze and tune the neuron behavior; we then demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the biologically plausible neuromodulation adaptation capabilities of the circuit over a wide range of parameters. All the theoretical predictions were verified in experiments on a low-power 180 nm CMOS implementation of the proposed neuron circuit. Due to the analog underlying feedback structure, the proposed adaptive neuromodulable neuron exhibits a high degree of robustness, flexibility, and scalability across operating ranges of currents and temperatures, making it a perfect candidate for real-world neuromorphic applications.",

    "abstract": "Multi-echo Gradient Echo (mGRE) sequences provide valuable quantitative parametric maps, such as Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) and transverse relaxation rate (R2*), sensitive to tissue iron and myelin. However, structural morphometry typically relies on separate T1-weighted MPRAGE acquisitions, prolonging scan times. We propose a deep learning framework to synthesize high-contrast 3D T1w MPRAGE images directly from mGRE data, streamlining neuroimaging protocols. We developed a novel multi-parametric conditional diffusion model based on the Fast-DDPM architecture. Unlike conventional intensity-based synthesis, our approach integrates iron-sensitive QSM and R2* maps as physical priors to address contrast ambiguity in iron-rich deep gray matter. We trained and validated the model on 175 healthy subjects. Performance was evaluated against established U-Net and GAN-based baselines using perceptual metrics and downstream segmentation accuracy. Uniquely, we assessed the biological plausibility of synthesized images by replicating population-level statistical associations with age and sex. The proposed framework significantly outperformed baselines, achieving superior perceptual quality and segmentation accuracy, particularly in subcortical regions like the thalamus and pallidum. Crucially, synthesized images preserved essential biological dependencies: regression analyses showed high concordance in age-related atrophy rates, aging effect sizes, and sexual dimorphism patterns compared to ground truth. By effectively leveraging quantitative MRI priors, our diffusion-based method generates strictly biologically plausible T1w images suitable for reliable clinical morphometric analysis. This approach offers a promising pathway to reduce acquisition time by deriving structural contrasts retrospectively from quantitative mGRE sequences.",

The pipeline involves synthetic images used by the non-iterative horizon-based OPNAV algorithm, fed into an extended Kalman filter. The state estimate is used by a controller to maintain the spacecraft's motion within the vicinity of a reference NRHO. We study differential correction-based and minimization-based implementations of the x-axis crossing control scheme, and propose an improved targeting prediction scheme by incorporating the filter's state covariance with an unscented transform. We also introduce a hysteresis mechanism, which improves station-keeping cost and provides insight into the difference in performance between the differential correction-based and minimization-based approaches. We perform Monte-Carlo experiments to assess the pipeline's tracking and {\\Delta}V performances. We report several key findings, including the variability of the filter performance with the sensor field of view and measurement locations, station-keeping cost reduction achieved by the unscented transform-based prediction and hysteresis, as well as variability of the cumulative {\\Delta}V as a function of maneuver location due to the periodic structure in the OPNAV-based filter's estimation accuracy.",

When applied recursively, this predictor forms a dynamic system representation. This data-driven representation is generally non-minimal, containing latent poles in addition to the system's original poles. In this article, we show that these latent poles are guaranteed to be stable through the use of the Moore-Penrose inverses of the data matrices, regardless of the system's stability and even in the presence of small noise in data. This result obviates the need to eliminate the latent poles through procedures that resort to low-rank approximation in data-driven control and analysis. It is then applied to construct a stabilizable and detectable realization from data, from which we design an output feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. Furthermore, we extend this principle to data-driven inversion, enabling asymptotic unknown input estimation for minimum-phase systems.",

    "abstract": "Radio resource management in modern cellular networks often calls for the optimization of complex utility functions that are potentially conflicting between different base stations (BSs). Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technological paradigm for sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, aiming to unify sensing and communication in a spectrally efficient and hardware lightweight manner. Radio frequency ISAC (RF-ISAC) is constrained by spectrum crowding, limited sensing resolution, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In contrast, optical ISAC (O-ISAC) leverages the large bandwidth and short wavelength of optical carriers and is regarded as an important complement to RF-ISAC. However, conventional O-ISAC relies on natural optical reflections from target surfaces, which generate weak echoes that are highly dependent on surface materials, thereby limiting the achievable sensing range and sensing accuracy. This article introduces retroreflective optical ISAC (RO-ISAC), which alleviates these limitations by equipping targets with compact retroreflective modules. These modules return incident light approximately back to the source over a useful range of incidence angles, forming a well controlled double pass optical path with strong and stable echoes, and thereby further unlocking the application potential of O-ISAC. The conceptual architecture of RO-ISAC is presented together with the underlying retroreflection mechanism. Key enabling technologies for RO-ISAC systems are discussed, including channel modeling, waveform design, bidirectional transmission, and multi-target sensing and communication, with representative details and experimental validation. The suitability of RO-ISAC is analyzed in indoor, aerial, underwater, and satellite scenarios, and challenges and research directions related to mobility, cooperative networking, intelligent operation, and sustainable deployment are outlined, pointing toward robust and scalable RO-ISAC deployment in future 6G networks.",

    "abstract": "Reliable health assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries is essential for safe and economically viable second-life deployment, yet remains difficult due to sparse measurements, incomplete historical records, heterogeneous chemistries, and limited or noisy battery health labels. Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden. Looking forward, progress toward physically constrained generative models, cross-chemistry generalization, calibrated uncertainty estimation, and standardized benchmarks will be crucial for building reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready health prediction tools tailored to the realities of retired-battery applications.",

    "abstract": "Extending terrestrial networks into low-altitude airspace is a practical way to support aerial services, and accurate low-altitude radio maps are essential for characterizing terrestrial base station (BS) coverage and guiding system design. This work targets per-cell per-beam radio mapping from 5G new radio (NR) synchronization signal (SS) burst sets. Conventional processing treats interference as noise and focuses on the strongest link, which is insufficient to comprehensive awareness of the radio environment and ineffective in dense multi-cell low-altitude scenarios. We propose a successive waveform reconstruction and cancellation framework that iteratively estimates, reconstructs, and subtracts the SSs of stronger BSs, thereby enabling reliable detection and estimation of ultra-weak signals. To support this, we introduce the notion of a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-coherent block within which a common-CFO/per-synchronization signal block (SSB)-channel model holds and design a joint CFO-channel estimator that coherently aggregates multiple SSBs within each CFO-coherent block. We further derive closed-form scaling laws that relate estimation accuracy to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) speed, motion geometry, burst periodicity, and the length of the CFO-coherent block. Simulations show that the proposed framework can detect and estimate SSs at signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) levels down to -30 dB. Field tests at 150 m altitude demonstrate per-beam coverage maps for more than ten overlapping BSs and reveal that, despite strong received power, the measured SINR rarely exceeds 10 dB, underscoring the need for careful interference management in low-altitude airspace.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding \"in-between\" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.",

Radio map is a spatial representation of signal characteristics across different locations in a given area, which serves as a key tool for enabling precise spectrum management. To generate accurate radio maps, extensive research efforts have been made. However, most existing studies are conducted on simulation data, which differs significantly from real-world data and cannot accurately reflect the spectrum characteristics of practical environments. To tackle this problem, we construct a dataset of real-world radio map with a self-developed measurement system. Due to the limited volume of real-world data and the distributional discrepancies between simulation and real-world data, we propose a Pixel Transformer (PiT)- based model enhanced with the test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, named RadioPiT, for real-world radio map generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RadioPiT significantly outperforms baseline methods in real-world scenarios, yielding a 21.9% decrement in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to RadioUNet.",

    "abstract": "In audio signal processing applications with a microphone and a loudspeaker within the same acoustic environment, the loudspeaker signals can feed back into the microphone, thereby creating a closed-loop system that potentially leads to system instability. To remove this acoustic coupling, prediction error method (PEM) feedback cancellation algorithms aim to identify the feedback path between the loudspeaker and the microphone by assuming that the input signal can be modelled by means of an autoregressive (AR) model. It has previously been shown that this PEM framework and resulting algorithms can identify the feedback path correctly in cases where the forward path from microphone to loudspeaker is sufficiently time-varying or non-linear, or when the forward path delay equals or exceeds the order of the AR model. In this paper, it is shown that this delay-based condition can be generalised for one particular PEM-based algorithm, the so-called two-channel adaptive feedback canceller (2ch-AFC), to an invertibility-based condition, for which it is shown that identifiability can be achieved when the order of the forward path feedforward filter exceeds the order of the AR model.

    "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated the ability to perform \\textit{in-context learning} (ICL), whereby the model performs predictions by directly mapping the query and a few examples from the given task to the output variable. In this paper, we study ICL for deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) in image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where an ICL denoiser is employed for MIMO symbol estimation. We first study the transceiver without any hardware impairments and explore the integration of transformer-based ICL with DeepJSCC in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. For both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios, we propose two MIMO transceiver architectures that leverage context information, i.e., pilot sequences and their outputs, as additional inputs, enabling the DeepJSCC encoder, DeepJSCC decoder, and the ICL denoiser to jointly learn encoding, decoding, and estimation strategies tailored to each channel realization. Next, we extend our study to a more challenging scenario where the transceiver suffers from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance, resulting in nonlinear MIMO estimation. In this case, the context information is also exploited, facilitating joint learning across the DeepJSCC encoder, decoder, and the ICL denoiser under hardware impairments and varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the ICL denoiser for MIMO estimation significantly outperforms the conventional least-squares method, with even greater advantages under IQ imbalance. Moreover, the proposed transformer-based ICL framework, integrated with contextual information, achieves significant improvements in end-to-end image reconstruction quality under transceiver IQ imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).",

    "abstract": "Microelectronic devices in modern systems are working continuously for prolonged periods of many years. Thus, there is a crucial need for reliability model that will enable us to predict precisely the life cycle of the device and point out on the governing failure mechanisms that are responsible for degradation and failure. This is even more important when high power and frequency devices, especially Normally Off Switch Power transistors are concerned, since the reliability research on those devices lay far behind that of low power digital devices. Our main goal in our lab is to investigate the failure mechanisms of GaN transistors, aimed at determining the reliability factors of the innovative MTOL model. The main goal is to understand the reason for the transformation of the failure mechanism. Employing the recorded data may enable us to predict the performance and life time of the device at different operation parameters such as current, voltage, frequency and temperatures. In this study we employ a new different use for the well-known boost convertor circuit, based on GaN Devices in order to stress the transistor to the maximum values of voltage and current which allows us to examine the reliability of the transistor and accelerating Hot Carrier And Trap Generation failures mechanisms. The acceleration of the failure mechanism should be done in a way that will not affect the electronic device detrimentally and on the other hand we would not need to wait a long time in order to observe the degradation. In this work we will present our new boost converter circuit based on high power GaN HEMT.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to automate or support the commissioning of engineering systems is rising. Conventional BO, however, relies on the availability of a scalar objective function. The latter is often difficult to define and rarely captures the nuanced judgement of expert operators in industrial settings. Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) addresses this limitation by relying solely on pairwise preference feedback of a human expert, so-called duels. In this paper, we study PBO's capacity to commission a particular setup where a manipulator needs to push a block towards a target position. We benchmark state-of-the-art algorithms in both simulations and in the real world. Our results confirm that PBO can commission the set-up to the satisfaction of an expert operator whilst relying solely on binary preference feedback. To evaluate to what extend the same result can be achieved using conventional BO we investigate the experts decision consistency against an expert-designed cost function. Our study reveals that the experts fail to define a cost function that is in full agreement with their own decision process as witnessed in the PBO experiments. We then show that the auxiliary cost function that is constructed as a by-product of the PBO algorithms outperforms the expert-designed cost function in terms of decision consistency. Furthermore we demonstrate that this cost function can be used with conventional BO algorithms in an effort to reproduce the optimal design. This proofs the preference based cost function captures the experts' preferences perhaps more effectively than the experts could articulate preference themselves. In conclusion, we discuss downsides and propose directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.",

Specifically, 1-bit samples of the radio-frequency signal are exchanged over the fronthaul. We investigate via both measurements and simulations based on an accurate model of the testbed hardware, the capability of the proposed architecture to provide uniform quality of services over the coverage area--one of the promises of D-MIMO. Our results are encouraging: for the case in which two user equipments (UEs) communicate over the same 75MHz signal bandwidth, the measured error-vector magnitude meets the 3GPP New Radio specification of 12.5\\% for 16QAM across all tested DMIMO scenarios. We also determine that uplink transmission is a potential bottleneck, due to the limited dynamic range of the automatic gain controller, which prevents the 1-bit quantizer to benefit from dithering. We show that this issue can be mitigated via UE power control.",

    "abstract": "The high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) reduces system inertia, leading to frequency stability concerns, especially during synchronous generator (SG) outages. To maintain frequency dynamics within secure limits while ensuring economic efficiency, frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) is employed. However, existing studies either neglect the frequency support capability and allocation of grid-forming (GFM) IBRs or suffer from limited accuracy in representing frequency dynamics due to model simplifications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based FCOPF (DL-FCOPF) framework. A DL model is first developed as a predictor to accurately estimate frequency-related metrics: the required reserved headroom and allocation of GFM IBRs, the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir. After being trained with data obtained from electromagnetic transient simulations, the DL model is reformulated and incorporated into FCOPF. Case studies conducted on two test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the traditional OPF and linear FCOPF benchmarks, the DL-FCOPF can optimally coordinate SGs and IBRs with minimum cost, achieving desired frequency response, within an acceptable computing time. Further-more, sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the most suit-able structure and linearization approach of the DL-based frequency predictor.",

To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance. Moreover, we identify the ray-tracing accuracy as the most critical factor in digital twin fidelity that impacts the learned codebook performance.",

    "abstract": "Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating \"trend-driven\" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\\sim3\\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks ( this https URL ). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.",

This paper presents a comparative study for selecting metrics for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for net load profiles of residential, industrial, and office buildings under increased DER penetration. A variety of statistical metrics is evaluated for their usefulness in quantifying un- certainty, including, but not limited to, standard deviation, entropy, ramps, and distance metrics. The proposed metrics are classified into baseline-free, with baseline and error-based. These UQ metrics are evaluated for increased penetration of EV and PV. The results highlight suitable metrics to quantify uncertainty per consumer type and demonstrate how net load uncertainty is affected by EV and PV adoption. Additionally, it is observed that joint consideration of EV and PV can reduce overall uncertainty due to compensatory effects of EV charging and PV generation due to temporal alignment during the day. Uncertainty reduction is observed across all datasets and is most pronounced for the office building dataset.",

Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption.

To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example. We show that by integrating the process of information gathering (i.e., uncertainty reduction) and process optimization, this approach has the potential to consistently perform better than traditional approaches at maximizing an overall objective, such as net present value (NPV). Our methodological demonstration of this optimization-under-uncertainty approach for a synthetic case provides a mathematical and computational framework for later real-world application, with the potential to improve both the laboratory-scale design of experiments and industrial-scale operation of mineral processing circuits without any additional hardware.",

    "abstract": "Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations.",

A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response.

Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle \\psi of a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \\pm 5^\\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents.",

Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.",

    "abstract": "Digital neuromorphic processors are emerging as a promising computing substrate for low-power, always-on EdgeAI applications. In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads. It does not present new experimental results; instead, it synthesizes and contextualizes findings previously reported in our SENECA publications to provide a coherent, step-by-step architectural perspective for students and practitioners who wish to design their own digital neuromorphic processors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate material recognition is critical for safe and effective laser cutting, as misidentification can lead to poor cut quality, machine damage, or the release of hazardous fumes. Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.",

However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.",

Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.",

Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \\textit{uncertainty} and detect \\textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.",

Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.",

Existing solutions often rely on monolithic or layered combinations of hypervisors and guest OSes, which are difficult to tailor for the diverse and dynamic requirements of edge scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TenonOS, a demand-driven, self-generating, and lightweight operating system framework that fundamentally rethinks and reconstructs both the hypervisor and OS architectures. TenonOS introduces a novel LibOS-on-LibOS approach, in which both virtualization and OS functionalities are modularized into fine-grained, reusable micro-libraries. A dynamic orchestration engine composes these modules on demand to construct customized, application-specific runtime environments. At the core of TenonOS are two key components: Mortise, a minimal, modularized hypervisor, and Tenon, a real-time LibOS. Mortise provides low-overhead resource isolation, fast inter-VM communication, and manages the full lifecycle of Tenon instances - including on-demand creation, suspension, and termination - enabling TenonOS to flexibly adapt its runtime layout to workload variations. Tenon delivers deterministic scheduling and multi-process support for time-critical applications. Through this unified and modular architecture, TenonOS eliminates redundant layers, reduces system overhead, and enhances scalability, security, and maintainability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TenonOS achieves superior real-time scheduling (40.28% improvement), a compact memory footprint (361 KiB), and high adaptability to dynamic edge workloads, making it an ideal foundation for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge systems.",

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.",

    "title": "Integrating Causal Foundation Model in Prescriptive Maintenance Framework for Optimizing Production Line OEE",
    "abstract": "The transition to prescriptive maintenance in manufacturing is critically constrained by a dependence on predictive models. These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a \"what-if\" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes.",

    "title": "Bayesian dynamic scheduling of multipurpose batch processes under incomplete look-ahead information",
    "abstract": "Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.",

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.",

We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators.

    "abstract": "Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.",

    "abstract": "Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.",

However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models.

Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.",

This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty.

Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.",

We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample.

    "abstract": "Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

    "abstract": "In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.",

We will take into account prior knowledge on system-theoretic properties of the system, in particular, controllability and stabilizability. For this, we extend the notion of universal inputs to incorporate prior knowledge on the system.

Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics.",

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.",

Accurate stock price predictions can help traders make better investment decisions, leading to increased profits. In this article, we trained and tested a Hidden Markov Model for the purpose of predicting a stock closing price based on its opening price and the preceding day's prices.

    "abstract": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.",

However, previous studies on 3D CT generation primarily focus on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast and have yet to fully capitalize on the benefits of both semantic and textual conditions. In this paper, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework based on easily-acquired text prompts to generate anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; an anatomy-aware high-dynamic-range (HDR) autoencoder for high-fidelity feature extraction across varying intensity levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. Combined, these components enable data synthesis for segmentation tasks from only textual instructions. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.

The aggregate power consumption of a TCL fleet can be controlled by adjusting thermostat setpoints. An ex-ante quantification of the flexibility that results from such setpoint change can inform grid operator decisions. This paper develops a rigorous, yet practical method to quantify flexibility in terms of the `reach-and-hold' set of TCL aggregations, which defines how much power can be shifted (reach) and for how long (hold). To quantify the reach-and-hold set, we employ a Markov-chain-based model of the TCL aggregation that captures second-order TCL dynamics, enabling accurate characterization of reach-and-hold sets. A tractable optimization problem is then formulated to numerically compute an inner approximation of these sets. Simulation results validate that our method accurately characterizes the fleet's flexibility and effectively controls its power consumption. Furthermore, a robustness analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of uncertainty in initial conditions and TCL parameters.",

    "abstract": "Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multispectral images (MSIs) using a single coded two-dimensional (2-D) measurement, but reconstructing high-fidelity MSIs from these compressed inputs remains a fundamentally ill-posed challenge. While diffusion-based reconstruction methods have recently raised the bar for quality, they face critical limitations: a lack of large-scale MSI training data, adverse domain shifts from RGB-pretrained models, and inference inefficiencies due to multi-step sampling. These drawbacks restrict their practicality in real-world applications. In contrast to existing methods, which either follow costly iterative refinement or adapt subspace-based embeddings for diffusion models (e.g. DiffSCI, PSR-SCI), we introduce a fundamentally different paradigm: a self-supervised One-Step Diffusion (OSD) framework specifically designed for SCI. The key novelty lies in using a single-step diffusion refiner to correct an initial reconstruction, eliminating iterative denoising entirely while preserving generative quality. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised equivariant learning strategy to train both the predictor and refiner directly from raw 2-D measurements, enabling generalization to unseen domains without the need for ground-truth MSI. To further address the challenge of limited MSI data, we design a band-selection-driven distillation strategy that transfers core generative priors from large-scale RGB datasets, effectively bridging the domain gap. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach sets a new benchmark, yielding PSNR gains of 3.44 dB, 1.61 dB, and 0.28 dB on the Harvard, NTIRE, and ICVL datasets, respectively, while reducing reconstruction time by 97.5%. This remarkable improvement in efficiency and adaptability makes our method a significant advancement in SCI reconstruction, combining both accuracy and practicality for real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Recent approaches have focused on developing data-driven models that attempt to preserve invariant statistics over long horizons since many chaotic systems exhibit dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Despite the recent progress in such models, they are still often prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce a modular framework that provides formal guarantees of trajectory boundedness for neural network chaotic dynamics models. Our core contribution is a dissipative projection layer that leverages control-theoretic principles to ensure the learned system is dissipative. Specifically, our framework simultaneously learns a dynamics emulator and an energy-like function, where the latter is used to construct an algebraic dissipative constraint within the projection layer. Furthermore, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the system's strange attractor, which is known to be difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate our model's ability to produce bounded long-horizon forecasts that preserve invariant statistics for chaotic dynamical systems, including Lorenz 96 and a reduced-order model of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.",

Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structural information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation for segmentation and classification.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which depends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local functions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only has access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual leader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players' cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.",

However, real-world deployments face various dynamic factors, such as fluctuating electricity prices and uncertain EV departure times, that hinder effective energy management. To address these issues and minimize building electricity costs while meeting EV charging requirements, we design a hierarchical multi-agent structure in which a high-level agent coordinates overall charge or discharge decisions based on real-time pricing, while multiple low-level agents manage individual power level accordingly. For uncertain EV departure times, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware critic augmentation mechanism for low-level agents that improves the evaluation of power-level decisions and ensures robust control under such uncertainty. Building upon these two key designs, we introduce HUCA, a real-time charging control framework that coordinates energy supply among the building and EVs. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets show that HUCA significantly reduces electricity costs and maintains competitive performance in meeting EV charging requirements under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios. The results further highlight the importance of hierarchical control and the proposed critic augmentation under the uncertain departure scenario. A case study illustrates HUCA's capability to allocate energy between the building and EVs in real time, underscoring its potential for practical use.",

The Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT) computes a constellation of Continuous Fractional Wavelet Transforms (CFWTs) aligned to different local time-frequency curvatures. This constellation is combined into a single optimised time-frequency energy representation via a localised entropy-based sparsity measure, designed to resolve auto-terms and attenuate cross-terms. Finally, a positivity-constrained Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with total-variation regularisation is applied to estimate the ITFR, achieving auto-term resolution comparable to that of the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), yielding the high-resolution RIFT representation. The required Cohen's class convolutional kernels are fully derived in the paper for the chosen CFWT constellations. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction (IPD) field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories and the construction of the Spline-RIFT variant. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world signals demonstrates the algorithm's ability to effectively suppress cross-terms and achieve superior time-frequency precision relative to competing methods. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.",

Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility.

Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of SpeechShield hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement SpeechShield on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. SpeechShield with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. SpeechShield is 16x smaller in memory, 3.3x faster and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by introducing an explainability tool for spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, this tools retrieves the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compares it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We apply our tool on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. The tool reveals that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at this https URL .",

Manual delineation of gliomas is time-consuming and prone to variability, motivating the use of deep learning to improve consistency and alleviate clinical workload. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the information available in multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), particularly inter-slice contextual features, and typically require considerable computational resources while lacking robustness across tumor type variations. We present GBT-SAM, a parameter-efficient deep learning framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale vision model, to volumetric mp-MRI data. GBT-SAM reduces input complexity by selecting fewer than 2.6\\% of slices per scan while incorporating all four MRI modalities, preserving essential tumor-related information with minimal cost. Furthermore, our model is trained by a two-step fine-tuning strategy that incorporates a depth-aware module to capture inter-slice correlations and lightweight adaptation layers, resulting in just 6.5M trainable parameters, which is the lowest among SAM-based approaches. GBT-SAM achieves a Dice Score of 93.54 on the BraTS Adult Glioma dataset and demonstrates robust performance on Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets.

    "abstract": "Structured state-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful architecture at the intersection of machine learning and control, featuring layers composed of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems followed by pointwise nonlinearities. These models combine the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the interpretability and inductive bias of dynamical systems, offering strong performance on long-sequence tasks with favorable computational complexity. However, their adoption in applications such as system identification and optimal control remains limited by the difficulty of enforcing stability and robustness in a principled and tractable manner. We introduce L2RU, a class of SSMs endowed with a prescribed $\\mathcal{L}_2$-gain bound, guaranteeing input--output stability and robustness for all parameter values. The L2RU architecture is derived from free parametrizations of LTI systems satisfying an $\\mathcal{L}_2$ constraint, enabling unconstrained optimization via standard gradient-based methods while preserving rigorous stability guarantees. Specifically, we develop two complementary parametrizations: a non-conservative formulation that provides a complete characterization of square LTI systems with a given $\\mathcal{L}_2$-bound, and a conservative formulation that extends the approach to general (possibly non-square) systems while improving computational efficiency through a structured representation of the system matrices. Both parametrizations admit efficient initialization schemes that facilitate training long-memory models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a nonlinear system identification benchmark, where L2RU achieves improved performance and training stability compared to existing SSM architectures, highlighting its potential as a principled and robust building block for learning and control.",

    "abstract": "Vector fields are advantageous in handling nonholonomic motion planning as they provide reference orientation for robots. However, additionally incorporating curvature constraints becomes challenging, due to the interconnection between the design of the curvature-bounded vector field and the tracking controller under underactuation. In this paper, we present a novel framework to co-develop the vector field and the control laws, guiding the nonholonomic robot to the target configuration with curvature-bounded trajectory. First, we formulate the problem by introducing the target positive limit set, which allows the robot to converge to or pass through the target configuration, depending on different dynamics and tasks. Next, we construct a curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) via blending and distributing basic flow fields in workspace and propose the saturated control laws with a dynamic gain, under which the tracking error's magnitude decreases even when saturation occurs. Under the control laws, kinematically constrained nonholonomic robots are guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive limit set with bounded trajectory curvature. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CVF method outperforms other vector-field-based algorithms. Experiments on Ackermann UGVs and semi-physical fixed-wing UAVs demonstrate that the method can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios.",

    "title": "A Cyber Insurance Policy for Hedging Against Load-Altering Attacks and Extreme Load Variations in Distribution Grids",
    "abstract": "Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE 118-bus test system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeder model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.",

More challenging problems remain underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs.

We introduce ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and present a deep learning framework for Bankart lesion detection on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI contains shoulder MRIs from patients who underwent arthroscopy, providing ground-truth labels from intraoperative findings, the diagnostic gold standard. Separate models were trained for MRIs and MRAs using CNN- and transformer-based architectures, with predictions ensembled across multiple imaging planes. Our models achieved radiologist-level performance, with accuracy on standard MRIs surpassing radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation on independent hospital data demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluation, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and foster development of datasets and models that address clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

    "abstract": "In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation",

Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.",

    "abstract": "Accurate tracking of underwater acoustic sources is critical for a variety of marine applications, yet remains a challenging task due to communication constraints and environmental uncertainties. In this regard, this paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking using a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The core idea is to optimize the guidance of each agent to achieve coordinated motion planning that leads to optimal geometric configurations with respect to the target, thereby enhancing tracking performance. To tackle this, we propose a Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) framework to improve performance and robustness. The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization task, incorporating geometric observability, proximity to the target, and communication connectivity. A Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach, coupled with an Unscented Transform (UT)-based prediction scheme, is employed to ensure longterm tracking accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. The optimization is distributed using the sequential multi-agent decision-making framework, combined with the Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communication protocol. The proposed methodology is implemented in a simulation environment that accounts for the constraints of acoustic communication. The approach is compared with existing methods such as decentralized MPC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).",

This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: this https URL .",

Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, a difficult task because nonlinear heat transfer and recurring daily cycles make historical data highly correlated and insufficient to generalize to new weather, occupancy, and control scenarios. This paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. Unlike traditional training approaches that minimize prediction errors, we employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) to learn the NN parameters with the objective of directly improving the HVAC cost performance. However, the discrete nature of MIQP hinders DFL, as it leads to undefined and discontinuous gradients, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. We leverage Stochastic Smoothing (SS) to enable efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional identify-then-optimize (i.e., the thermal dynamics model is identified on historical data then used in optimization) and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-aware building control.",

    "title": "How to Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap in Digital Twin-Aided Telecommunication Networks",
    "abstract": "Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.",

    "title": "Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction",
    "abstract": "Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain \"functional pathways\" in their attention heads.",

Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately.

    "abstract": "For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.",

While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are key enablers of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact channel features for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI and incur prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the near-field efficient feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate near-field CSI feedback with reduced overhead under diverse hardware constraints. NEFT builds on a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone with progressive token reduction and multi-scale feature extraction, enabling compact and effective modeling of near-field channel characteristics. Furthermore, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce model complexity while preserving accuracy; NEFT-Hybrid adopts an attention-free CNN encoder to reduce encoder-side computation; and NEFT-Edge combines NEFT-Hybrid with KD to enable deployment on highly resource-constrained edge devices. Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error over state-of-the-art methods, NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25-36% with negligible accuracy loss, while NEFT-Hybrid reduces encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.",

    "abstract": "While mel-spectrograms have been widely utilized as intermediate representations in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), their inherent redundancy leads to inefficiency in learning text-speech alignment. Compact VAE-based latent representations have recently emerged as a stronger alternative, but they also face a fundamental optimization dilemma: higher-dimensional latent spaces improve reconstruction quality and speaker similarity, but degrade intelligibility, while lower-dimensional spaces improve intelligibility at the expense of reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we propose Semantic-VAE, a novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization in the latent space. This design alleviates the reconstruction-generation trade-off by capturing semantic structure in high-dimensional latent representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-VAE significantly improves synthesis quality and training efficiency. When integrated into F5-TTS, our method achieves 2.10% WER and 0.64 speaker similarity on LibriSpeech-PC, outperforming mel-based systems (2.23%, 0.60) and vanilla acoustic VAE baselines (2.65%, 0.59).

First, we adapt the regularized policy gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and almost-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-based regularized policy gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL .",

The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization.

    "abstract": "This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic particle imaging reconstructs tracer distributions using a system matrix obtained through time-consuming, noise-prone calibration measurements. Methods for addressing imperfections in measured system matrices increasingly rely on deep neural networks, yet curated training data remain scarce. This study evaluates whether physics-based simulated system matrices can be used to train deep learning models for different system matrix restoration tasks, i.e., denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting, that generalize to measured data. A large system matrices dataset was generated using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, and includes background noise injected from empty-frame measurements. For each restoration task, deep learning models were compared with classical non-learning baseline methods. The models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: for denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations and led to perceptually better reconstuctions of real data; for 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at $\\times 2$-$\\times 4$ which did not transfer qualitatively to real measurements. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise, and for 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while a PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions. The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem and enables the development of new methods beyond current measurement capabilities.",

    "title": "Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Building Energy Management System",
    "abstract": "The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.",

It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.",

A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. The parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\\uı functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. So the unknowns of our LTDS can be computed by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.",

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.",

In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark.

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which extracts pulse waves from face videos captured by a camera, has the potential to enable convenient BP measurement without specialized medical devices.

In this paper, we propose U-FaceBP, an uncertainty-aware Bayesian ensemble deep learning method for face video-based BP measurement. U-FaceBP models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in face video-based BP estimation with a Bayesian neural network (BNN). Additionally, we design U-FaceBP as an ensemble method, estimating BP from rPPG signals, PPG signals derived from face videos, and face images using multiple BNNs. Large-scale experiments on two datasets involving 1197 subjects from diverse racial groups demonstrate that U-FaceBP outperforms state-of-the-art BP estimation methods. Furthermore, we show that the uncertainty estimates provided by U-FaceBP are informative and useful for guiding modality fusion, assessing prediction reliability, and analyzing performance across racial groups.",

However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.",

The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy.",

SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS.

In this work, we find that when a learning method is regularized with L2 weight decay, its learning signal will gradually align with the direction of the Hebbian learning signal as it approaches stationarity. This Hebbian-like behavior is not unique to SGD: almost any learning rule, including random ones, can exhibit the same signature long before learning has ceased. We also provide a theoretical explanation for anti-Hebbian plasticity in regression tasks, demonstrating how it can arise naturally from gradient or input noise, and offering a potential reason for the observed anti-Hebbian effects in the brain. Certainly, our proposed mechanisms do not rule out any conventionally established forms of Hebbian plasticity and could coexist with them extensively in the brain. A key insight for neurophysiology is the need to develop ways to experimentally distinguish these two types of Hebbian observations.",

In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.",

As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear optimization-based control policies, such as those those arising in nonlinear Model Predictive Control, have seen remarkable success in recent years. These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs online at each time-step. The resulting solution map, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the control policy is embedded in a gradient-based policy optimization scheme. We propose a principled way to regularize the nonlinear optimization problem, obtaining a surrogate derivative even if when the original problem is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.",

    "abstract": "Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that samples images by applying a neural network iteratively. However, the original sampling algorithm requires substantial computation cost, and reducing the sampling step is a prevailing research area. To cope with this problem, one mainstream approach is to treat the sampling process as an algorithm that solves an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our study proposes a training-free inference plugin compatible with most few-step ODE solvers. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first training-free algorithm to sample a 1024 x 1024-resolution image in 6 steps and a 512 x 512-resolution image in 5 steps, with an FID result that outperforms the SOTA distillation models and the 20-step DPM++ 2m solver, respectively. Based on analyses of the latent diffusion model's structure, the diffusion ODE, and the Free-U mechanism, we explain why specific hyperparameter couplings improve stability and inference speed without retraining. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal a new design space of the latent diffusion ODE solver. Additionally, we also analyze the difference between the original diffusion model and the diffusion distillation model via an information-theoretic study, which shows the reason why the few-step ODE solver designed for the diffusion model can outperform the training-based diffusion distillation algorithm in few-step inference. The tentative results of the experiment prove the mathematical analysis. code base is below: this https URL",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and the preparation of an AI-ready engineering workforce. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards, talent development initiatives, and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also oriented toward human and societal benefit.",

The algorithm is composed of two interacting modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The algorithm enjoys sublinear \\textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\\boldsymbol{g}$, where $\\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain with $20\\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.

In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.",

However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.",

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.",

In safety-critical settings, this is brittle: easy and ambiguous inputs receive identical processing, and uncertainty is only read off retrospectively from raw probabilities. We introduce the Surgical Cognitive Interpreter (SCI), a lightweight closed-loop metacognitive control layer that wraps an existing stochastic model and turns prediction into an iterative process. SCI monitors a scalar interpretive state SP(t), here instantiated as a normalized entropy-based confidence signal, and adaptively decides whether to stop, continue sampling, or abstain. The goal is not to improve accuracy per se, but to regulate interpretive error {\\Delta}SP and expose a safety signal that tracks when the underlying model is likely to fail. We instantiate SCI around Monte Carlo dropout classifiers in three domains: vision (MNIST digits), medical time series (MIT-BIH arrhythmia), and industrial condition monitoring (rolling-element bearings). In all cases, the controller allocates more inference steps to misclassified inputs than to correct ones (up to about 3-4x on MNIST and bearings, and 1.4x on MIT-BIH). The resulting {\\Delta}SP acts as a usable safety signal for detecting misclassifications (AUROC 0.63 on MNIST, 0.70 on MIT-BIH, 0.86 on bearings). Code and reproducibility: this https URL",

    "abstract": "The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel framework for estimating industrial heterogeneity by integrating maximum entropy (ME) estimation of production functions with Zonotope-based measures. Traditional production function estimations often rely on restrictive parametric models, failing to capture firm behavior under uncertainty. This research addresses these limitations by applying Hang K. Ryu's ME method to estimate production functions using World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) data from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, and India. The study normalizes entropy values to quantify heterogeneity and compares these measures with a Zonotope-based Gini index. Results demonstrate the ME method's superiority in capturing nuanced, functional heterogeneity often missed by traditional techniques. Furthermore, the study incorporates a \"Tangent Against Input Axes\" method to dynamically assess technical change within industries. By integrating information theory with production economics, this unified framework quantifies structural and functional differences across industries using firm-level data, advancing both methodological and empirical understanding of heterogeneity. A numerical simulation confirms the ME regression functions can approximate actual industrial heterogeneity. The research also highlights the superior ability of the ME method to provide a precise and economically meaningful measure of industry heterogeneity, particularly for longitudinal analyses.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how the layout and seat density in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure in order to select numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the extent to which groups with elevated mortality rates ex ante might opt out of guaranteed national pensions in favour of demographically aligned plans, which we label equitable longevity risk sharing (ELRiS) pools, even if this involves accepting some idiosyncratic risk. Technically, this paper develops a stochastic model of retirement income within an ELRiS structure that is calibrated to equate the discounted expected utility of a guaranteed national pension. The practical motivation for developing this alternative is that working members of First Nations peoples of Canada: (1) experience much higher mortality rates than average over their entire life cycle, and (2) some are actually allowed by current legislation to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). We then demonstrate that under reasonable economic preferences and parameters, a sub-group with a 10-year life expectancy gap relative to the population could attain equivalent lifetime utility by contributing a mere two-thirds to the plan, even if they were pooled with only 30 members. For a longevity gap of 20 years, such as between an Indigenous male versus a non-Indigenous female, the contribution rate falls to less than a third. The difference between the statutory and mandatory contribution rates to a guaranteed national pension and those needed within these self-sustaining pools is an implicit subsidy from Indigenous to non-Indigenous. From a policy perspective, this paper aspires to jump-start a conversation that sparks a change in a status quo, which is obviously unfair and inequitable.",

By employing a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, we model an alternative strategy that prioritizes the early acquisition of high-quality information assets. We simulate the entire upstream value chain-comprising competitive bidding, exploration, and development phases-to evaluate the economic impact of this approach relative to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate that front-loading information investment significantly reduces the costs associated with redundant data acquisition and enhances the precision of reserve valuation. Specifically, we find that the alternative strategy outperforms traditional methods in highly competitive environments by mitigating the \"winner's curse\" through more accurate bidding. Furthermore, the economic benefits are most pronounced during the development phase, where superior data quality minimizes capital misallocation. These findings suggest that optimal investment timing is structurally dependent on market competition rather than solely on price volatility, offering a new paradigm for capital allocation in extractive industries.",

Facing a larger class of problems compared to the usual analysis in the literature, i.e., replacing the assumption of normal with sub-Gaussian errors, I prove that both methods ensure model selection consistency and oracle efficiency even when the number of instruments and covariates exceeds the sample size. For BRIDGE, I also prove that if the former is growing but slower than the latter, the same properties hold even without sub-Gaussian errors. When p is greater than n, BRIDGE requires a slightly weaker set of assumptions to have the desirable properties, as adaptive LASSO requires a good initial estimator of the relevant weights. However, adaptive LASSO is expected to be much faster computationally, so the methods are competitive on different fronts and the one that is recommended depends on the researcher's resources.",

Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used to nowcast quarterly GDP growth, but adoption in high-stakes settings requires that predictive accuracy be matched by interpretability and robust uncertainty quantification. This article reviews recent developments in macroeconomic nowcasting and compares econometric benchmarks with ML approaches in data-rich and shock-prone environments, emphasizing the use of nowcasts as decision inputs rather than as mere error-minimization exercises. The discussion is organized along three axes. First, we contrast penalized regressions, dimension-reduction techniques, tree ensembles, and neural networks with autoregressive models, Dynamic Factor Models, and Random Walks, emphasizing how each family handles small samples, collinearity, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts. Second, we examine explainability tools (intrinsic measures and model-agnostic XAI methods), focusing on temporal stability, sign coherence, and their ability to sustain credible economic narratives and nowcast revisions. Third, we analyze non-parametric uncertainty quantification via block bootstrapping for predictive intervals and confidence bands on feature importance under serial dependence and ragged edge. We translate these elements into a reference workflow for \"decision-grade\" nowcasting systems, including vintage management, time-aware validation, and automated reliability audits, and we outline a research agenda on regime-dependent model comparison, bootstrap design for latent components, and temporal stability of explanations.

    "abstract": "Nonparametric regression estimators, including those employed in regression-discontinuity designs (RDD), are central to the economist's toolbox. Their application, however, is complicated by the presence of asymptotic bias, which undermines coverage accuracy of conventional confidence intervals. Extant solutions to the problem include debiasing methods, such as the widely applied robust bias-corrected (RBC) confidence interval of Calonico et al. (2014, 2018). We show that this interval is equivalent to a prepivoted interval based on an invalid residual-based bootstrap method. Specifically, prepivoting performs an implicit bias correction while adjusting the nonparametric regression estimator's standard error to account for the additional uncertainty introduced by debiasing. This idea can also be applied to other bootstrap schemes, leading to new implicit bias corrections and corresponding standard error adjustments. We propose a prepivoted interval based on a bootstrap that generates observations from nonparametric regression estimates at each regressor value and show how it can be implemented as an RBC-type interval without the need for resampling. Importantly, we show that the new interval is shorter than the existing RBC interval. For example, with the Epanechnikov kernel, the length is reduced by 17%, while maintaining accurate coverage probability. This result holds irrespectively of: (a) the evaluation point being in the interior or on the boundary; (b) the use of a 'small' or 'large' bandwidths; (c) the distribution of the regressor and the error term.",

    "title": "Nepal Engagement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) A Philosophical and Economic Perspective",
    "abstract": "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), started in 2004 by the United States Congress, focuses on development initiatives involving good governance, sustainable economic growth, and poverty reduction. Since its inception, it has invested over 13 billion US dollars in 30 countries. Nepal is a recent beneficiary, signing a compact valued at 500 million US dollars in 2017, ratified in 2022. The compact mainly invests in road infrastructure and electricity transmission, including construction of 315 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines, three substations, and upgrading 100 kilometers of the East-West highway. By supporting commercialization of Nepals 40 gigawatt hydropower potential, the MCC aims to enhance Nepals structural economic prosperity. Beyond economics, the compact influences Nepals foreign policy by diversifying partnerships and reducing overdependence on neighbors China and India. The establishment of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)-Nepal fosters host-country ownership, mitigating geopolitical concerns. Building on International Relations scholar Shiping Tangs Institutional Foundations for Economic Development (IFED) framework, this paper shows how the MCC addresses Nepals infrastructure development capacity. Success stories from Ghana and other MCC countries highlight transformative progress toward prosperity, positioning Nepal to leverage both development and diplomatic opportunities. Drawing from multiple sources, this paper argues that the MCC compact provides Nepal with opportunities to overcome infrastructural barriers to growth.",

    "title": "Orchestrating Rewards in the Era of Intelligence-Driven Commerce",
    "abstract": "Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.",

In the study, the k-means clustering technique is used. The optimum number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method in combination with the Silhouette Index. Moreover, all results are visualized to enhance comprehensibility. The results show that countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, and Denmark are in the high energy trilemma group with index scores of 82.2, 82.3, 82.7, and 83.3, respectively. Countries in the high group have achieved a high level of balance between energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Australia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia are in the medium energy trilemma group with index scores of 76.4, 76.6, 77.1, 77.6, and 78.7, respectively. Countries in the medium group have made progress in balancing the dimensions of the energy trilemma but have not yet reached excellence. However, countries such as Mexico, Türkiye, Colombia, and Costa Rica are in the low energy trilemma group with index scores of 63.1, 64.1, 64.8, and 69.3, respectively. These low energy trilemma group countries face significant challenges in balancing energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability and need to make improvements in these areas.",

Using this measure, I show that public polarization has been increasing for the past three decades and that these changes are mostly due to increases in general disagreement, not dimensional collapse. Furthermore, these increases are not explained by the diverging opinions of Democrats and Republicans, nor divergence of opinions across gender, geography, education, or any other demographic divide.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital commerce platforms has amplified the strategic importance of coordinated pricing and inventory management decisions among competing retailers. Motivated by practices on leading e-commerce platforms, we analyze a sequential duopolistic newsvendor game where retailers first publicly set prices and subsequently make private inventory decisions under demand uncertainty. Our theory predicts that higher profit margins and demand uncertainty intensify price competition, while optimal inventory responses to demand uncertainty are shaped by profit margins. Laboratory evidence, however, reveals that participants are generally reluctant to compete on price, frequently coordinating on salient focal (reserve) prices, particularly in low-margin settings, and show little sensitivity to demand uncertainty in pricing. On the inventory side, participants' order quantities are largely insensitive to chosen prices and continue to exhibit well-documented Pull-to-Center biases. These findings reveal a disconnect between pricing and inventory decisions under competition and highlight the importance of accounting for persistent behavioral tendencies in retail operations.",

    "abstract": "We study misspecified Bayesian learning in principal-agent relationships, where an agent is assessed by an evaluator and rewarded by the market. The agent's outcome depends on their innate ability, costly effort -- whose effectiveness is governed by a productivity parameter -- and noise. The market infers the agent's ability from observed outcomes and rewards them accordingly. The evaluator conducts costly assessments to reduce outcome noise, which shape the market's inferences and provide implicit incentives for effort. Society -- including the evaluator and the market -- holds dogmatic, inaccurate beliefs about ability, which distort learning about effort productivity and effort choice. This, in turn, shapes the evaluator's choice of assessment. We describe a feedback loop linking misspecified ability, biased learning about effort, and distorted assessment. We characterize outcomes that arise in stable steady states and analyze their robust comparative statics and learning foundations. Applications to education and labor market reveal how stereotypes can reinforce across domains -- sometimes disguised as narrowing or even reversals of outcome gaps -- and how policy interventions targeting assessment can help.",

Using the identification strategy of Ottonello and Song (2022), which isolates high-frequency surprises to banks' credit supply capacity, we show that positive shocks appreciate local currencies, lower external borrowing costs, increase capital flows to domestic banking sectors, and raise investment, credit, and real activity across EMEs. These effects are highly robust across specifications and samples. Using administrative credit-registry data from Uruguay, we find that better capitalized banks transmit global credit easing more strongly. At the firm level, responses are weaker for more leveraged firms, especially those with foreign-currency debt, short maturities, or collateral not priced to market.",

    "abstract": "Australian house prices have risen strongly since the mid-1990s, but growth has been highly uneven across regions. Raw growth figures obscure whether these differences reflect persistent structural trends or cyclical fluctuations. We address this by estimating a three-factor model in levels for regional repeat-sales log price indexes over 1995-2024. The model decomposes each regional index into a national Market factor, two stationary spreads (Mining and Lifestyle) that capture mean-reverting geographic cycles, and a city-specific residual. The Mining spread, proxied by a Perth-Sydney index differential, reflects resource-driven oscillations in relative performance; the Lifestyle spread captures amenity-driven coastal and regional cycles. The Market loading isolates each region's fundamental sensitivity, beta, to national growth, so that a city's growth under an assumed national change is calculated from its beta once mean-reverting spreads are netted out. Comparing realised paths to these factor-implied trajectories indicates when a city is historically elevated or depressed, and attributes the gap to Mining or Lifestyle spreads. Expanding-window ARIMAX estimation reveals that Market betas are stable across major shocks (the mining boom, the Global Financial Crisis, and COVID-19), while Mining and Lifestyle behave as stationary spreads that widen forecast funnels without overturning the cross-sectional ranking implied by beta. Melbourne amplifies national growth, Sydney tracks the national trend closely, and regional areas dampen it. The framework thus provides a simple, factor-based tool for interpreting regional growth differentials and their persistence.",

We compile a novel dataset covering the enactment of cybercrime legislation in 132 developed and developing countries to empirically test this research question. We find that the enactment of cybercrime laws enhances the stability of the banking sector. This key finding holds across a comprehensive suite of robustness tests, including alternative measures of bank stability and model specifications. We document significant cross-sectional heterogeneity, with the effect being more pronounced in countries with heavier penalties for illegal cyber activities and legal frameworks that hold banks accountable for their cybersecurity practices. In addition, the positive impact is stronger in jurisdictions with greater international legal cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms. We further investigate two channels (i.e., funding liquidity and operational risk) through which cybercrime laws may influence bank stability. Our results indicate that these laws can significantly bolster bank stability by enhancing funding liquidity and mitigating operational risk. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of cybercrime legislation in fostering a secure and resilient banking environment. It offers new insights into how these laws contribute to bank stability on both individual and systemic levels.",

This sequential structure, often referred to as \"virtual observability,\" suggests that timing alone can shape expectations and choices, even when no information is revealed. The original notion of virtual observability, however, is an equilibrium refinement based on the timing structure and has no bite in games with a unique equilibrium. In this paper, we experimentally examine whether timing still affects behavior in such games, using the Traveler's Dilemma and the Trust Game. We find that in the sequential Traveler's Dilemma without observability, first movers tend to behave closer to the equilibrium prediction than in the simultaneous version. In contrast, timing without observability has no effect on behavior in the Trust Game.",

A sustainable annual GDP growth rate of 7 to 8 percent is projected as necessary to achieve this milestone while maintaining fiscal prudence through a targeted deficit threshold below 3.5 percent of GDP. The study underscores the role of disciplined fiscal management in financing critical public investments in infrastructure, human capital development and technological innovation. Given constraints on domestic resource mobilization, the paper highlights the importance of multilateral financial institutions, including the World Bank, IMF and ADB, in expanding fiscal space in India through concessional financing, technical cooperation, and risk sharing mechanisms. Using econometric modeling and scenario analysis, the research identifies key policy interventions in infrastructure, healthcare, education and sustainable energy that can maximize growth while ensuring fiscal sustainability. Policy recommendations include enhancing tax buoyancy, rationalizing expenditure, optimizing public private partnerships and strengthening fiscal responsibility frameworks. The findings suggest that a calibrated approach to growth, prudent fiscal management and strategic international collaborations are critical to achieving long term economic aspirations of India.",

    "abstract": "The empirical literature that covers Phillips Curve analysis during recessionary periods is notably scant. The Great Recession has rekindled a debate on the validity and stability of the Phillips Curve which is still ongoing. The basis for this debate is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without causing a drop in inflation. This paper carries out an empirical analysis for the classical expectation-augmented Phillips curve model across 41 countries from1980-2016 by distinguishing tranquil and recessionary periods separately. Based on the results of the research, the paper finds that dynamics of Phillips Curve changes during recessionary periods and the empirical relationship becomes no longer valid. These findings support the ongoing debate about the missing disinflation and collapse of the Phillips curve, but only during the recessionary periods. In the case of tranquil periods, the empirical relationship still seems to be valid. Moreover, the paper also observes that both backward-looking and forward-looking fractions of inflation gain weight and significance during recessionary periods. However, the paper remains indecisive about which exact fraction gains more weight and significance as the panel model does not incorporate these two fractions of inflation in a single hybrid framework simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Time series prediction algorithms are increasingly central to decision-making in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, energy management, and economic planning. Yet, these systems often inherit and amplify biases embedded in historical data, flawed problem specifications, and socio-technical design decisions. This paper critically examines the ethical foundations and mitigation strategies for algorithmic bias in time series prediction. We outline how predictive models, particularly in temporally dynamic domains, can reproduce structural inequalities and emergent discrimination through proxy variables and feedback loops. The paper advances a threefold contribution: First, it reframes algorithmic bias as a socio- technical phenomenon rooted in normative choices and institutional constraints. Second, it offers a structured diagnosis of bias sources across the pipeline, emphasizing the need for causal modeling, interpretable systems, and inclusive design practices. Third, it advocates for structural reforms that embed fairness through participatory governance, stakeholder engagement, and legally enforceable safeguards. Special attention is given to fairness validation in dynamic environments, proposing multi-metric, temporally-aware, and context- sensitive evaluation methods. Ultimately, we call for an integrated ethics-by-design approach that positions fairness not as a trade-off against performance, but as a co-requisite of responsible innovation. This framework is essential to developing predictive systems that are not only effective and adaptive but also aligned with democratic values and social equity.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.",

This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model. We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.",

On the one hand, such quarrels are politically significant because they incentivize players to strategically join coalitions in order to sabotage them from within; on the other, a postulate based on them cannot provide a reasonable normative criterion for evaluating measures of voting power. We therefore formalize a general framework of quarrels -- comprising twelve conceptions distinguished according to symmetry, reciprocality, and strength -- and provide criteria for whether a conception provides a suitable basis for a reasonable quarrel postulate. Although the two existing conceptions, proposed by Felsenthal and Machover and by Laruelle and Valenciano, do not, our framework's symmetric, weak conception does.",

Continuous treatments present more significant challenges than discrete ones because population welfare may need nonparametric estimation, and policy space may be infinite-dimensional and may satisfy shape restrictions. We propose to approximate the policy space with a sequence of finite-dimensional spaces and, for any given policy, obtain the empirical welfare by applying the kernel method. We consider two cases: known and unknown propensity scores. In the latter case, we allow for machine learning of the propensity score and modify the empirical welfare to account for the effect of machine learning. The learned policy maximizes the empirical welfare or the modified empirical welfare over the approximating space. In both cases, we modify the penalty algorithm proposed in Mbakop and Tabord-Meehan (2021) to data-automate the tuning parameters (i.e., bandwidth and dimension of the approximating space) and establish an oracle inequality for the welfare regret.",

Each menu contained two, three and four lotteries with three monetary outcomes, and was shown five times. Subjects could avoid/defer making active choices at a positive expected cost. Among our 308 subjects from the UK and Germany, significantly more were compatible with ordinal and expected utility maximization in their last 15 than in their first 15 identical decision problems. Around a quarter and a fifth of all subjects, moreover, were compatible with those modes *throughout* the experiment, with nearly half of these under weak preferences. Choice consistency is positively correlated with cognitive ability, and subjects who converged to utility-maximizing behaviour were more cognitively able than those who did not. We discuss potential implications of our study's novel set of findings.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the OECD's global minimum tax (GMT) in a formal model of tax competition between asymmetric countries. We consider both profit shifting and real responses of multinational enterprises, and highlight the role of the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE) in investment incentives and tax rate setting. The GMT reduces the true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the revenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run where tax rates are fixed, the GMT reduces the small country's revenue if profit shifting costs are low and increases it otherwise. In the long run where countries adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition pattern. We reveal that the minimum rate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate, countries will set tax rates below the minimum to boost capital investments and collect top-up taxes. Simulations show that a moderate GMT rate can raise both countries' revenues and the large country's welfare in the long run. However, it may reduce the small country's welfare if the welfare weight of private income is high.",

    "abstract": "We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without relying on new taxation or the creation of new jobs. In a Solow-Zeira task-automation economy with a CES aggregator $\\sigma < 1$, we introduce an AI capability parameter that scales the productivity of automatable tasks and obtain a tractable expression for the AI capability threshold -- the minimum productivity of AI relative to pre-AI automation required for a balanced transfer. Using current U.S. economic parameters, we find that even in the conservative scenario where no new tasks or jobs emerge, AI systems would only need to reach only 5-7 times today's automation productivity to fund an 11%-of-GDP UBI. Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automation productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it. These results therefore offer a rigorous benchmark for assessing when advancing AI capabilities might sustainably finance social transfers in an increasingly automated economy.",

In the model, called Entropy Regularized Belief Reporting (ERBR), the agent is endowed with a latent benchmark prior that is unobserved by the analyst. When presented with a partition, the agent reports a prior that minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence from the latent benchmark prior subject to entropy regularization. This captures the intuition that while the agent would like to report a prior that is close to her latent benchmark prior, she may also have a preference to remain noncommittal. I provide the structural properties of the model that allow for identification of the latent benchmark prior and apply the model to the experimental data from Benjamin et al. (2017).",

Agents not only choose the precision of their signals and what dimension of the state to learn about, but these decisions directly determine the underlying network structure on which social learning occurs. We show that under a fixed network structure, the optimal precision choice is sublinear in the agent's stationary influence in the network, and this individually optimal choice is worse than the socially optimal choice by a factor of $n^{1/3}$. Under a dynamic network structure, we specify the network by defining a kernel distance between agents, which then determines how much weight agents place on one another. Agents choose dimensions to learn about such that their choice minimizes the squared sum of influences of all agents: a network with equally distributed influence across agents is ideal.",

We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral alignment by employing large language models to compile 373,020 geopolitical events across 193 countries from 1960 to 2024. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise timing and magnitude of geopolitical shifts. Exploiting within-country temporal variation with local projections, we find that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per capita by 10 percent over 20 years. These growth effects operate through multiple reinforcing channels, including domestic stability, investment, trade, and productivity. Over the sample period, geopolitical factors account for GDP variations ranging from -30 to +30 percent across countries.",

    "abstract": "Collusion and capacity withholding in electricity wholesale markets are important mechanisms of market manipulation. This study applies a refined machine learning-based cartel detection algorithm to two cartel cases in the Italian electricity market and evaluates its out-of-sample performance. Specifically, we consider an ensemble machine learning method that uses statistical screens constructed from the offer price distribution as predictors for the incidence of collusion among electricity providers in specific regions. We propose novel screens related to the capacity-withholding behavior of electricity providers and find that including such screens derived from the day-ahead spot market as predictors can improve cartel detection. We find that, under complete cartels - where collusion in a tender presumably involves all suppliers - the method correctly classifies up to roughly 95% of tenders in our data as collusive or competitive, improving classification accuracy compared to using only previously available screens. However, when trained on larger datasets including non-cartel members and applying algorithms tailored to detect incomplete cartels, the previously existing screens are sufficient to achieve 98% accuracy, and the addition of our newly proposed capacity-withholding screens does not further improve performance. Overall, this study highlights the promising potential of supervised machine learning techniques for detecting and dismantling cartels in electricity markets.",

We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM), where transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate supply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main properties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash equilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis extends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds and exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is shaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized negotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby call into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled via the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information limitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus offers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical general equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal consistency within a unified framework.",

I characterize optimal policies using a decomposition of the dynamic problem into optimal stopping and static information acquisition. Eventually, information acquisition either stops or follows a simple cycle in which updates occur at regular intervals to restore prescribed levels of relative certainty. This enables precise analysis of long run dynamics across environments. As fixed costs of information vanish, belief changes become lumpy: it is optimal to either wait or acquire information so as to exactly confirm the current belief until rare news prompts a sudden change. The long run solution admits a closed-form characterization in terms of the \"virtual flow payoff\". I highlight an illustrative application to portfolio diversification.",

Our derivations are obtained under a natural and general form of cross-unit interference, which we call \"local interference\".

To address both issues simultaneously, we propose a Bayesian SCM that integrates a soft simplex constraint within spike-and-slab variable selection. The hierarchical prior structure captures the extent to which the data supports the simplex constraint, allowing for more efficient and data-adaptive counterfactual estimation. The intractable marginal likelihood induced by the soft simplex constraint presents a major computational challenge, which we resolve by developing a novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that updates the regression coefficients of two predictors simultaneously. Our main theoretical contribution is a high-dimensional selection consistency result for the spike-and-slab variable selection under the simplex constraint, which significantly extends the current theory for high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method performs well across diverse settings. To illustrate its practical values, we apply it to two empirical examples for estimating the effect of economic policies.",
