    "abstract": "Black hole environments often host plasmas that are fully collisionless or contain intrinsically collisionless regions, including relativistic jets and coronae where particle energization is ubiquitous. Capturing the physics of these systems requires numerical methods capable of modeling relativistic, magnetized, collisionless plasmas in strong gravitational fields. In this work, we introduce the general-relativistic module for the Entity -- the first open-source, coordinate-agnostic performance-portable particle-in-cell code. The code enables fast axisymmetric simulations of collisionless plasmas around black holes on any modern high-performance computing architecture (both GPUs and CPUs).",

    "title": "Detecting the signature of helium reionization through 3HeII 3.46cm line-intensity mapping",
    "abstract": "Helium reionization is the most recent phase change of the intergalactic medium, yet its timing and main drivers remain uncertain. Among the probes to trace its unfolding, the 3.46 cm hyperfine line of singly-ionized helium opens the study of helium reionization to upcoming radio surveys. We aim to evaluate the detectability of the 3.46,cm signal with radio surveys and the possible constraints it can place on helium reionization, in particular whether it can distinguish between early and late helium reionization scenarios. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive study of the advantages of single-dish vs. interferometric setup. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we construct mock data cubes for two models of helium reionization. We compute the power spectrum of the signal and forecast the signal-to-noise ratio for SKA-1 MID, DSA-2000, and a PUMA-like survey, in both observational setups. The two scenarios produce distinct power spectra, but the faintness of the signal, largely caused by weak coupling between the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature in low-density regions of the IGM, combined with high instrumental noise, makes detection very difficult within realistic integration times for current surveys. A PUMA-like survey operating in single-dish mode could, however, detect the 3.46 cm signal with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of a few in < 1000 h in both scenarios. Distinguishing helium reionization scenarios with 3.46 cm line-intensity mapping therefore remains challenging for current facilities. Our results, however, indicate that next-generation, high-sensitivity surveys with optimized observing strategies, especially when combined with complementary probes of the IGM, could begin to place meaningful constraints on the timing and morphology of helium reionization.",

    "abstract": "Primordial dark matter halos are well understood from cold dark matter-only simulations. Since they can contract significantly as baryons settle into their centers, direct comparisons with observed galaxies are complicated. We present an approach to reversing the halo contraction by numerically calculating the halo response to baryonic infall and iterating the initial condition. This allowed us to derive spherically averaged primordial dark matter halos for observed galaxies. We applied this approach to the Milky Way and found that the latest Gaia measurements for the rotation velocities imply an odd primordial Galactic halo: Its concentration and total mass differ by more than 3$\\sigma$ from the predictions, and the density profile presents an inner core that is too shallow and an outer decline that is too steep to be compatible with the cold dark matter paradigm.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging",
    "abstract": "Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in astronomy. VLBI measures corrupted Fourier components, known as visibilities. Reconstructing on-sky images from these visibilities is a challenging inverse problem, particularly for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), where incomplete sampling and severe calibration errors introduce significant uncertainty in the image. To help guide convergence and control the uncertainty in image reconstructions, regularization on the space of images is utilized, such as enforcing smoothness or similarity to a fiducial image. Coupled with this regularization is the introduction of a new set of parameters that modulate its strength. We present a hierarchical Bayesian imaging approach (Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging, HIBI) that enables the quantification of uncertainty for al parameters. Incorporating instrumental effects within HIBI is straightforward, allowing for simultaneous imaging and calibration of data. To showcase HIBI's effectiveness and flexibility, we build a simple imaging model based on Markov random fields and demonstrate how different physical components can be included, e.g., black hole shadow size, and their uncertainties can be inferred. For example, while the original EHT publications were unable to constrain the ring width of M87*, HIBI measures a width of $9.3\\pm 1.3\\,\\mu{\\rm as}$. We apply HIBI to image and calibrate EHT synthetic data, real EHT observations of M87*, and multifrequency observations of \\oj287. Across these tests, HIBI accurately recovers a wide variety of image structures and quantifies their uncertainties. HIBI is publicly available in the this http URL VLBI software repository.",

In this study, we examine Kepler-1624b, a sub-Saturn orbiting an M dwarf that was previously found to exhibit transit timing variations with an amplitude of approximately 2 minutes, suggesting the presence of a nearby non-transiting companion. We reanalyze the transits from archival Kepler data and extend the TTV baseline by 11 years by combining TESS data with three new ground-based transit observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatories. We jointly fit these datasets and find that the TTV amplitude is significantly weaker in our updated analysis. We calculate the Bayes factor for a one-planet versus two-planet model and find that the one-planet model is preferred. Our results highlight the need for careful analysis of systems with relatively low amplitude TTV signals that are identified in large automated catalogs.",

    "abstract": "Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models. We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary. The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between the composition of rocky exoplanets and their host stars is fundamental to understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$\\sigma$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\\sim15\\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.",

    "abstract": "Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for studying the fundamental properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. Detailed analyses of galaxy-scale lenses have revealed localized gravitational perturbations beyond the smooth mass distribution of the main lens galaxy, largely attributed to dark matter subhalos and intervening line-of-sight halos. Recent studies suggest that, in contrast to subhalos, line-of-sight halos imprint distinct anisotropic features on the two-point correlation function of the effective lensing deflection field. These anisotropies are particularly sensitive to the collisional nature of dark matter, offering a potential means to test alternatives to the cold dark matter paradigm. In this study, we explore whether a neural density estimator can directly identify such anisotropic signatures from galaxy-galaxy strong lens images. We model the multipoles of the two-point function using a power-law parameterization and train a neural density estimator to predict the corresponding posterior distribution of lensing parameters, alongside parameter distributions for dark matter substructure. Our results show that recovering the dark matter substructure mass functions and mass-concentration parameters remains challenging, owing to difficulties in generating uniform training data set while using physically motivated priors. We also unveil an important degeneracy between the line-of-sight halo mass-function amplitude and the subhalo mass-function normalization. Furthermore, the network exhibits limited accuracy in predicting the two-point function multipole parameters, suggesting that both the training data and the adopted power-law fitting function may inadequately represent the true underlying structure of the anisotropic signal.",

In addition to our H{\\alpha} images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.",

    "abstract": "There is clear observational evidence that the main Class 0/I stages of the star formation process are associated with powerful collimated outflows (jets), which sometimes propagate up to distances as large as $10^{4-5}$ au scales in molecular clouds. Additionally, intermediate high-mass and low-mass protostars have often been observed to form in crowded clusters, where the typical separation distance between any two cluster members is of the same order or smaller than the scale of the outflow length. Therefore, there must be an interaction between the molecular outflows of different protostars within the protostellar association. A good example of this is the case of Cepheus E-mm, which is a protostellar outflow extending over a few dozen au. At its core is a binary system consisting of two protostars, Cep E-A and Cep E-B, separated by about 1000 au. Both protostars eject molecular jets at velocities of ~100 km/s. The interaction between these molecular outflows provides an opportunity to study the effects of jet collisions in a clustered star-forming environment, as they may leave detectable imprints on the morphology of the main envelope of the system. Our work aims to study the effects of the collision of molecular jets associated with the components of the binary system Cep-A and Cep-E, analyzing the disruption or reduction of molecular emission in the main envelope of the system, which the molecular outflow { launched} by Cep-A presumably pushes. If we characterize the collision in this system, we can provide insights into the expected morphology and molecular emissions in collisions of molecular outflows { associated to star forming process.",

The operation of these toolkits is described alongside the overall functionality of the SP pipeline. Qualification of the pipeline confirmed that it is ready to process all the HTRU-North data. Additionally, the survey's sensitivity to SPs, the impact of RFI thereon, the performance of the deep-learning classifier FETCH, and some insights that may be used to improve the pipeline's performance in the future are determined.

The source was initially speculated to be a white dwarf (WD) pulsar system due to its short period ($P\\sim12$ min) and highly-modulated optical lightcurves. Our observations revealed a variable X-ray counterpart extending up to 40 keV with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X \\sim 3\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3--40 keV). Utilizing timing data from XMM and NICER, we detected a periodic signal at $P_{\\rm spin}=12.2640(7)\\pm0.0583$ min with $>6\\sigma$ significance. The pulsed profile displays $\\sim 25\\%$ and $\\sim10\\%$ modulation in the 0.3--2 and 2--10 keV bands, respectively. Broadband X-ray spectra are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin thermal plasma model with $kT \\approx 25$ keV and a Fe K-$\\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV. The bright and hard X-ray emission rules out the possibility of a WD pulsar or ultra-compact X-ray binary. The high plasma temperature and Fe emission lines suggest that ZTF J1851 is an intermediate polar spinning at 12.264 min. We employed an X-ray spectral model composed of the accretion column emission and X-ray reflection to fit the broadband X-ray spectra. Assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and the inner accretion disk, we derived a WD mass range of $M_{\\rm WD}=(1.07\\rm{-}1.32)M_{\\odot}$ exceeding the mean WD mass of IPs ($\\langle M_{\\rm WD} \\rangle = 0.8 M_\\odot)$.

    "title": "An Overabundance of Radio-AGN in the SPT2349-56 Protocluster: Preheating the Intra-Cluster Medium",
    "abstract": "Following the detection of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56, we have obtained additional observations with MeerKAT in S-band (2.4 GHz) with the aim of further characterizing radio emission from amongst the ~30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We newly identify three of the protocluster SMGs individually at 2.4GHz as having a radio-excess, two of which are now known to be X-ray luminous AGN. Two additional members are also detected with radio emission consistent with their star formation rate (SFR). Archival MeerKAT UHF (816 MHz) observations further constrain luminosities and radio spectral indices of these five galaxies. The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is used to detect and resolve the central two sources at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz finding elongated, jet-like morphologies. The excess radio luminosities range from L1.4,rest = (1-20)x10^25 W/Hz, ~10-100x higher than expected from the SFRs, assuming the usual far-infrared-radio correlation. Of the known cluster members, only the SMG `N1' shows signs of AGN in any other diagnostics, namely a large and compact excess in CO(11-10) line emission. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs. The overdensity of radio-loud AGN in the compact core region of the cluster may be providing significant heating to the recently discovered nascent intra-cluster medium (ICM) in SPT2349-56.",

    "abstract": "TIC 322208686 is known to be a detached binary that exhibits two types of variability: pulsation and eclipse. We present the physical properties of the target star using the short-cadence TESS data from sectors 24, 57, and 58, and our echelle spectra that show the presence of a tertiary companion. The spectral analysis led to the triple-lined radial velocities and the atmospheric parameters of the eclipsing components. Joint modeling of these observations reveals that the eclipsing pair contains two F-type stars with masses $1.564\\pm0.012$ $M_\\odot$ and $1.483\\pm0.012$ $M_\\odot$, radii $1.588\\pm0.011$ $R_\\odot$ and $1.500\\pm0.012$ $R_\\odot$, effective temperatures $7028\\pm100$ K and $7020\\pm110$ K, and luminosities $5.51\\pm0.32$ $L_\\odot$ and $4.90\\pm0.32$ $L_\\odot$. The light contributions of the three stars obtained from this modeling match well with those calculated from the observed spectra. The binary star parameters are in satisfactory agreement with evolutionary model predictions for age $t$ = 0.4 Gyr and metallicity $Z$ = 0.03. We extracted 11 significant frequencies from the TESS light residuals with the binary effects removed. Of these, five signals between 0.65 day$^{-1}$ and 1.89 day$^{-1}$ can be considered as $\\gamma$ Dor pulsations originating mainly from the primary component, while the other frequencies are likely instrumental artifacts or combination terms. These results suggest that TIC 322208686 is a hierarchical triple, containing a pulsating eclipsing pair and a tertiary companion.",

    "abstract": "It is usually assumed that mutual synchronisation of a tidal two-body system happens through tidal recession, assuming the reduced Hill sphere is not reached. However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, hereafter referred to as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider these two scenarios for the Pluto-Charon system, examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charon's formation, and propose that capture is a likelier option. We investigate Scenario 2, both analytically and numerically, where the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent. In Scenario 2, the greater initial orbital separation between the partners reduces tidally induced thermal processes and fracturing, as compared to Scenario 1. In several study cases, we also observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin-orbit resonances (3:2 to 7:2) in the first 0.5Myr of the system's evolution.",

    "title": "Prospects for measuring the Doppler magnification dipole with LSST and DESI",
    "abstract": "We forecast the detectability of the Doppler magnification dipole with a joint analysis of galaxy spectroscopic redshifts and size measurements. The Doppler magnification arises from an apparent size variation caused by galaxies' peculiar velocities when mapping them from redshift space to real space. This phenomenon is the dominant contribution to the convergence at low redshifts ($\\lesssim$ 0.5). A practical observational strategy is to cross-correlate a galaxy number count tracer, e.g. from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey, with the convergence field reconstructed from galaxy size measurements obtained by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To assess the achievable precision of galaxy size measurements, we simulate LSST Y1-quality galaxy images with Galsim and measure them with the Galight profile fitting package. Our investigations, based on galaxy populations from LSST's synthetic galaxy catalogue cosmoDC2, show that the variance due to intrinsic galaxy size variation dominates over size measurement errors as expected, but may be lower than previous studies have suggested. Under our analysis assumptions, the Doppler magnification dipole would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\\geq 10$ in multiple redshift bins between $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$ with DESI spectroscopic redshifts and LSST imaging.",

    "abstract": "Earth-like exoplanets can create resonant structures in exozodiacal dust through mean motion resonances (MMRs). These structures not only suggest the presence of such planets, but also act as potential noise sources in future mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometry observations. We aim to investigate how resonant structures in exozodiacal dust vary across stellar spectral types (F4--M4), and to evaluate how stellar wind drag affects their morphology and brightness in mature planetary systems. We conducted numerical simulations of dust dynamics, extending earlier studies by including spectral type variation in stellar wind drag in addition to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag. Our models represented systems of a few Gyr hosting an Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone (HZ). We produced spatially resolved maps of optical depth and thermal emission for different stellar spectral types. Our simulations showed that resonant ring structures were formed for all stellar spectral types considered. In particular, we found that stellar wind drag played a critical role in shaping dust dynamics around old M-type stars, where it could dominate over PR drag by a factor of approximately 44. This reduced the contrast of resonant rings relative to the background disk, compared to cases without spectral type variation in stellar wind. Across different spectral types, the optical depth contrast of the resonant ring increased for lower-mass stars, assuming a fixed background level. Asymmetric thermal emission distributions were derived across all spectral types, which peaked for K-type stars. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both resonant dynamics and stellar wind effects when modeling exozodiacal dust around stars of different spectral types.",

For this binary, we performed a timing analysis using 16 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering the period from 2008 August to 2024 October. Our analysis detected an orbital modulation with a period of 0.2279781 days at a significance level of $\\sim4\\sigma$, which is in good agreement with previous findings. However, unlike previous reports, we identified a transition in the orbital modulation around 2021 August, after which the orbital signal disappeared. We speculate that the system may be undergoing a transition from a rotation-powered to an accretion-powered state at this epoch. Additionally, we conducted the phase-resolved and spectral analyses, and in the phase-resolved results, we observed an anti-correlation between its $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray emissions, which consistent with the predictions of high-energy radiation models for such systems. We provide some predictive discussions based on the results of $\\gamma$-ray data analysis, and future Fermi-LAT observations will determine whether these predictions hold true.",

They consist of a white dwarf accreting hydrogen deficient material from a degenerate or semi-degenerate star and are predicted to be amongst the verification sources for future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Using the recent catalogue of Green et al (2025) I focus attention on the orbital period range in which outbursts are seen from AM CVn's. I examine in more detail the outburst properties of KL Dra which has an outburst every few months and has many sectors of TESS data as an open resource. Using observational data on the outbursting systems in general, I compare the outburst recurrence time, duration and amplitude as a function of orbital period with the predictions of the disc instability model. The recurrence time is well described, although there is some evidence that the amount of material in the disc at the end of the quiescence phase is less than earlier model assumptions. The distribution of the outburst duration appears to be dependent on the cadence of the observations and how it is defined. Similarly the amplitude distribution is dependent on cadence and the filter, which causes an apparent spread in distribution. Both of these features need to be systematically studied using consistent benchmarks. AM CVn binaries remain an excellent sources to test models which aim to predict the properties of disc accreting systems.",

In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary \"bones\" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.",

In this work, we calibrate all four tomographic bins of the Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) weak lensing catalog with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 and 2 using the clustering redshifts technique. We include $z>1.2$ redshift sources such as emission line galaxies (ELG) and quasars (QSO) sources in our calibration, which were not available in the previous HSC calibration (Rau et al. 2022, arXiv:2211.16516 ), allowing a complete calibration of all the redshift bins. We find the first tomographic bin exhibits a small shift towards low redshifts. The second bin is in good agreement with the photometric calibration, while third and fourth bin exhibit a shift towards higher redshifts. However, these shifts are considerably smaller than the shifts obtained in the HSC Year 3 cosmic shear analyses. We evaluate the impact of galaxy bias and magnification effects from all the samples on the measurements, finding them to be small, and we propose corrections to reduce them further. We model the redshift distributions with splines and compare our results to previous analyses as well as to other parameterizations found in literature. For the two high-redshift tomographic bins, we find the shifts to higher redshifts with respect to the measurements performed in Rau+2022 to be $\\Delta z_3=-0.039^{+0.020}_{-0.021}$ and $\\Delta z_4=-0.048^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$.",

    "abstract": "We reanalyze cosmological constraints from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Y3 shear-shear correlation function using new calibration of the tomographic redshift distribution via the clustering redshifts method with DESI spectroscopy presented in Choppin de Janvry et al. (2025a). We present both importance sampling of the original MCMC chains by HSC, applying the weights of our newly calibrated $\\Delta z$ priors, as well as full MCMC analysis with new photometric redshift distributions, finding consistent results between the two. We obtain the growth of structure parameter $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_m/0.3}=0.805\\pm{0.018}$, compared to previous HSC Y3 result of $S_8=0.769^{+0.031}_{-0.034}$, which is a 1.8 reduction of error due to the improved clustering redshift calibrations, with the central value shifting considerably higher towards Planck cosmology. With the new photometric redshift calibration, HSC Y3 has comparable constraining power to the recent KIDS Legacy and DES Y3. Combining all three gives $S_8=0.813^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, which can be compared to $S_8=0.828\\pm 0.012$ from CMB lensing. Overall there is no evidence for deviation from Planck on $S_8$ in any of the weak lensing analyses, and combining galaxy lensing with CMB lensing gives a sub-percent constraint $S_8=0.818\\pm 0.007$, comparable in both precision and value to the most recent Planck+ACT+DESI constraint $S_8=0.812\\pm 0.007$.",

    "abstract": "The highest-energy cosmic neutrino detected by the ARCA detector of KM3NeT has reignited the quest to pinpoint the sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\\gtrsim 0.1$ EeV). By uncovering the associated multimessenger signals, we investigate the origin of the 220 PeV $\\nu_\\mu$ event KM3-230213A from a transient source that accelerated cosmic rays to $\\sim 10$ EeV. UHECR protons that escape the source interact with the cosmic background radiation, producing a PeV-EeV cosmogenic neutrino spectrum. The secondary $e^\\pm$ and $\\gamma$-rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade, resulting in a cosmogenic $\\gamma$-ray spectrum that peaks at a delayed time due to deflection of charged particles in the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Our results shed light on the nature of the UHECR source for the $\\nu_\\mu$ event and provide crucial insights into the detection of multi-TeV $\\gamma$-rays of cosmogenic origin from similar past cosmological transients. Using the $\\gamma$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $\\gamma$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength. Together with the non-detection of coincident spatial or temporal photon counterparts at the current epoch, this detection is the first compelling candidate for a sub-EeV cosmogenic neutrino.",

    "abstract": "JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \\texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\\% larger in NRS1 and 12\\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.",

    "title": "Tracing Quenching in Nearby Galaxies Through Inner Surface Mass Density and Cold Gas Content",
    "abstract": "The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. However, the dependence of cold gas content on Sigma1 has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we examine the relationship between Sigma1, as well as the mass-relative parameter delSigma1, and the atomic (fHI) and molecular (fH2) cold gas fractions in massive, nearby galaxies. We utilize a sample of 341 galaxies with HI data and 201 galaxies with H2 data from the xGASS and xCOLDGASS surveys, spanning 0.02 <= z <= 0.05 and a stellar mass range of 10^10 <= M_*/M_odot <= 10^11.5. While we observe that a decline in both fHI and fH2 is associated with increasing Sigma1, we find that fH2 shows a sharper decline above a threshold value of delSigma1 = 0. In addition, the fraction of galaxies with AGN activity (Seyferts and LINERs) increases with delSigma1, with the greatest increase occurring between 0 <= delSigma1 <= 0.2 dex. We propose an evolutionary track in the plane of fH2-delSigma1, whereby molecular gas depletion at fixed mass coincides with a rise in AGN activity. Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.",

We confirm the presence of a low-luminosity (presumably Compton-thick) AGN. The 0.4$-$12 keV luminosity and the hardness ratio of the six ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) previously identified in Chandra data exhibit diverse variability on day-scale. The collective emission from unresolved sources exhibits a different day-scale variability. We have also discovered two new predominantly soft ($<1$ keV) sources. One of these has an enigmatic spectral shape featuring a soft component, which we interpret as a superbubble in NGC 3221, and a variable hard component from a compact object, which is unresolved from the superbubble. We do not confidently detect any X-ray emission from SN 1961L. The hot gas in the ISM (out to $\\pm$6 kpc from the disk plane) and the extraplanar region (6$-$12 kpc) both require two thermal phases at $\\sim 0.15$ keV and $\\sim 0.55$ keV. The $\\sim 0.55$ keV component is fainter in the ISM than the $\\sim 0.15$ keV component, but the emission from the latter falls off more steeply with disk height than the former. This makes the extraplanar region hotter and less dense than the ISM. The proximity of NGC 3221 and the occurrence of the underluminous AGN offer a unique observing opportunity to study the hot diffuse medium in conjunction with nuclear and disk-wide point sources.",

Our results show that the non-perturbative $\\delta N$ method provides a reliable estimate across a wide range of reheating time and Higgs field values, including regimes where the Higgs field oscillates significantly after inflation. We find that a smaller Higgs self-coupling ($\\lambda$) leads to a larger curvature perturbation, with the non-Gaussianity predominantly taking a local shape. This highlights the importance of considering non-perturbative effects in calculating the curvature perturbation during Higgs modulated reheating, especially for smaller values of $\\lambda$. Our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of reheating and the generation of primordial perturbations in the early Universe.",

Contrary to the established consensus that pulsar spectra are predominantly simple power laws, our analysis reveals that complex spectral shapes with curvature or breaks are in fact the norm. The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\\%, with 68.8\\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work.",

Based on observational data of SVOM/GRM and Fermi/GBM, we perform a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis for individual pulse in the prompt emission of this burst, and novel characteristics are revealed. Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\\rm g}$ with $t_{\\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\\rm g}$.",

In this work, we study the projection effect in transverse BAO, namely the mixing of BAO signals from different epochs caused by $z_c$ uncertainty within a chosen bin. We focus our forecast on two surveys of interest: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) HI galaxy redshift survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)'s final Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. We test the sensitivity in finding the transverse BAO depending of three bin configurations: a Gaussian, a top-hat and an intermediate of them semi-Gaussian. We also analyse the precision the bin widths $\\sigma_z$ from smaller to wider bins $0.01<\\sigma_z<0.1$. In order to correct these deviations, we propose a correction based on adjacent redshift to $z_c$, this would provide a semi-statistical correction instead of only relying on fiducial cosmology. Finally, we conclude that despite the higher shot-noise than the top-hat bin separation, the semi-Gaussian bin is the most accurate case to find the BAO signal and to constrain parameters through the angular power spectrum. A Gaussian binning gives the least precise parameter constraints compared to the other two cases.",

    "abstract": "Many circumstellar dust scattering regions have been detected and investigated with polarimetric imaging. However, the quantitative determination of the intrinsic polarization and of dust properties is difficult because of complex observational effects. This work investigates instrumental convolution and polarimetric calibration effect for high contrast imaging polarimetry with the aim to define procedures for accurate measurements of the circumstellar polarization. For this we simulate the instrumental convolution and polarimetric cancellation effects for a Gaussian PSF and an extended PSF_{AO} typical for a modern adaptive optics system. Further, polarimetric zero-point corrections (zp-corrections) are simulated for different cases like coronagraphic observations or systems with barely resolved circumstellar scattering regions. We find that the PSF convolution reduces the integrated azimuthal polarization Q_phi for the scattering region while the net Stokes signals Q and U are not changed. For non-axisymmetric systems a spurious U_phi-signal is introduced. These effects are strong for compact systems but scattering regions can still be detected down to small separations while unresolved scattering regions can be constrained by the central Stokes Q,U signal. The smearing by PSF_{AO} produces an extended, low surface brightness polarization signal changing the angular distribution of the polarization, but the initial signal can be recovered partly from the Stokes Q and U quadrant pattern. A polarimetric zp-correction applied for the removal of offsets from instrumental or interstellar polarization depends on the selected reference region and can also introduce strong bias effects for the azimuthal distribution of the polarization signal. Strategies for the zp-correction are described for coronagraphic data or observations of partly unresolved systems.",

The 21 cm intensity mapping (21 cm IM) technique enables rapid large-area surveys that can deliver these measurements. China is constructing three hundred-meter-class single-dish radio telescopes, including the QiTai 110 m Radio Telescope (QTT), the 120 m Jingdong Radio Telescope (JRT), and the 120 m Huadian Radio Telescope (HRT), whose designs are well suited for 21 cm IM cosmology. We use a Fisher-to-MCMC forecasting framework to evaluate the baryon acoustic oscillations / redshift space distortions (BAO/RSD) measurement capabilities of QTT, JRT, and HRT and propagate them to dark-energy constraints in the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our results show that achieving a redshift coverage up to $z_{\\mathrm{max}} = 1$ is crucial for fully realising the potential of hundred-meter-class single-dish telescopes for 21 cm cosmology. If all three telescopes carry out 21 cm IM surveys over the same redshift range up to $z_{\\mathrm{max}}=1$ and combine their BAO/RSD measurements, QTT+JRT+HRT yield $\\sigma(w_0)=0.094$ and $\\sigma(w_a)=0.487$, providing tighter constraints than DESI DR2 results.",

    "title": "Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves",
    "abstract": "Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. Bracketing the critical curve with sparse lensed image pairs of compact continuum sources may not be sufficient as additional information available throughout the extended arc is not used. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of nebular emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23\" ($1\\sigma$). This reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\\alpha$ line at SNR $\\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty may improve to 0.12\" (0.08\"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve where it crosses the giant arc, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs in extragalactic lensing fields and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.",

    "title": "Synthesis imaging with a lunar orbit array: I. global sky map and its systematics",
    "abstract": "Ground-based radio astronomical observation at frequencies below 30 MHz is hampered by the Ionosphere and radio frequency interference (RFI). The Discovering Sky at the Longest wavelength (DSL) mission, also known as the Hongmeng mission, employs a linear array of satellites on a circular orbit around the Moon to make interferometric observations in this band. Though vastly different from the usual ground-based arrays, the interferometric visibility data collected by such an array is linearly related to the sky map, and the reconstruction is in principle an inversion problem of linear mapping. In this paper, we investigate a number of issues in the algorithm of global map reconstruction, focusing on the impact of sub-pixel noise induced by the finite pixelization of the sky, and errors due to regularization. We find that in the reconstruction process, if one builds up the beam matrix, which relates the sky pixels to the visibilities, by naively evaluating its elements at each of the pixel centers, then the sub-pixel noise can give rise to a significant aliasing effect. However, this effect can be effectively mitigated by a simple pixel-averaging method. Based on evaluation of the image quality using the correlation coefficient between the input and reconstructed map, and the signal-to-noise ratio, we discuss the selection strategy of the regularization parameter, and show that the sky can be well reconstructed with a reasonable choice of the regularization parameter.",

    "abstract": "Observations of transiting hot Jupiters have revealed a mismatch between the values of the Bond versus geometric albedos. In the planetary science literature, the ratio of these quantities is known as the phase integral. It has been extensively measured for the Solar System planets and shown to generally be non-unity in value. We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\\sim 3\\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth. The upcoming Ariel space mission will conduct an unprecedented statistical survey of cloud cover on hot Jupiters via the simultaneous measurement of $\\sim 100$ infrared phase curves and optical secondary eclipses. Whenever available, the shape of optical phase curves of reflected light will directly constrain the phase integral, spherical albedo, degree of cloud cover and scattering asymmetry factor.",

Leveraging the increased source density of the POlarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), we probe the magnetic field properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 3581 {(A3581)} with 111 RMs. We find that the standard deviation in the RM declines monotonically with increasing radius up to 0.75 Mpc{, agreeing with a radially declining magnetic field and electron density profile modeled as Gaussian and lognormal random fields, respectively. {We compare our observations of the inner 0.75 Mpc of A3581 to various semi-analytic models of the magnetic field and electron density, and obtain several best-fit models.} For the first time, we compare the observed RMs in a cluster to full magnetohydrodynamic simulated clusters from TNG-Cluster and find that the non-monotonic trend in RM standard deviation past 0.75 Mpc in A3581 is likely caused by past or present merger activity. We identify a possible candidate for a merger to be the galaxy group [DZ2015b] 276, which would be the first group detected in RMs that is not strongly emitting in X-rays.

    "abstract": "Core-collapse supernovae mark the end of life of massive stars. However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.",

Depending on accretion rates, these systems can develop both proton and neutron-rich atmospheres with strong convective instabilities linking the neutrino sphere to the outgoing accretion shock inside the radia tion trapping zone. Convection drives nucleons through multiple heating and cooling cycles, with photodisintegration dominat ing during the heating phase and heavy element synthesis during the cooling phase, ejecting material with abundances that dep end on the accretion rate and depth of the final decompression trajectory. The turbulent nature of convective currents is con ducive to creating a wide range of nuclear products through a variety of effects, including NSE freezeout and $r$, $p$ and $\\ gamma$ processes. We also observe a novel multi-step process in reheated trajectories, consisting of proton-capture and photo-dissociation reactions operating on $r$-process seeds, producing overall neutron-deficient isotopes. A significant amount of infalling gas experiences high entropy and short (millisecond) freezeout timescales capable of making $r$-process elements w ith high over-abundances through a disequilibrium effect between neutrons and $\\alpha$-particles that does not require an excess of neutrons.",

Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based \"top_$k$ soft matching\" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\\sim$46% ($\\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\\sim$87% ($\\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.",

These absorbers exhibit position and kinematic alignment and show consistent ionization trends with previously studied MS sight lines. The non-detection of low ions such as Al II and Si II, and the detection of C IV (and Si IV in some sightlines), indicates a highly ionized gas phase. The observed Si IV/C IV column density ratios suggest a gas temperature of $T \\sim 10^{5.3}$~K and favor collisional ionization over photoionization. We estimate the newly detected extension increases the previous ionized gas mass of the MS, and its coherent kinematics suggest that it was stripped within the past few hundred Myr and has not yet mixed with the Milky Way halo.

    "abstract": "The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| <= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 < 0.02) and high (z0 >= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma < 0.05), filament (0.05 <= Sigma < 0.5), group (0.5 <= Sigma < 2.0), and cluster (Sigma >= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z < 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D < 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z > 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.",

In this work, we present order-of-magnitude calculations of the energetics associated with this proposed jet-NLR interaction.

This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the optical spectral variability recorded with the X-shooter and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instruments.

    "abstract": "Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) provide a powerful probe of early-universe physics, linking inflationary fluctuations to observable cosmological phenomena. In this work, we use a bottom-up approach to study how PBHs with masses in the range $10^{8} \\leq M \\leq 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ modify Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through Hawking radiation. We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \\approx 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \\geq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \\leq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.",

    "title": "Disc breaking and parametric instability in warped accretion discs",
    "abstract": "We present the first local simulations of disc breaking/tearing in a warped accretion disc. Warps can arise due to a misalignment between the disc and the rotation axis of the central object, or a misalignment with the orbital plane of a binary (or planetary) companion. Warped discs can break into rings, as found in observations of circumbinary protoplanetary discs and global simulations of tilted discs around spinning black holes. In this work we isolate the mechanism of disc breaking in high-resolution, quasi-2D, local (shearing box), hydrodynamic simulations of a Keplerian disc. We consider the evolution of a free (unforced) warp in the wavelike ($\\alpha < H/r$) regime. At large warp amplitudes ($\\psi_{\\text{max}} \\gtrsim 1$) the disc breaks into four rings on timescales of around 20 orbits which are separated by gaps of around $\\sim 10H_0$. The warp exhibits a rich tapestry of small-scale dynamics, including horizontal sloshing motions, vertical oscillations or bouncing, warp steepening, and shocks. The shocks act as a source of enhanced dissipation which facilitates gap opening and thus disc breaking. At smaller warp amplitudes $\\psi_{\\text{max}} \\lesssim 1$, for which we also develop a quasi-linear theory, the disc does not break, but instead exhibits hydrodynamic parametric instability. We also investigate the effect of viscosity: at small warp amplitudes the parametric instability is damped and the warp propagates as a pure bending wave, while at large warp amplitudes the emerging gaps are partially filled by viscous diffusion.",

    "title": "How Complex is Dark Energy? A Bayesian Analysis of CPL Extensions with Recent DESI BAO Measurements",
    "abstract": "The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.",

    "title": "Fast Radio Bursts from White Dwarf Binary Mergers: Isolated and Triple-Induced Channels",
    "abstract": "The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \\approx 2\\times10^4~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.",

    "title": "A Smooth Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs from the Radial Occurrence Distribution",
    "abstract": "Measuring the occurrence rates of celestial objects is a valuable way to study their origins and evolution. Giant planets and brown dwarfs produce large Doppler signatures that are easily detectable by modern instrumentation, and legacy radial velocity (RV) surveys have now achieved full orbital coverage for periods $\\lesssim$30 years. However, the Doppler method's sensitivity to companion minimum mass $M_c \\sin i$ -- as opposed to true mass $M_c$ -- prevents unambiguous characterization using RVs alone, as purported giant planets may be brown dwarfs or stars on inclined orbits. Here we combined legacy RVs with absolute astrometry to re-fit the orbits of 195 companions from the California Legacy Survey. Nearly 50% (8/18) of the ``brown dwarfs\" ($M_c \\sin i$=13--80 $M_{Jup}$) we refit had true masses above 80 $M_{Jup}$. We incorporated our orbital posteriors and target sensitivity maps into a Poisson likelihood model to calculate occurrence as a function of true companion mass $M_c$ (0.8--80 $M_{Jup}$) and separation $a$ (0.3--30 AU). The semi-major axis distributions of objects in this range vary smoothly with mass, with Jupiter analogs favoring an abrupt increase in occurrence near 1 AU and brown dwarfs exhibiting a gradual enhancement at wider separations. Marginalized companion occurrence between 1--10 AU decreases smoothly with mass, with brown dwarfs having the lowest occurrence rate: $0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$%. Jupiter analogs are 10 times as common as brown dwarfs per mass interval in this range, demonstrating that the brown dwarf desert extends to 10 AU. The smooth variation in these distributions disfavors a sharp transition mass between ``bottom-up\" core accretion and ``top-down\" gravitational instability formation mechanisms, and rather suggests that these processes may produce companions in overlapping mass ranges.",

This effect are less pronounced with smaller stopping times, stronger gaseous turbulence or imperfect sticking. Regarding planetary migration, we find that CMs make outward migration require $\\tau \\gtrsim 0.3$ ($\\tau$ is dimensionless stopping time) with typical turbulent strength and dust coagulation efficiency.

    "abstract": "We revisit the tidal evolution of the WASP-12 system using direct numerical calculations with the GYRE-tides code. WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter on a 1.1-day orbit around a slightly evolved F-type star. Its observed orbital decay rate, $|\\dot{P}_{\\rm orb}/P_{\\rm orb}| \\approx 3.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, provides a strong constraint on stellar tidal dissipation. We confirm that linear tides with radiative damping and convective damping, as currently implemented, are not sufficient to reproduce the observed inspiral timescale. Nevertheless, our calculations, based on fully non-adiabatic forced oscillations in MESA stellar models with convective envelopes, yield dissipation rates that are consistent with previous semi-analytic and adiabatic estimates, confirming the robustness of our numerical framework. As the only open-source, actively maintained tool capable of computing orbital evolution in exoplanet systems, GYRE-tides provides a benchmark calculation for WASP-12 and future applications. Our results validate GYRE-tides as a tool for analyzing combined radiative and convective damping, and indicate that the observed decay rate requires tidal dissipation operating in or near the fully damped regime, which may be achieved through nonlinear damping. These contributions could also be evaluated by computing the wave luminosity at the radiative-convective boundary using our tool. GYRE-tides offers an open-source framework for computing tidal dissipation in short-period exoplanet systems, including the many systems expected to show orbital decay in upcoming Roman surveys.",

Icy bodies display a remarkable diversity of geological, geophysical, and atmospheric processes, which differ fundamentally from those of the rocky terrestrial planets. Evidence from past and ongoing spacecraft missions has revealed subsurface oceans, cryovolcanic activity, and tenuous but persistent atmospheres, showing that icy bodies are active and evolving worlds. At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies. Their findings, combined with continued Earth- and space-based observations and laboratory studies, will be critical for assessing the potential habitability of these environments and for placing them within a broader framework of planetary system formation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of time-domain surveys, the volume of light curves has increased rapidly. However, many survey projects, such as Gaia, still rely on offline batch-processing workflows in which data are calibrated, merged, and released only after an observing phase is completed. This latency delays scientific analysis and causes many high-value transient events to be buried in archival data, missing the window for timely follow-up. While existing alert brokers handle heterogeneous data streams, it remains difficult to deploy a unified framework that combines high-performance incremental storage with real-time classification on local infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose TDLight, a scalable system that adapts the time-series database TDengine (a high-performance IoT database) for astronomical data using a one-table-per-source schema. This architecture supports high-throughput ingestion, achieving 954,000 rows s^-1 for archived data and 541,000 rows s^-1 for incremental streams, while Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) indexing enables efficient cone-search queries. Building on this storage layer, we integrate the pre-trained hierarchical Random Forest classifier from the LEAVES framework to construct an incremental classification pipeline. Using the LEAVES dataset, we simulate data accumulation and evaluate a trigger-based strategy that performs early classification at specific observational milestones. In addition, by monitoring the evolution of classification probabilities, the system identifies \"high-value candidates\" -- sources that show high early confidence but later undergo significant label shifts. TDLight is released as an open-source Dockerized environment, providing a deployable infrastructure for next-generation time-domain surveys.",

    "abstract": "The earliest phase of the Milky Way's evolution involved a transition from a dispersion-supported proto-galaxy to a rotationally supported disk. A key chemical signature of this transition is the moderate rise in [$\\alpha$/Fe] near $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\approx-1.3$, which we previously interpreted as evidence for $\\alpha$-enhanced gas accretion fueling early disk formation. However, this trend alone does not uniquely constrain the trade-off between initial gas mass, inflow rate, and star formation efficiency (SFE), leaving the physical condition of the proto-Milky Way uncertain. To break this degeneracy, we analyze the metal-poor tail ($-3<\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-2$) of the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) using Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) metallicities from ten catalogs. After applying recommended quality cuts, all catalogs exhibit a single-slope exponential tail with slopes $k\\simeq0.5$--2.0. Comparison with one-zone galactic chemical-evolution (GCE) models that replicated the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-rise from Paper I shows that shallow tails ($k\\simeq0.6$) require a massive initial cold gas reservoir ($\\gtrsim10^9\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), while steeper tails ($k\\gtrsim1$) arise from small reservoirs that built up over time with weak inflow. MDFs with $k \\simeq 1.0$ are best reproduced under our GCE framework, which favor a proto-Galaxy with a moderate gas reservoir ($10^{8}$--$10^{9}\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) sustained through weak continuous inflow ($\\sim 2 \\ \\mathrm{M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$) and SFE comparable to today's value (a few $\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) during the first Gyr. This scenario is reinforced by MDFs of 30 Milky Way analogs in the Auriga simulations, which exhibit similar slopes ($k\\approx1.2$). The metal-poor MDF tail thus provides a quantitative constraint on the Milky Way's early gas accretion and star formation history.",

The target systems exhibiting parabolic trends demonstrated a sustained decrease in their orbital periods over time. We modeled the light curves utilizing the PHOEBE Python code in combination with the BSN application. We revisited the relationship between orbital period and the temperature of the hotter component in contact binary systems using an empirical approach. Our analysis identified a clear break at P=0.27 days, separating the systems into two distinct groups for orbital periods shorter than 0.6 days. Following the determination of stellar extinction, absolute parameters for seven systems were estimated employing parallax measurements from Gaia DR3. Based on the components' effective temperatures and masses, the systems were classified into A- and W-subtypes.

    "abstract": "Some of the most interesting insights into solar physics and space weather come from studying radio emissions associated with solar activity, which remain inherently unpredictable. Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.",

It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $\\Omega_a/\\Omega_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $\\Omega_a/\\Omega_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs.",

    "title": "On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework",
    "abstract": "Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.",

    "title": "The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum",
    "abstract": "With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.",

    "title": "The complex inner disk of the Herbig Ae star HD 100453 with VLTI/MATISSE",
    "abstract": "The inner regions of planet-forming disks hold invaluable insights for our understanding of planet formation. The disk around the Herbig star HD 100453 presents one such environment, with an inner disk that is significantly misaligned with respect to the outer disk. This paper expands the existing H-band (PIONIER) and K-band (GRAVITY) interferometric studies of the HD 100453 inner disk to the L-band with the MATISSE VLTI instrument. With snapshot data spanning approximately four years we aim for a more comprehensive understanding of the inner disk structures and their potential time evolution. Based on the MATISSE data obtained, we use a combination of analytical models and image reconstruction to constrain the disk structure. Additionally, we fit a temperature gradient model to the selected wavelength range of PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE to derive physical properties of the inner regions. Our parametric model finds an inclination of $\\sim 47.5^\\circ$ and a position angle of $\\sim 83.6^\\circ$, which corroborates the case of strong inner-outer disk misalignment. From the symmetric temperature gradient we derive an inner disk radius around $\\sim0.27$ au, with dust surface densities of $\\Sigma_{\\rm{subl}} \\approx 10^{-3.2}$ g/cm$^2$ and vertical optical depth $\\tau_{\\rm{z, subl}} \\approx 0.1-0.06$. Same-night MATISSE and GRAVITY observations indicate the necessity for higher-order asymmetries to explain the interferometric signals, which is further supported by a MATISSE snapshot image reconstruction. The chromatic interferometric data reveal the likely need for higher-order asymmetries to explain the inner disk of HD~100453, suggesting a possible origin in dynamic interactions or disk instabilities. Coordinated multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations with GRAVITY and MATISSE will be crucial to confirm these findings and uncover its underlying nature.",

    "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy of sub-Neptunes was expected to reveal their compositions and hence origins, yet many show flat near- to mid-infrared spectra. Such spectra can be explained either by metal dominated atmospheres or by high-altitude, grey aerosols. Observations of escaping hydrogen and helium from several of these planets rule out metal dominated atmospheres, while homogeneous distributions of small aerosols cannot produce flat spectra and large particles require unphysically high production rates. We investigate the role of heterogeneous, \"clumpy\" aerosol distributions in shaping transmission spectra. Modestly optically thick clumps at high altitudes can produce flat spectra even with small particles and physically realistic production rates. Clumping increases the effective photon mean-free path while reducing wavelength dependence, allowing the aerosol distribution to behave as an effective grey absorber. Applying this framework to the sub-Neptune TOI-776c, we show that clumpy aerosols can reconcile the observed flattening of its transmission spectrum with a primordial H/He-dominated atmosphere. We further discuss implications for emission spectra, where enhanced stellar radiation penetration and altered scattering in a clumpy medium could produce observable signatures. These results suggest that clumpy aerosol distributions naturally resolve the tension between flat spectra and low-metallicity atmospheres and may be a common feature of sub-Neptune exoplanets. More broadly, our results highlight the need to consider aerosol heterogeneity when interpreting high-altitude microphysics and the spectral appearance of exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, and motivate theoretical work to identify the physical mechanisms capable of generating clumpy aerosol distributions.",

    "title": "Enhancing Fast Radio Transient Detection with Mask R-CNN Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, fast radio transient searches are conducted on dedispersed time series using thresholding techniques based on the statistical properties of the data. However, peaks in dedispersed time series do not directly provide information on the nature of the source. In the DM-time domain, the S/N variation of real, dispersed astrophysical signals forms a characteristic bow tie shape, whereas radio frequency interference (RFI) can take multiple different forms. We have developed a method that bypasses the thresholding step of traditional single-pulse searches in favour of a direct DM-time domain image analysis. The backbone of our pipeline is a Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model designed for object detection, enabling it to identify the bow tie signature and distinguish real sources from RFI. Previous deep learning models often include a snippet of the DM-time domain in their input. We have trained the model on simulated bursts injected on top of real MeerKAT noise observations. We tested the model on MeerKAT follow-up observations of the repeater FRB20240114A and we were able to recover all bursts with a signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold, while detecting two bursts that were fainter. Our new approach considerably reduces the number of candidates above a nominal threshold while being capable of running in real time for typical surveys. We also propose a modified version of the traditional dedispersion plan optimised for this method.",

    "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) correspond to the destruction of a star by the tidal forces around a black hole, leading to outbursts which can last from months to years. These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers.",

In addition to these observations, KoSO has preserved hand-drawn suncharts (1904-2022), on which various solar features such as sunspots, plages, filaments, and prominences are marked on the Stonyhurst grid with distinct colour coding. In this study, we present the first comprehensive result that includes the entire data set from these suncharts using a supervised Machine Learning model called \"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\", firstly to identify the solar disks from the charts (1909-2007), secondly to identify the plages, spanning 9 solar cycles (1916-2007). We train the CNN with the manually identified solar disk and plage. We first detect the solar limb and the North-South line in the suncharts, which enables the extraction of disk centre coordinates, radius, and P-angle. Following that, we use a CNN similar architecture to achieve accurate image segmentation for the identification of plages. We compare plage areas derived from the suncharts with those obtained from Ca II K full-disk observations, and find good agreement that demonstrates the potential application of such an ML technique for historical data. The results of this study further demonstrate the potential application of sunchart data to fill the existing data gaps in the KoSO multi-wavelength observations and contribute toward constructing a composite series over the last century.",

We propose that the expanding gas formed from volatile materials by collisional heating dispersed and cooled the silicate melt, resulting in droplet sizes and cooling rates consistent with the observed sizes and inferred cooling rates.

We first tested the feasibility of our method using Fourier local correlation tracking (FLCT) to track physical quantities at different optical depths ($\\log\\tau_{500}={-1,-2,-3,-4}$) in an atmosphere simulated with the MURaM code. We then inferred the horizontal distribution of the LOS magnetic field component from synthetic spectropolarimetric observations of Fe I 525.0 nm and Mg I b2 spectral lines, applied FLCT to the time sequence of these synthetic magnetograms, and compared our findings with the original height-dependent horizontal velocities. Tracking the LOS magnetic field component (which coincides with the vertical component at the disk center) yields horizontal velocities that, after appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, agree excellently with the horizontal component of the simulated velocities, both calculated at constant $\\tau_{500}$ surfaces, up to the temperature minimum ($\\log\\tau_{500}=-3$). When tracking the temperature at constant $\\tau_{500}$ surfaces, this agreement already breaks down completely at the mid photosphere ($\\log\\tau_{500}=-2$). Tracking the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from synthetic observations of the Fe I 525.0 nm and the Mg I b2 spectral lines yields a satisfactory inference of the horizontal velocities in the mid-photosphere ($\\log\\tau_{500}\\approx-1$) and the temperature minimum ($\\log\\tau_{500}\\approx-3$), respectively.

    "abstract": "Solar flares are explosive releases of magnetic energy stored in the solar corona, driven by magnetic reconnection. These events accelerate electrons, generating hard X-ray emissions and often display Quasi Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) across the energy spectra. However, the energy transfer process remains poorly constrained, with competing theories proposing different acceleration mechanisms. We investigate electron acceleration and transport in a flaring coronal loop by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. Our model incorporates transient turbulent acceleration, simulating the effects of impulsive energy input to emulate the dynamics of time-dependent reconnection processes. We compute the density-weighted electron flux, a diagnostic directly comparable to observed X-ray emissions, across the energy and spatial domains from the corona to the chromosphere. We investigate different time-dependent functional forms of the turbulent acceleration, finding that the functional form of the acceleration source maintains its signature across energy bands (1 to 100 keV) with a response time that is energy dependent (with higher energy bands displaying a longer response time). In addition, we find that (a) for a square pulse the switch on and off response time is different; (b) for a sinusoidal input the periodicity is preserved; and (c) for a damped sinusoidal the decay rate increases with density and higher energy bands lose energy faster. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing electron acceleration and transport in flares driven by time-dependent sources.",

Cosmogonic considerations suggest that this body may possess relatively high tensile strength and a substantial metal fraction. We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks inherit their chemical composition from their natal molecular cloud, but the extent to which this material is preserved versus reset through chemical reprocessing remains an open question. Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk.",

    "abstract": "To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \\textit{i.e.}\\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",

    "abstract": "We present the commissioning results and first scientific observations from the newly installed TWIST observatory - a 50 cm telescope equipped with an sCMOS camera providing a $36.1\\times24.1$ arcmin$^2$ field of view - housed in the former SuperWASP-North enclosure. We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible. Alongside the scientific results, we introduce a new correction technique for flat-field images affected by scattered light and present a full characterization of the observatory's photometric capabilities. These results demonstrate the scientific utility of TWIST for high-cadence time-domain surveys using modest-aperture instrumentation.",

    "title": "Towards testing gravity with LSST using $E_G$",
    "abstract": "$E_G$ is a summary statistic that combines cosmological observables to achieve a test of gravity that is relatively model-independent. Here, we consider the power of a measurement of $E_G$ using galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with sources from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We first update the theoretical framework for the covariance of $E_G$ to accommodate this Stage IV scenario. We then demonstrate that $E_G$ offers in principle a model-agnostic test of gravity using only linear-scale information, with the caveat that a careful treatment of galaxy bias is required. We finally address the persistent issue of $E_G$'s theoretical dependence on the measured value of $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$. We propose a framework that takes advantage of the posterior predictive test to consistently incorporate uncertainty on $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ in tests of gravity with $E_G$, which should be of general use beyond the LSST+DESI scenario. Our forecasting study using this method shows that the prior information available for $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ is instrumental in determining the power of $E_G$ in the LSST+DESI context. For the full survey dataset, with priors on $\\Omega_{\\rm M}^0$ from existing CMB data, we find that for some modified gravity scenarios considered, we are likely to be able to reject the GR null hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "We present the scientific case for exploiting the capabilities of the PLATO mission to study bright pulsating white dwarfs across a wide spectral range, including hydrogen-deficient types (GW Vir and DBV stars) and hydrogen-rich classes (classical DAVs, pulsating extremely low-mass DA white dwarfs, and ultra-massive DA white dwarfs). PLATOs exceptional photometric precision, long-duration continuous monitoring, and extensive sky coverage promise transformative advances in white dwarf asteroseismology. Our key objectives include probing the internal structure and chemical stratification of white dwarfs, detecting secular changes in pulsation modes over extended timescales, and discovering rare or previously unknown classes of pulsators. To assess feasibility, we constructed a sample of 650 white dwarf candidates identified within PLATOs Southern LOPS2 field using the PLATO complementary science catalogue combined with Gaia DR3, and derived atmospheric parameters through photometric modeling. This sample comprises 118 DA white dwarfs (including 23 ZZ Ceti candidates), and 41 non-DAs (including 35 DBV candidates). Simulated observations using PlatoSim demonstrate that PLATO will be capable of detecting white dwarf pulsation modes with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mma depending on stellar magnitude, observation duration, pixel location, and the number of contributing cameras. We provide detailed detection limits and visibility forecasts for known pulsators across a representative range of these parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize strong synergies with Gaia astrometry, TESS photometry, and targeted spectroscopic campaigns, which together will enable robust mode identification and detailed stellar modeling. Collectively, these efforts will unlock unprecedented insights into white dwarf origins, evolution and internal physics, and the fate of their planetary systems.",

This metric serves as a robust measure which is related to the inclination of a galaxy. We find an empirical relationship between $\\eta$ and inclination which is agnostic to the galaxy morphology.

    "abstract": "Sunspots depict large variability during the last 100 years, a period called the Modern Maximum (MM). However, other variables are needed to study the long-term evolution, e.g., of weaker fields and different radiative emissions. Recently, the relation between sunspots and the F10.7 and F30 radio fluxes and the MgII index (proxies of EUV irradiance) was found to vary during the last 70 years so that a relative sunspot dominance over EUV in the 1950s-1960s changed to EUV dominance in the 2000s (Mursula et al., 2024). Here we use data from eight long-operating observatories to calculate the yearly range of daily variation of the geomagnetic Y-component, the rY index, for the last 137 years. The rY index correlates very well with the MgII index and the solar F30 radio flux. These three indices have no trend relative to each other. On the other hand, the F10.7 flux has a significant trend with respect to the three co-varying EUV indices (MgII, F30, rY). Therefore, the rY index replaces F10.7 as the best long-term EUV proxy, and extends the MgII index by 90 years. We verify that all the four EUV proxies (rY, MgII, F30, F10.7) have an increasing trend with respect to sunspots during the last 50-70 years. This is valid both for sunspot numbers and group numbers. We find that the relation between rY index and sunspots has a quadratic evolution over the MM. The Sun has more sunspots relative to EUV irradiance during the growth and maximum of the MM, while the opposite is true during its decay. We estimate that the MgII index increases by 24\\% of its solar cycle variation with respect to the sunspot number during the last 70 years. Our results indicate a systematic difference in the evolution between sunspots (photosphere) and plages (chromosphere) with long-term solar activity. The implied varying spot-facula ratio has consequences to the stellar evolution of the Sun and Sun-like stars.",

    "abstract": "Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) have been argued to be related to the ejection of common envelopes (CEs) in binary star systems. Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers.",

This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $\\rho(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $\\sigma(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M_\\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.",

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \\times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission.",

    "abstract": "Model-independent approaches have gained increasing attention as powerful tools to investigate persistent tensions between cosmological observations and the predictions of $\\Lambda$CDM. Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $\\Omega_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\\sim1.7\\sigma$, with $\\Omega_k=-0.143\\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r_d=(144.00^{+5.38}_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,\\Omega_k,r_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\\sim$54% and on $r_d$ by $\\sim$66%, enabling a $\\sim2$% determination of $H_0$. Precision on $\\Omega_k$ will increase by $\\sim50$%. Our analysis outlines which improvements in future data - whether in quality, quantity, or redshift coverage - are likely to most effectively tighten these constraints.[abridged]",

    "abstract": "Statistically-significant differences in the value of the Hubble parameter are found depending on the measurement method that is used, a result known as the Hubble tension. A variety of ways of comparing, grouping, and excluding measurements have been used to try to explain this, either in terms of physical effects or systematic errors. We present a systematic 'Bayesian jackknife' analysis of 16 independent measurements of the Hubble parameter in an attempt to identify whether the measurements fall into meaningful clusters that would help explain the origin of the tension. After evaluating evidence ratios for the commonly-used split into early- vs late-time measurements, we then study a range of simplified alternative physical scenarios that reflect different physical origins of an apparent bias or shift in the value of $H_0$, assigning phenomenological population parameters to each subset. These include scenarios where specific subsets are biased (e.g. due to unrecognised experimental systematics in the local distance ladder or cosmic microwave background measurements), as well as more cosmologically-motivated cases involving modifications to the expansion history. Many of these scenarios have similar marginal likelihood, but the model where no measurements are biased is strongly disfavoured. Finally, we marginalise over all these scenarios to estimate the 'model agnostic' posterior distribution of $H_0$. The resulting distribution is mildly multi-modal, but modestly favours values near $H_0=68$ km/s/Mpc, with a 95\\% credible region of $66.7 < H_0 < 72.7$ km/s/Mpc.",

    "abstract": "Jets from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes provide the unique opportunity to study similar processes in two very different mass regimes. Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\\rm N(\\Gamma) \\propto \\Gamma^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1\\sigma$ for \\textit{Swift}-BAT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 \\sigma$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $\\Gamma_{\\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes.",

In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning Solar Cycles 1-24 (1755-2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265-year period. We modulate the active region tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r > 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265-year period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the compact objects within the supposed \"lower mass gap\" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.",

    "abstract": "The observation of multiple images from a strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) source provides the observer with a stereoscopic view of the source. This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "We present the characterization of macrolensing properties of the gravitationally lensed system PKS 1830-211, utilizing data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $\\mu_{\\gamma} \\lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia (MOI) for linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the MOI are more pronounced than those in the stellar mass profiles, suggesting that rotational observables are highly sensitive to geometric corrections. We also calculate a quasi-universal relation between the dimensionless MOI and compactness ($\\bar{I}$-$C$). The linear and quadratic models are generally consistent with observational data from PSR J0737-3039A, although the deviations are small and difficult to distinguish from General Relativity due to inherent EoS variability. On other hand, the logarithmic and exponential models show larger deviations (over 20 %), exceeding the EoS-induced uncertainty reported by Suleiman & Read (2024), highlighting the relation's sensitivity to the $f(Q)$ gravity model. These results indicate that $f(Q)$ gravity could potentially be tested in the strong-field regime and point to a direction for future studies, such as investigating EoS-insensitive quasi-universal relations, like the $\\bar{I}(\\Lambda)$ relations, within the $f(Q)$ framework. Such relations may provide a clearer pathway for exploring possible signatures in strong-field gravity when combined with more precise future observations.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.",

This work proposes a motion-field inversion framework that uses optical flow and rangefinder-based depth estimation as a lightweight CPU-based solution for egomotion estimation during lunar descent. We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We verify our approach using synthetically generated lunar images over the challenging terrain of the lunar south pole, using CPU budgets compatible with small lunar landers. The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications. This framework shows promise for enabling robust, lightweight on-board navigation for small lunar missions.",

This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, \"Phase-Modulated-sideband $\\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing\" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.",

The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\\mu_v\\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.",

We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.",

The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.",

    "abstract": "In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",

Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level.

    "abstract": "Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.",

    "title": "Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme",
    "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",

    "abstract": "Neutrinos can acquire \"refractive masses\" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \\times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.",

In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested \"bubbles-within-bubbles.\" When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.",

The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.",

We used a residual neural network (ResNet50) to perform multi-class classification of image samples constructed from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms. We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise. At galactic distances of 1 kpc and 5 kpc with H1 and L1 data and 1 kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from 0.8933 to 0.9867), which show the feasibility of our methodology. For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets.

    "abstract": "The Aitken method is a useful approach for decomposing mid-IR polarimetry of silicates in astronomical sources into emissive and absorptive components. Here we extend this method to include the effects of polarization caused by scattering from graphite or similar particles along the same sightlines. To demonstrate the extended method, we apply it in the analysis of CanariCam multi-wavelength imaging polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula, W3 IRS5, and W51 IRS2, and also spectropolarimetry of W3 IRS5. We compare these results with those obtained with the original Aitken method and show that the Egg Nebula observations are fit better when this third component is incorporated into the analysis. Polarimetry observations of W3 IRS5 are also fit better with the extended Aitken method, but the original method suffices to fit many sightlines. Observations of W51 IRS2 are fit well by either the original or extended Aitken method. Including scattering by dust in the decomposition of polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula and W3 IRS5 produces better results for the emissive and absorptive components, and in particular for the position angle (PA) of those components. The distribution of the difference between absorptive and emissive PA is then found to be more peaked at a single angle, nearly perpendicular. This supports the theory that mid-IR polarization arises from elongated dust grains aligned along magnetic field lines, since then the PA of emissive and absorptive polarization would be perpendicular. When significant scattering is not present the extended method produces the same results as the original method.",

A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, & Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$.

We estimate their disk accretion efficiency and model their spectral energy distribution (SED) in terms of lepto-hadronic emission, gaining information respectively on the potential similarity of their environment with that of TXS 0506+056 and on their neutrino flux and detectability prospects at TeV energies. Our study shows the candidates' high energy emission to be dominated by leptonic processes. Part of them also show a high accretion rate, characteristic of FSRQs.

    "abstract": "We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1<z<2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \\pm 0.79)[{\\rm km\\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\\sigma_8=0.841 \\pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.",

In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity.

    "abstract": "We study the influence of fuzzy-dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV} \\leq m_a \\leq 5.4\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV}$ at $2\\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.",

    "abstract": "The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Positive-Definite Covariance Network (PD-CovNet) to simulate the full $33 \\times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously published $15 \\times 15$ covariance matrix. Hyperparameters are chosen via leave-one-z-out validation, and performance is benchmarked against a Gaussian-process (GP) baseline. Under identical five-fold cross-validation over redshift groups, we prove that PD-CovNet is a reliable generator of the full covariance compared to the GP baseline. Using this full PD-CovNet-simulated covariance alongside three comparators with different covariance specifications, we constrain $\\mathrm{H}_0$ with two independent methods (EMCEE and GP). Across all covariance specifications and both constraint methods, standardized differences and two-sided p-values show no statistically meaningful shift in the central value of the constrained $\\mathrm{H}_0$. However, the precision of the constrained $\\mathrm{H}_0$ depends on both covariance and method: EMCEE is uniformly more precise than GP once covariance is modeled; within a fixed method, incorporating more covariance reduces precision; and PD-CovNet hyperparameters have a modest effect on uncertainty. These results indicate the importance of accurate covariance modeling in CC-based $\\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.",

However, the high dimensionality of orbital parameters and observational constraints present significant challenges in statistically characterizing their properties. In this study, we propose and implement a novel algorithm, the Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution (DVCD), to analyze binary star systems using radial velocity data. The DVCD method demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, reducing computation time by factors of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ under comparable conditions. We applied the DVCD algorithm to red giant samples from APOGEE DR16, dividing the dataset into 16 subsets based on $\\log g$ and M/H. Our findings reveal that the binary fraction decreases with decreasing surface gravity and increasing metallicity, offering valuable constraints on the evolutionary processes of binary stars. This study underscores the potential of the DVCD method for large-scale statistical analyzes of binary systems.",

    "abstract": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-$z$ accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-$z$ accuracy for $z < 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \\sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.",

    "abstract": "KELT-20b is a well-studied ($T_{\\text{eq}}=2262$ K) ultra hot Jupiter, but its multidimensional atmospheric structure remains unconstrained. We performed high-resolution cross-correlation transmission spectroscopy (HRCCTS) on a single transit time series of KELT-20b, observed with PEPSI on the LBT. Upon combining nineteen in-transit exposures, we detect Fe I $(11.9\\sigma)$ and Fe II $(23.7\\sigma)$ and tentatively detect Na I $(3.4\\sigma)$ and Cr I $(3.3\\sigma)$. The full-transit velocity offsets of the strongest absorbers are $\\Delta V_{\\text{Fe I}} = -1.0 \\pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\\Delta V_{\\text{Fe II}}= 0.0\\pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$, which are mostly inconsistent with previously published values for KELT-20b, although the previous measurements are mostly inconsistent with each other. By correcting for discrepant systemic velocity solutions of up to $1.7$ km s$^{-1}$ between studies, our Fe II offset becomes consistent with previous measurements ($\\leq 1.7\\sigma$), while Fe I remains significantly less blueshifted than in earlier studies ($ \\geq 2.2-4.5\\sigma$). We propose a set of detection criteria to improve future reproducibility in HRCCTS work. Phase-resolving the Fe I and Fe II absorption signatures into eight orbital phase bins reveals distinct dynamical regimes: Fe II exhibits a strong phase-dependent blueshift from ingress to egress along with significant limb asymmetry, while Fe I shows weaker signals and a more modest blueshift with phase. These patterns indicate day-to-night winds and suggest scale height differences are a significant driver of limb asymmetry in KELT-20b.",

These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude.

We developed a unified framework to interpret both the observed energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy. In this work, we explore the influence of the Sun's motion relative to the local plasma frame - the Compton-Getting (CG) effect - on the anisotropy. We find that incorporating the CG effect could slightly reduce the dipole amplitude and shift the phase away from the direction of the local regular magnetic field at tens of TeV. At lower energies, where the anisotropy from the cosmic-ray density gradient is weak, the Sun's relative motion becomes more prominent. Below $\\sim 200$ GeV, the dipole amplitude increases again, approaching the value expected from the CG effect. Additionally, a phase flip is observed at a few hundred GeV, aligning with the CG direction. Future anisotropy measurements from $100$ GeV to TeV energies could serve as a critical test of this effect.",

    "abstract": "Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\\times 10^{-2}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking \"primordial black holes\" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.",

    "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.",

    "abstract": "We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \\gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated. Note however that we have only considered the two-body merger channel in this work; a more thorough analysis of our scenario will require a study on the dynamics involved in the three-body merger channel for broad mass distributions, which we leave to future work.",

    "abstract": "Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.",

    "abstract": "We present a broad-line AGN at z=5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)=7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm dyn}/M_\\odot)=9.1$ suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas and has three neighbours: a satellite galaxy, a possible satellite/gas cloud and a tentatively detected spatially detached outflow. H$\\alpha$ shows strong absorption, deeper than the continuum, thus ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v=-13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\\sigma$=120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.",

The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of PMFs $n_{\\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\\lesssim n_{\\rm B}\\lesssim4$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\\lesssim0.5$ nG.

    "title": "A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography",
    "abstract": "Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",

    "abstract": "Proto-planetary disks display the so-called size-luminosity relation, where their mm-wavelength fluxes scale linearly with their emitting areas. This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the \"bouncing barrier\" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of 100 micron. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \\le 60^\\circ$, $10^\\circ \\le |b| \\le 60^\\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\\chi \\sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\\langle \\sigma \\upsilon \\rangle \\sim$ (5-8)$\\times 10^{-25} \\ \\rm cm^3 \\, s^{-1}$ for the $b\\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.",

We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.",

In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\\sim 5\\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",

Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.",

    "title": "Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities",
    "abstract": "When 3D relative displacement $\\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $>3.7\\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

    "abstract": "The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M > 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\\citet{2017A&A...602A.100T} and \\citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\\sim360~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\\odot$ to $\\sim693~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.",

    "abstract": "We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

    "abstract": "Ly$\\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in angle-averaged radial surface brightness profile. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations",

    "abstract": "Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.",

    "abstract": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $\\delta B/B_0\\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

    "title": "Stellar Feedback Effects on the Mass Distribution of Clouds and Cloud Complexes",
    "abstract": "Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\\ 10^{1.5},\\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)",

    "abstract": "The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often attributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with simplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has been shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in planet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their exploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of gap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging from locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling recipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of radiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform hydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular momentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We repeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally isothermal, adiabatic, local beta cooling, and fully radiative including radiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential physics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full radiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the trends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap opening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical flows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two approaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage the use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk interaction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling prescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly important in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive disk regions (>10 au).",

    "abstract": "During cosmic noon ($z\\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained challenging due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55\"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42\"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\\pm0.1)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\\pm0.2)\\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\\Delta V$: shorter transfers require higher insertion $\\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\\Delta V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$.

We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \\pm 0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses of $4.8\\times 10^3\\ M_{\\odot}$ and $3.5\\times 10^3\\ M_{\\odot}$, respectively, and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar medium are discussed.",

    "title": "Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks",
    "abstract": "Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.",

By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. We adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection for mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce an alternative method of mitigating the `deprojection bias' - the loss of modes induced by deprojection - employing simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\\ell \\lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After removing the bias in the shot noise and correcting for the remaining mode loss using a transfer function, our formalism produces unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and show it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the public code NaMaster.",

    "title": "Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation",
    "abstract": "Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{a\\gamma} = 1.685 \\times 10^{-10},\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \\times 10^{-8},\\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.",

    "title": "StarDICE IV: correcting visible photometry from atmospheric gray extinction using thermal infrared observations",
    "abstract": "Next-generation ground-based surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time require photometric calibration that is both long-term stable and spatially uniform at the sub-percent level, even during non-photometric conditions. Achieving this precision motivates new approaches to characterize atmospheric transmission, particularly to mitigate gray extinction from clouds. The StarDICE experiment aims to establish a metrology chain linking laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes with 1 mmag accuracy in the $\\textit{griz}$ bands, a goal for which controlling variable atmospheric effects is essential. We present a method that corrects photometric measurements using simultaneous radiometric information from an infrared thermal camera. The gray-extinction model is fit on an image-by-image basis using thermal radiance excess and the difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars, without requiring assumptions about the spatial structure of extinction. The method relies on a forward model that incorporates environmental monitoring, radiative-transfer simulations, and Gaia DR3 stellar catalogs. Using data from a remote observing system that repeatedly monitored two fields under diverse atmospheric conditions, we show that the corrections reduce residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes and produce extinction maps with 2-arcmin resolution and $\\sim$0.01 mag accuracy. Using this technique, we can recover data acquired under non-photometric conditions with a precision comparable to data obtained under photometric conditions. For the most affected exposures, the mean absolute error improves from 0.64 to 0.11 mag, and temporal extinction variations can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source. We discuss the implications of this technique for future surveys and outline directions for further refinement.",

    "title": "Exoplanet climate characterization with transit asymmetries -- A comprehensive population study from the optical to the infrared",
    "abstract": "Space missions (CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO) facilitate detailed characterization of exoplanets. This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1~$\\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5~$\\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\\lambda > 2\\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences > +500 ppm for 8-10 $\\mu$m.",

    "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^-12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.",

    "title": "Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Hunting for luminous z > 6 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Fields -- forecasts and first bright detections",
    "abstract": "The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.",

    "abstract": "We report observations of Type Ia SN 2021hem, located in an apparently hostless environment. With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\\pm0.09 M_\\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\\mu_{lim,r} = 26.3\\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible AGN host galaxy, at a distance of 104 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\\sim$2200 km/s by AGN interaction. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.",

    "abstract": "Lensed gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new window into the study of dark matter substructures, yet the faint interference signatures they produce are buried in detector noise. To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.",

    "title": "ODIN: Characterizing the Three-dimensional Structure of Two Protocluster Complexes at $z = 3.1$",
    "abstract": "We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster 'complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.",

    "abstract": "Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.",

    "title": "Accounting for the Known Unknowns: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation",
    "abstract": "The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package \"pycbc_wferrors_plugin\", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores radial and non-radial oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) as they evolve from hot, neutrino-rich configurations through deleptonization to cold, catalyzed states. The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and the full General Relativistic framework. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error in the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\\tilde{\\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing the interiors of PNSs and constraining the EoS of dense matter.",

Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g., during the QCD phase transition.

Considering examples with de\\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands\"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.",

These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description.

    "abstract": "While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form.

However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.",

In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.",

    "abstract": "Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.",

    "abstract": "The coupled entropy is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be equivalent to the density at the scale for scale-shape distributions. Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination.",

    "abstract": "The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.",

    "abstract": "Impacted with sufficiently large stress, a dense, initially liquid-like suspension can be forced into a solid-like state through the process of shear jamming. While the onset of shear jamming has been investigated extensively, less is known about the resulting solid-like state in the high stress limit and its failure. We experimentally produce such high-stress failure by impacting dense suspensions at a controlled speed. Using cornstarch suspensions we vary impact speed over several orders of magnitude and change fluid viscosity and surface tension in order to identify the conditions for failure. The results are compared with dense suspensions of potato starch or silica particles. In the case of fracture, we observe two types of cracks: a primary circular crack around the impactor followed by secondary radial cracks. Mapping out the onset of radial fracturing for different volume fractions and impact speeds, we identify the requirements for failure via crack formation to occur with at least 50% likelihood. We find that this likelihood is not sensitive to changes in particle diameter, but increases when the solvent's viscosity or surface tension are reduced. In the state diagram for dense suspensions we delineate the upper limit of shear-jammed rigidity and the crossover into a fracture regime at large volume fraction and normal stress, several orders of magnitude above the onset stress for shear-jamming. We find that the onset of fracturing in many cases is correlated with internal ductile deformation of the shear-jammed material underneath the impactor, observable in normal stress as a function of axial strain. For small suspension volumes and large impact speeds, we find strain-hardening up until fracturing. This more brittle behavior results in a modulus that, just before crack formation, is an order of magnitude larger than in shear-jammed suspensions undergoing ductile deformation.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize.",

Here, we report the study of 50 self-propelled oil droplets floating on the surface of an aqueous solution. 25 droplets are stained with a red dye, and the other 25 are stained blue: the colorants affect the droplets' interfacial tension properties differently, consequently influencing their collective dynamics. Droplet trajectories extending for up to 5 hours are extracted from video recordings with a tracking pipeline developed ad hoc. The structural and dynamical analysis of the system reveals a ``life-to-death'' cycle unfolding in qualitatively distinct stages, showcasing a complex interplay between individual droplet mobility and collective organization. The tools developed and the results obtained in our work pave the way to the in silico modelling as well as the experimental design of synthetic active matter systems displaying life-like and programmable behavior.",

We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds.

Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not exclusive to turbulence. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Block copolymer (BCP) melts play a critical role in the design of thermoplastics, owing in large part to the creation of alternating nano-scale domains of soft and stiff components. Much of thermoplastic design has been focused on the short-time response associated with the dynamical rigidity of rubbery or glassy chains. However, less attention has been paid to the long-time relaxation and rigidity of microphase separated BCP melts or the role that domain morphology plays in modulating near-equilibrium response. We take advantage of the ability of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to calculate equilibrium properties of BCP melts to explore the anisotropic elastic response of ordered ABA and AB copolymer melts as quasistatic deformation processes. This allows us to determine the anisotropic stiffness of the liquid crystal-like lamellar and columnar phases due to modulations in domain spacing, as well as the full stiffness tensor of the cubic BCC sphere and double gyroid phases. We explore elastic modulus landscapes for both single grain materials and random polycrystals over architectural parameters and segregation strengths, using AB diblock and ABA triblock melts as key examples. Finally, we re-examine basic assumptions of BCP melts as simple composites, dependence of melt stiffness on domain spacing, and the role of bridging chain conformations in altering melt relaxation, providing evidence for an interplay between mass transport and domain topology that remains to be understood.",

    "abstract": "Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.",

Here, we report a theoretical investigation of the microscopic origin of the slowdown in amorphous silica, a prototypical strong glass former with a tetrahedral network structure. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze atomic jump dynamics, the elementary structural change processes underlying relaxation. We find that the jump statistics deviate from Poisson behavior with decreasing temperature, reflecting the emergence of dynamic disorder in which slowly evolving variables modulate the jump motion. The slowdown is species-dependent: for silicon, the primary constraint arises from the fourth-nearest oxygen neighbor, while at lower temperatures, the fourth-nearest silicon also becomes relevant; for oxygen, the dominant influence comes from the second-nearest silicon neighbors. As the system is cooled, the jump dynamics become increasingly slow and intermittent, proceeding in a higher-dimensional space of multiple slow variables that reflect cooperative rearrangements of the network. Species-resolved point-to-set correlations further reveal that the spatial extent of cooperative relaxation grows differently for silicon and oxygen, directly linking their relaxation asymmetry to the extent of collective motion. Together, these results provide a microscopic framework linking dynamic disorder, species-dependent constraints, and cooperative correlations, offering deeper insight into the slowdown of strong glass-forming networks.",

    "abstract": "In materials discovery, the integration of first-principles calculations with machine learning techniques has been actively studied for two key tasks: crystal structure prediction, which searches for stable structures given a chemical composition, and elemental substitution, which explores chemical compositions that yield desirable properties in a given crystal structure. However, even when both the crystal structure and chemical composition are fixed, material properties can still vary depending on the atomic arrangements (configurations) at crystallographic sites. To support detailed material design, we present PyAPX, a Python toolkit that performs Bayesian searches of stable atomic configurations. A distinctive feature of this initial release is the introduction of encoding methods suitable for configuration search, and we evaluate their performance using the h-BCN system. As a result, they were confirmed to yield superior convergence compared to commonly used one-hot encoding. PyAPX is broadly applicable to crystalline materials and is expected to further advance materials discovery.",

In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.",

In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates.",

    "abstract": "Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.",

In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2{\\Delta}/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 < $x$ <= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.",

While well understood for passive systems, how this process is regulated by active agents such as motile bacteria remains largely unexplored. By combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a prototypical dextran-polyethylene glycol ATPS with hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the interplay between bacterial activity and interfacial wetting gives rise to a robust sequence of nonequilibrium morphologies, including self-spinning droplets, elongated droplet chains, branched capillary-like clusters, and highly deformed droplets. We find that activity plays a dual role in coarsening kinetics: it suppresses coarsening through hydrodynamically driven, activity-induced droplet rotation, yet accelerates it when dextran is the minority phase, where wetting-mediated attraction governs bacterial aggregation. These findings reveal a generic physical mechanism through which motility and wetting cooperatively control phase-separation dynamics, offering new physical insight into activity-regulated LLPS and suggesting strategies for engineering ATPS morphology using active agents.",

In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits.",

    "abstract": "Materials, at their essence, are networks defined by homogeneity: uniform bonds, fixed thicknesses, and discrete length scales. Mechanical metamaterials, while representing structurally more diverse microstructures, remain defined by the homogeneity of their unit cells, pore sizes, or repeating features. In contrast, as network science has revealed, real-world and biological systems -- from the Internet to the brain -- derive their function from broad, multiscale variability in connectivity and link length. Here, we introduce Scale-Rich (SR) metamaterials, a design framework that embeds network heterogeneity into mechanical metamaterials, achieving order-of-magnitude heterogeneity in ligament lengths, thicknesses, and connectivity. Governed by only two parameters, SR networks span orders of magnitude in structural features, overcoming prior constraints in metamaterial design. Translating these network models into physically realizable materials, we use simulations and experiments to show that SR metamaterials exhibit properties inaccessible to traditional single-scale systems, including highly tunable elastic anisotropy, delocalized nonlinear deformation with high energy absorption, and programmable acoustic wave control. This network-science-based paradigm establishes a minimal yet universal framework for engineering multifunctional materials whose mechanical and acoustic behavior emerge directly from scale diversity itself.",

    "abstract": "While true phase transitions are forbidden in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions, several models have recently been shown to exhibit sharp yet analytic thermodynamic anomalies that mimic thermal phase transitions. We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix.",

Our devices achieve a switching energy of only 3.5 fJ per bit for nanoscale MTJs operating in the sub-nanosecond regime, while maintaining a TMR ratio up to 160 percent after 400 C post-annealing.

However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate.",

    "abstract": "A fundamentally intriguing yet not well understood topic in the field of ferroelectrics is the collective excitation of domain walls (DWs), with potential applications to DW-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Here we use dynamical phase-field simulations to identify the collective modes of an Ising-type $180^{\\circ}$ DW in a uniaxially strained BaTiO3 membrane. The membrane concurrently functions as a cavity for polarization and acoustic waves and permits cavity-enhanced resonant excitation of polarization waves. The simulation reveals an unconventional DW sliding mode that exhibits a depolarization-field-driven nonzero resonant frequency and a dynamically changing internal structure during sliding. These features differ from the previously reported DW sliding modes that have a zero resonant frequency or a rigid internal structure. An analytical model is developed to quantitatively understand the origin of this new DW mode and predict the effect of strain on the mode frequency. The analytically predicted strain dependence of the frequencies of the unconventional DW sliding mode and the DW breathing mode, both in the terahertz regime, is further validated by dynamical phase-field simulations. These results provide new insights into the high-frequency dynamics of ferroelectric DWs and suggest opportunities for realizing on-demand control of phonon-DW resonance by strain, and more broadly, discovering and controlling unconventional DW modes in conventional domain patterns, with applications to reconfigurable THz and optical devices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate the real-space Chern number in a supercell framework. In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states.",

This two-parameter family interpolates continuously between short-range Anderson-like disorder, correlated disorder with conventional hopping, and long-range hopping models with nontrivial delocalization tendencies. Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we construct a comprehensive phase map in the $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ plane by combining spectral statistics, density-of-states analysis, and energy-resolved localization indicators such as the participation ratio, single-particle entanglement entropy, level-spacing ratio $r$, and the ratio of the geometric to arithmetic density of states. From these observables we define phase-indicator functions that compactly quantify localization behaviour across the spectrum. Our analysis reveals robust mobility edges and multiple regimes of spectral coexistence between localized, extended, resonant, and critical states. Finite-size scaling, implemented via an explicit smoothness-based cost function, enables extraction of critical exponents and delineation of transition lines across the $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ parameter space. To validate and complement these physics-based diagnostics, we employ a supervised autoencoder that learns high-level representations of eigenstate structure directly from raw features and reliably reproduces the phase classification defined by the indicator functions. Together, these approaches provide a coherent and internally consistent picture of the spectral transitions driven by correlated disorder and long-range hopping, establishing a unified framework for characterizing mobility edges in long-range one-dimensional systems.",

Recent theoretical studies, however, have demonstrated the existence of topological phases in quasicrystals that are absent in crystals. Despite numerous experimental observations of topological phases in various crystalline systems, observing these phases without crystalline counterparts remains challenging due to very complex models. Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal. Our work represents the first experimental observation of topological phases in quasicrystals without crystalline counterparts, paving the way for the study of exotic topological physics in quasicrystals.",

Using a Laplace-transform moment hierarchy, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean velocity, velocity-orientation projections, velocity autocorrelation, mean-squared velocity, mean-squared displacement, and the fourth moment of velocity. These results agree quantitatively with simulations over all masses, activities, and chiralities. We show that the velocity autocorrelation factorizes into an inertial envelope and a chiral envelope. Despite rich transients in the velocity sector, the long-time positional diffusion equals the overdamped cABP value, independent of mass. From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector. A narrow positive-kurtosis window emerges at large mass and intermediate chirality, with analytic boundaries consistent with the heavy-mass asymptote.",

    "abstract": "Two-terminal spintronic devices remain challenging to model under realistic operating conditions, where the interplay of complex electronic structures, correlation effects and bias-driven non-equilibrium dynamics may significantly impact charge and spin transport. Existing {\\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments.",

Although current-induced magnetic moment accumulation is crucial both for fundamental understanding and practical applications, direct quantifications are scarce. Optical polarization measurements, namely magneto-optical Kerr rotation (MOKE) ($\\theta_K$), have been used to get direct evidence of magnetic accumulation perpendicular to a current flow density ($J$) in late transition metals (Pt) as well as in light transition elements (Ti, Cr), and used to conclude evidence of spin or orbital momentum accumulation. However, discrepancies of the reported $\\theta_K/J$ values, exceeding one order of magnitude, together with early claims that conventional MOKE experiments were not a suitable tool, is prompting revisions of methods and results. Here, we report on a new methodology for MOKE measurements that solves known bottlenecks.

Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations.",

While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for Lévy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that Lévy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak Lévy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties.",

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis.

Combining scaling arguments with analytic derivations and numerical analysis, we adapt the renormalization-group equations originally developed for the Efimov effect in a two-dimensional conformally invariant potential to the case of diffusion in $\\mathbb{H}^2$, thereby deriving the BKT-type divergence of the correlation length. We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution.

    "abstract": "The single-layered perovskite Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, characterized by a 4$d^4$ electron configuration, has been studied from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation, with inclusion of strong on-site Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SO+$U$), in the framework of the fully relativistic, spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) band-structure method. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials.",

    "abstract": "Electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field is a key property of polar materials, but the standard interpolation-based ab initio approach to compute polarization differences within the modern theory of polarization presents challenges for automated high-throughput calculations. Berry flux diagonalization [J. Bonini et. al, Phys. Rev. B 102, 045141 (2020)] has been proposed as an efficient and reliable alternative, though it has yet to be widely deployed. Here, we assess Berry flux diagonalization using ab initio calculations of a large set of materials, introducing and validating heuristics that ensure branch alignment with a minimal number of intermediate interpolated structures. Our automated implementation of Berry flux diagonalization succeeds in cases where prior interpolation-based workflows fail due to band-gap closures or branch ambiguities. Benchmarking with ab initio calculations of 176 candidate ferroelectrics, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a broad range of insulating materials and obtain accurate effective polarization values with fewer interpolated structures than prior automated interpolation-based workflows. Our real-space heuristics that can predict gauge stability a priori from ionic displacements enable a general automated framework for reliable polarization calculations and efficient high-throughput screening of chemically and structurally diverse polar insulators. These results establish Berry flux diagonalization as a robust and efficient method to compute the effective polarization of solids and to accelerate the data-driven discovery of functional polar materials.",

By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudo-transition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudo-critical features in one dimension.",

For $t'\\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying complexity in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge, and many proposed measures fail to capture the structural features that intuitive or theoretical considerations would demand. Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems.",

    "abstract": "In crystalline solids, the electronic polarization follows the \\emph{generalized Neumann's principle}, under which all crystallographic point groups can, in principle, support ferroelectric polarization. However, in high-symmetry structures, polarization is constrained by symmetry operations and becomes quantized into discrete values. We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \\emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch. By establishing QP as a fundamental bulk invariant, our work uncovers a universal mechanism governing interfacial electronic phenomena and opens new pathways for the design of functional quantum materials through engineered polarization mismatch.",

    "abstract": "Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom.",

    "abstract": "High overtone bulk acoustic resonators are essential components in microwave signal processing and emerging quantum technologies; however, conventional designs suffer from limited impedance matching, spurious mode interference, and restricted scalability. Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters. These combined features give X HTBAR devices excellent integration compatibility and strong immunity to electrode related perturbations, making them promising multimode phonon sources for large scale quantum interconnects and microwave photonic integrated circuits.",

Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2.

The beads are self-propelled in this medium by means of self-thermophoresis resulting from local heating as a result of light absorption by their carbon cap. Within a certain laser power range, we find that these particles exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional active motion near a solid surface with stochastic rotational reversals when propelling themselves away from the region of maximum intensity, which leads to a stable trapping with oscillatory-like behavior inside the illuminated region. The orientation autocorrelation function of this type of confined active motion displays damped oscillations whose characteristic frequency increases with increasing propulsion speed, thus resulting in four regimes of translational motion depending on the observation time scale: thermal diffusion, ballistic motion, oscillatory behavior, and confinement. Our experimental findings are well described by a minimal phenomenological model that includes the nonlinear effect of a torque that reorients the particle toward the center of the optical confinement, which in combination with rotational diffusion gives rise to the observed orientational changes that allow their oscillatory trapping inside the light field. We also show that a similar active trapping mechanism emerges in the case of Janus colloidal rods, even though the periodicity is hindered by their three-dimensional rotation in the laser beam.",

Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this view. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher-temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a non-differentiable point at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a fundamental change in the structure factor's realizability, even though the structure factor itself only changes slightly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.",

These distinct classes are selected by conservation laws and slow hydrodynamic modes.",

    "title": "Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling",
    "abstract": "Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.",

    "abstract": "We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.",

    "abstract": "Ternary compounds obtained by alloying wurtzite AlN with transition metals have emerged as promising materials with significantly enhanced piezoelectric characteristics relative to binary AlN. The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \\leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N. Building on this finding, we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N GHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that exhibit enhanced performance, as well as efficient excitation of bulk acoustic waves with low propagation losses. These results establish Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N as a promising platform for next-generation high-frequency electromechanical devices, with prospects for further piezoelectric enhancements through improved epitaxy.",

    "abstract": "Optical control offers a compelling route for tailoring material properties on an ultrafast time scale. Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour.",

Such $\\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs can be used for superconducting memory and logic circuit applications. Here we present the results of theoretical calculation of the current-phase relationship (CPR), exhibiting the Josephson diode effect and $\\varphi_0\\neq 0,\\pi$, for a JJ through a specific magnetic material. As the interlayer of the JJ we consider an ultra-thin film of intermetallic lanthanide ($Ln$)-based compound $\\mathrm{GdIr_2Si_2}$. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) methods and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the film, construct the effective tight-binding Hamiltonian, perfectly describing its electronic properties, and calculate CPR. The CPRs demonstrate a pronounced $\\varphi_0$ of the order of unity and a pronounced Josephson diode effect with the diode efficiency $ \\lesssim 0.3$. Moreover, the efficiency can be controlled via rotation of in-plane magnetization in the interlayer.

Our findings demonstrate that, although the body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure is thermodynamically stable at equilibrium for small particle sizes, the deposition process induces a crystal-to-crystal phase transition into the more stable wurtzite (WRZ) phase. This transformation is facilitated by a specific redistribution of the nanoparticle ions, which effectively compensates the emerging polar facets at the moment of transition.

While ferroelectric epitaxial thin films have been studied as transferred membranes on flexible substrates, the degree of control over membrane curvature and local polarization remains limited, being tied to spontaneous fold patterns or uniaxial mechanical deformations. To address this challenge, we introduce a versatile, high-precision optical method for engineering the bending and associated polarization landscapes in ferroelectric membranes. Our approach, based on a photosensitive polymer-assisted patterning technique, enables the creation of on-demand bending strain patterns at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate deterministic 90° and 180° polarization rotations in a ferroelectric BaTiO3 membrane, driven by in-plane strain and flexoelectric effects associated with strain gradients respectively. Such a patterning method is compatible with any oxide membrane, providing a versatile platform for studying strain dependent domain architectures, designing custom ferroelectric landscapes, and investigating flexoelectric behavior with unprecedented control capabilities.",

Remarkably, superconductivity can be counterintuitively enhanced by temperature when the Zeeman energy exceeds the superconducting order parameter, owing to the competition between thermal and magnetic effects. We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model. A detailed parameter analysis identifies the conditions under which this phenomenon emerges, suggesting that temperature-enhanced superconductivity may be observable in materials such as MgB2 and FeSe through transport and tunneling measurements.",

It was discovered that each dome is accompanied by a distinct nematic quantum critical point (QCP): one associated with a pure nematic QCP, and the other with a nematic QCP entangled with antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe.

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles.",

    "abstract": "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) directly probes the energy and momentum of electrons in quantum materials, but conventional setups capture only a small fraction of the full 2$\\pi$ solid angle. This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$\\pi$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range.",

    "abstract": "Large chemical tunability and strong light-matter interactions make colloidal transi- tion metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanostructures particularly suitable for light-emitting applications. However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombina- tion, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the phase diagrams of the Yaldram and Khan catalytic surface model on square and hexagonal lattices when exchange diffusion is allowed for carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N) atoms. To reach our goal, we carried out steady-state Monte Carlo (MC) simulations over $4\\times 10^5$ points, for both lattices, in order to obtain a framework of the steady reactive state of the model for different values of the nitric oxide dissociation rate, $r_{NO}$. The results show the emergence of steady reactive state for certain values of $r_{NO}$ and of exchange diffusion rate $x$ when the simulations take place on square lattices. Our findings on the hexagonal lattice also show that the diffusion of these species favors the appearance of the active phase for values of $r_{NO}$ lower than that found for the standard model. In addition, we observed that the system possesses a continuous phase transition and a discontinuous one separating the active phase from absorbing states for both lattices, except for $r_{NO}=1$ in which the continuous phase transition is destroyed and a steady reactive state emerges from the beginning since very small values of $x$.",

    "abstract": "We report the observation of a phonon bottleneck effect impacting the thermal depopulation of photoexcited shallow defects in high-resistivity silicon. Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications.",

In this work, we study infinite temperature spin diffusion in a classical integrable, space-time discrete version of anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz magnet in the easy-axis regime, subjected to integrability-breaking perturbations. Our numerical results based on large-scale simulations reveal i) a sharp change in the spin diffusion constant as a function of perturbation strength in the thermodynamic limit and ii) a crossover from non-Gaussian to Gaussian statistics of magnetization transfer reflected in higher order cumulants under integrability breaking.

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the impact of formamidinium bromide (FABr) over-stoichiometry in the precursor solution on the optoelectronic properties and morphology of the resulting films of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr_3). Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Locally probing pairing in fermionic superfluids, ranging from micro- to macroscopic scales, has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter.",

The obtained energies are compared with numerical values found by applying the variational approach utilizing the universal Gaussian basis. It is found that the wave functions of the ground and higher-energy states for systems with quartic dispersion have nodes in the classically forbidden region. Thus, the well-known oscillation theorem for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is not, in general, applicable for systems with quartic dispersion. Still it is observed that the oscillation theorem holds in the classically allowed region in all considered examples. The properties of bound state wave functions are compared with the solutions of the exactly solvable problem of a square well potential.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.",

In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile.",

    "abstract": "Layered \"mosaic\" metal-halide perovskite materials display a wide-variety of microstructures that span the order-disorder spectrum and can be tuned via the composition of their constituent B-site octahedral species. Such materials are typically modeled using computationally expensive ab initio methods, but these approaches are greatly limited to small sample sizes. Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed. In summary, our packing model and mixing metric enable one to accurately explore the enormous space of hypothetical layered mosaic alloy compositions and identify materials with potentially desirable optoelectronic and magnetic properties.",

Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions.

While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics.",

In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest.

    "title": "E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays",
    "abstract": "Coherent crystalline interfaces form when a pair of joined crystals share lattice sites. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing topological phases for strongly interacting fermions in the mixed-state regime remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles.",

Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement.",

    "abstract": "The real area of contact governs, in part, the friction coefficient, yet its time evolution in rough viscoelastic interfaces remains incompletely understood. In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading.",

The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors.

Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.",

Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.",

They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour.

The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized modes embedded in the spectrum of extended states, typically stabilized by symmetry or interference. While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing.",

We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical context over abstract algorithms, using an accessible web-based platform to ensure zero-install machine learning (ML) workflow development practice and in-class active learning. Assessment combines code-guided homework, literature-based mini-reviews, and collaborative projects in which students build AI-assisted workflows for real experimental problems. Learning gains include increased confidence with Python, molecular property prediction, reaction optimization, and data mining, and improved skills in evaluating AI tools in chemistry. All course materials are openly available, offering a discipline-specific, beginner-accessible framework for integrating AI into synthetic chemistry training.",

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are widely engineered using surface coatings and chemical treatments to improve interfacial bonding and load transfer. It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization.",

We propose a novel framework to model equity and mortgage dynamics in presence of mortgage interest rates, borrowing costs on equity-backed credit lines, and tax shields arising from interest deductibility. The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.",

It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene.

At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.",

The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization.",

Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.",

This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported.

We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs.

Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement.",

In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\\sim 200$, to strongly $\\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c< 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating.

    "title": "PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.",

We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.",

    "abstract": "Crystalline symmetry can be used to predict bulk and surface properties of topological phases. For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry.",

Recent developments with quantum simulators have unveiled strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in a non-electronic system of strongly interacting fermions was not achieved to date. Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a cold-atom analogue of a solid-state Hall bar and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analogue quantum simulations and measurements performed in solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.",

Here, we show that the involvement of quantum geometry can characterize more exotic excitonic phases exhibiting physical properties that are not influenced by their topology but by geometry. Starting from a topological band insulator and gradually reducing the band gap, many-body interaction can initially generate a p + ip-wave and then an s-wave excitonic insulator. Interestingly, they bear the same Chern number but exhibit completely different spin textures and magneto-optical Kerr responses, reflecting the intricate geometric distinctions in their wave functions. We also propose to enhance the correlation effect via Floquet engineering, which provides a systematic way to realize these topological excitonic insulators and their phase transitions in the nonequilibrium steady states.

We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. We argue that different superconducting states in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni $3d$ and O $2p$ states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ within the random phase approximation and find a transition between $d$-wave and sign-changing $s$-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Superconductivity in flatband systems has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics. Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system, with a coexistence of Dirac bands and flat bands, for exploring superconductivity. However, the roles of flat bands and dispersive bands played in determining the superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we focus on the alternating twisted quadralayer graphene to reveal unconventional superconducting behaviors by systematically quantifying individual contributions for both the dispersive bands and the flat bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. By analyzing the Landau fan diagram at zero electric displacement fields, we disentangle Dirac bands and flat bands, revealing a Coulomb interaction-induced band broadening effect. We further quantify the electric-field-dependent evolution of the critical temperature and coherence length, and estimate the flat-band Fermi velocity and superfluid stiffness via critical current measurements. Our results demonstrate an electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions mediated by Dirac band hybridization, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional flatband superconductivity in moiré systems.",

    "abstract": "Coherent manipulation of plasmon wavepackets in solid-state systems is crucial for advancing nanoscale electronic devices, offering a unique platform for quantum information processing based on propagating quantum bits. Controlling the eigenstate of plasmon wavepackets is essential, as it determines its propagation speed and hence the number of quantum operations that can be performed during its flight-time through a quantum system. When plasmon wavepackets are generated by short voltage pulses and transmitted through nanoscale devices, they distribute among multiple electron conduction channels via Coulomb interactions, a phenomenon known as charge fractionalisation. This spreading complicates plasmon manipulation in quantum circuits and makes precise control of the eigenstates of plasmon wavepackets challenging. Using a cavity, we demonstrate the ability to isolate and select electron conduction channels contributing to plasmon excitation, thus enabling precise control of plasmon eigenstate. Specifically, we observe an electron-channel blockade effect, where charge fractionalisation into cavity-confined channels is suppressed due to the plasmon's narrow energy distribution, enabling more stable and predictable plasmonic circuits. This technique provides a versatile tool for designing plasmonic circuits, offering the ability to tailor plasmon speed through local parameters, minimise unwanted plasmon excitation in adjacent circuits, and enable the precise selection of electron-channel plasmon eigenstates in quantum interferometers.",

We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the \"strange-metal\" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$, and the gap is found to fill instead of close with increasing temperature.",

We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics.

We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a phase transition from linear to nonlinear information processing in echo state networks, a widely used framework in reservoir computing. The network consists of randomly connected recurrent nodes perturbed by a noise and the output is obtained through linear regression on the network states. By varying the standard deviation of the input weights, we systematically control the nonlinearity of the network. For small input standard deviations, the network operates in an approximately linear regime, resulting in limited information processing capacity. However, beyond a critical threshold, the capacity increases rapidly, and this increase becomes sharper as the network size grows. Our results indicate the presence of a discontinuous transition in the limit of infinitely many nodes. This transition is fundamentally different from the conventional order-to-chaos transition in neural networks, which typically leads to a loss of long-term predictability and a decline in the information processing capacity. Furthermore, we establish a scaling law relating the critical nonlinearity to the noise intensity, which implies that the critical nonlinearity vanishes in the absence of noise.",

Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.",

    "abstract": "Metal hydrides are promising solid-state carriers for the integrated hydrogen economy, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality. However, their conventional synthesis relies on external sources of high-purity H2, thereby linking storage directly to energy-intensive production processes. Here, we transform this paradigm by introducing an acid-mediated \"controllable hydrogen embrittlement\" strategy for the direct and efficient synthesis and functionalization of metal hydrides under mild conditions. This approach leverages in situ hydrogen generation and defect engineering during the reaction of bulk metals with acid, enabling the preparation of over 20 high-purity hydrides. Using diamond anvil cell experiments, we establish a quantitative criterion, |Delta Peq| > Delta Pph, which reveals the key mechanism governing hydride formation and stability, and guides the synthesis of challenging targets such as LiH. This method not only significantly lowers the energy footprint and economic cost of hydride synthesis by eliminating the need for high-pressure H2 and enabling the use of renewable feedstocks but also creates defect-rich, active hydrides. As a demonstration, an engineered titanium hydride achieves an outstanding current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for NH3 in the nitrate electroreduction reaction, while maintaining consistently high performance across a wide operating window, showcasing the stability conferred by enhanced H- transport. This work redefines hydrogen embrittlement as a powerful tool for synthesis and functionalization, establishing a material platform that integrates hydrogen capture, storage, and conversion, and thereby opening a novel pathway to unify the fragmented hydrogen energy chain.",

In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.",

For $d$-, $g$- and $i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models.

While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the nearest-neighbor tunneling excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.",

Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\\ast} = 1.59 \\pm 0.49~\\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs.

Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type.

However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions. More broadly, our approach will contribute to the development seamless multiscale model and optimization machine learning approaches for material discovery.",

    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.",

However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \\textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.",

    "abstract": "A distinguishing feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the spins of two different bosons are coupled to an odd integer. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two kinds of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel on the ground state (GS) has been studied. It was found that the odd-channel causes two types of fluctuation (a mixing of various components). (i) coherent mixing, where all the components have the same sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair emerging in the spin-state would be smaller; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is repulsive. (ii) cyclic mixing, where half selected components have the + sign while the other half have the - sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair is larger; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is attractive. It was further found that the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the spin of a single species S_X (X=A, B) is no longer conserved. However, its average \\overline{S_X} is well defined. It turns out that S_X and \\overline{S_X} vary with the strengths in a similar way. The former jumps step-by-step from a good quantum number (an even integer) to the next good quantum number, the latter jumps also in a step-by-step way, but from a \"real number\" to another well-separated \"real number\". Exactly speaking, each of these real numbers is not exactly a number but an interval with a very narrow width at the real axis. Thus, the GS can be specified by these real numbers. It was found that, when the strengths of the two intraspecies interactions are not remarkably different, and/or the particle numbers are larger, the widths of the intervals are narrower, the above picture holds more nicely, and the GS can be well-specified by these real numbers.",

Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a $d$-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. The Cooper pair momentum is directly controlled by an externally injected supercurrent providing an experimentally accessible tuning parameter for driving and manipulating the topological FF phase. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same topological FF phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding $45\\%$ without applied magnetic fields. The $d$-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free architecture. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.",

    "title": "A Clarification on Quantum-Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport",
    "abstract": "Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. This work provides a clearer and more unified understanding of the quantum-metric contributions to nonlinear transport. It also establishes a solid foundation for future theoretical developments and experimental explorations in this highly active and rapidly evolving field.",

With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.",

    "abstract": "Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moiré materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moiré band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moiré unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moiré bands from atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moiré bands, as long as the moiré band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moiré Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moiré topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moiré potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moiré topology, and we verify one such combination using a moiré model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By screening the existing 2D material database, we currently identify 92 monolayer materials with (i) the low-energy bands near $\\Gamma$ and (ii) the atomic symmetry data that belong to those combinations. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moiré materials.",

Here, we develop an ab initio framework, grounded in molecular Berry curvature (MBC), that captures electronic-order-driven symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics and is applicable to both insulating and metallic magnets. Using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a model system, we show that the MBC term simultaneously breaks time-reversal and mirror symmetries, enabling a quantitative reproduction of the experimentally observed phonon splittings. The analysis uncovers distinct microscopic origins for the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes: the $E_g$ splitting is governed by MBC and is accurately described by our first-principles scheme, whereas the $E_u$ splitting is enhanced by the Fano resonance, consistent with its asymmetric spectral profile. Leveraging this framework, we further predict several candidates with chiral-phonon splitting. Our results establish a predictive route for identifying and understanding phonon magnetism, chiral phonons, and related Hall-type lattice responses from first principles.",

While crystal morphology due to the distribution and dynamics of the diffusion field has been intensively studied, how the intrinsic material properties affect crystal morphology remains unclear. In this Letter, we demonstrate that higher-order topological phases can give rise to hopper-shaped crystal morphologies through an unconventional mechanism originating from topological electronic states. We quantitatively show this connection by analyzing both the fractal dimension $D_f$ and the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$. When we compare the crystals in the trivial and topological phases with the same $D_{f}$ in the case of relatively rapid crystal growth, the former is in the dendritic shape, while the latter is in the hopper shape, quantified by the smaller $D_{f,c}$ in the topological phase. We reveal the microscopic origin of this anomalous growth in the higher-order topological phase, and find that it leads to the stepwise-depressed morphology characteristic of hopper crystals. Our theory uncovers a fundamental link between hopper crystals and higher-order topological phases, offering unconventional insight into crystal morphology governed by topological electronic states.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.",

This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\\geq 50$ meV within $\\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.",

    "abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.",

    "abstract": "Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moiré flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \\mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\\lbrace \\mathbf{Q}_n \\rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.",

Here, we report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that pins the spin polarization to the crystalline axes: an in-plane electric field along one principal axis drives a fully spin-up charge current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates an equal spin-down current. Consequently, applying an electric field diagonally yields a transverse pure spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. Mechanistically, SADL originates in a distinctive tent state characterized by alternating spin-split flat bands and orthogonal Fermi-surface lines. High-throughput first-principles screening confirms SADL in broad materials (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and a synthesized three-dimensional compound, (BaF)2Mn2Se2O). Our work thus opens a route to ultra-low-power, reconfigurable spintronic devices where the spin states are governed solely by electric field orientation.",

    "abstract": "Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.",

In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.",

This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument.

    "abstract": "In cubic metals, a local, magnetic moment with a triplet ground state coupled to $\\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons can give rise to various non-Fermi liquid (NFL) quantum critical behaviors. To date, only those exchange couplings have been studied that are spherically symmetric already in the high-temperature, local moment regime. Namely, only the effects of potential scattering, dipolar spin exchange, i.e. Kondo, and quadrupolar exchange couplings were considered, and two types of NFL fixed points have been identified. However, in cubic symmetry, six independent exchange couplings can be present in the Hamiltonian: in addition to the spherically symmetric potential scattering and Kondo exchange, there are four independent, spherical-symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian terms: two quadrupolar-quadrupolar, a dipolar-octupolar and a quadrupolar-octupolar exchange interaction, where the first/second element of the compound adjectives refers to the impurity/conduction-electron transitions. While all of them flow to fixed points where rotational invariance is recovered, I found that one of the quadrupolar-quadrupolar couplings flows to a previously unidentified NFL fixed point. I derive the exchange couplings allowed by cubic symmetry, solve them with the numerical renormalization group, and present three types of NFL excitation spectrum$-$one of which is novel, at least in the context of a quantum impurity with a triplet ground state.",

    "title": "Beyond the Lowest Landau Level: Unlocking More Robust Fractional States Using Flat Chern Bands with Higher Vortexability",
    "abstract": "Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moiré flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.",

A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\\alpha$ where $\\alpha\\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.",

    "abstract": "Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here.

These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.",

In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.",

    "abstract": "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal flat bands with Chern number $C$ are commonly understood as color-entangled states constructed from $C$ copies of the lowest Landau level. In realistic moiré systems, however, the band geometry is generally non-ideal, and the mechanism that stabilizes such FCIs remains unclear. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene as a platform, we find two FCIs separated by a continuous transition driven by a geometric instability of the Bloch wave this http URL the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable, and the resulting fractional phase is naturally described by the Halperin-$(112)$ state. Above the transition, the system is geometrically unstable, entering a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of standard quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this unconventional phenomenon, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: in the geometrically unstable regime, interactions hybridize electronic states near the $K$ point and generate an emergent ideal color component that supports the FCI. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a \"color separator,\" directly visualizing the ideal subcomponent in the single-particle level. Together, these results establish mechanisms which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, substantially enlarging their viable parameter space and clarifying the role of quantum geometry in strongly correlated topological phases.",

We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y>2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y<2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y > 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\\,K. All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K. Both the critical temperature for the structural transition and the Curie temperature are moderately suppressed with increasing Pd fraction $y$ and corresponding decreasing Fe fraction $x$, indicating that synthetic control over $x$ and $y$ paves way for the further exploration of these compounds.",

This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of ~13.

We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.

    "abstract": "Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.",

We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.",

Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models.

    "title": "Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?",
    "abstract": "Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.",

    "abstract": "The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.",

In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent and emerging applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.

We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.",

    "title": "Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides",
    "abstract": "Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.",

We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details.

In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have $\\textit{a priori}$ bound for ground state energy. Here, $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\\mathsf{co}$-$\\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption.

    "abstract": "Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.",

Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.",

This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\\pm0.07)\\%$ to $(99.61\\pm0.04)\\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time.

This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.",

    "abstract": "For millennia, humanity has relied exclusively on light$\\unicode{x2014}$initially visible light and, later, broader and broader portions of the electromagnetic spectrum$\\unicode{x2014}$to observe the universe. In the past decade, a remarkable chapter in extending astronomy beyond electromagnetic antennas has been concretized: the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new observational window into the cosmos. Among the many new astronomical sources we may now look for and study through their gravitational-wave signals, the Big Bang is surely among the most fascinating. Gravitational waves give us concrete hope of directly observing the primordial universe, whose light, emitted more than 13.7 billion years ago, is blocked from reaching our telescopes. This dissertation is aimed at the study of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation, the main scientific paradigm for the very early universe. Therefore, the text is divided into chapters on gravitational waves, inflationary cosmology, and inflationary gravitational waves. More specifically, our discussion will be steered by the endeavor to explain how the gravitational-wave signal sought by the NANOGrav observatory could have originated in the primordial universe.",

While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.",

    "abstract": "The first all-sky-all-frequency (ASAF) radiometer search was conducted using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.",

    "abstract": "Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, \"Phase-Modulated-sideband $\\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing\" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.",

These effective geometries replace the Reissner--Nordström singularity with a symmetric transition surface and admit an extremal, cold remnant determined by the minimal area gap in LQG. In turn, we derive the null geodesic equations, investigate the photon effective potential, and obtain expressions for the photon-sphere radius and critical impact parameter. We compute the weak-field deflection angle and Einstein ring size, highlighting the deviations induced by the polymerisation parameter and the Barbero--Immirzi parameter. In the strong-field regime, we compute the strong deflection coefficients $(\\bar{a},\\bar{b})$ and evaluate the lensing observables $\\theta_\\infty$, $s$, and $r_{\\rm mag}$. Unlike the Reissner--Nordström case, the LQG corrections enhance the deflection angle and increase the angular separation of relativistic images, with deviations growing as the geometry approaches the LQG remnant limit. We further compute the corresponding observables for Sgr~A* and M87*, finding that the quantum-gravity modifications lie within the potential sensitivity of next-generation VLBI facilities. For M87*, the angular separation $s\\in(0.05712,0.19123)\\,\\mu\\text{as}$, while it is $s\\in(0.07595,0.25426)\\,\\mu\\text{as}$ for Sgr A*.

Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.",

We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame.

These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes.

The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.",

    "abstract": "We present a complete characterization of stable, off-equatorial circular orbits around magnetically charged black holes (MBHs). For a static, spherically symmetric MBH, we derive an exact analytic expression for the orbital latitude theta as a function of radius r. We establish a direct connection between these orbits and the spacetime fundamental structure, and demonstrate their stability against synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, with potential implications for black hole imaging and polarimetric observations.",

    "abstract": "We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schrödinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $\\Lambda$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.",

    "abstract": "In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",

We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions.

Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.",

By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation.

    "abstract": "By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\\rm g}$ with $t_{\\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\\rm g}$.",

    "abstract": "The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.",

    "abstract": "To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \\textit{i.e.}\\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",

We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly.

    "abstract": "Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.",

As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$.

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.",

    "abstract": "The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package \"pycbc_wferrors_plugin\", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.",

Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.",

Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to explicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of spacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de Sitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh refinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully recovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families of quasinormal modes: complex light ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter modes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the notions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit under consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a destabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\\omega = 0$. Conversely, the branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of discrete modes at $\\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a heuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and highlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut instabilities -- especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational wave signals.

These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description.

The complex scalar field \\psi evolves with time t, and its magnitude on the apparent horizon |\\psi_{h}| starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation in the photon sphere radius r_{ps} is similar to that of the magnitude |\\psi_{h}|. Owing to the emergence of the complex scalar hair \\psi, the apparent horizon radius r_{h} starts increasing sharply and then smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius R_{sh} of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with time t_{o} at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius R_{sh} is larger and also increases as t_{o} increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points t. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the apparent horizon r_{h}, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the photon sphere radius r_{ps}, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. As the variation in r_{ps} is induced by \\psi, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is similarly caused by the change in \\psi. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair \\psi causes the radius R_{sh} of the shadow to start changing.

While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.",

    "abstract": "We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\\bar{R})$, $\\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions. Constraints on the model parameters have also been derived based on cosmological observations.",

In contrast to the fluid particles of this perfect fluid spacetime which follow non-geodesic world-lines and escape to infinity, we prove that freely-falling test particles of McVittie spacetime can reach the black hole horizon in finite proper time. We review the relevant evidence and argue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we consider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological constant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime such that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses the black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The curvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a positive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second order in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame components of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into the black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature terms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this limit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show that there are p.p.\\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge in this limit. We argue that this casts a doubt as to whether or not an extended test body can survive crossing the black hole horizon in this case.",

By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.",

In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.",

However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation.

The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.",

We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise.

For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets.

This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV} \\leq m_a \\leq 5.4\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV}$ at $2\\sigma$.

In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.",

    "title": "A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography",
    "abstract": "Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",

In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the BMS$_3$ highest-weight vacuum character with special value of central charges coincides with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity, up to an overall phase factor ``$i$''. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\\sim 5\\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",

    "abstract": "When 3D relative displacement $\\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $>3.7\\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order.

By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.",

By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely.

Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework.

We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the sensitivity of a future high-luminosity $e^-e^+$ collider operating at $\\sqrt{s}=250~\\text{GeV}$ to CP-violating and CP-conserving anomalous $hVV$ interactions via the Higgsstrahlung process. The effects of new physics are parameterized in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory~(SMEFT) framework through six dimension-6 operators modifying the $hVV$ vertices. Using polarized beams and exploiting polarization and spin correlation asymmetries reconstructed from Higgs decay products, we perform a comprehensive analysis across the three dominant decay modes, $h\\to b\\bar{b}$, $WW^\\star$, and $ZZ^\\star$. The $h\\to WW^\\star$ channel exhibits the highest sensitivity to $\\mathcal{O}_{HW}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{H\\widetilde{W}}$, while the $b\\bar{b}$ mode constrains the remaining operators with high statistical precision. Sensitivity studies incorporating luminosity scaling and systematic uncertainties show that the projected bounds improve significantly with increasing integrated luminosity, but saturate once experimental systematics exceed the few-percent level. These results highlight the crucial role of spin-based observables and beam polarization in achieving sub-percent precision on SMEFT coefficients at future lepton colliders.",

To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.",

    "abstract": "A reliable determination of the Higgs production mechanism in hadron collider experiments is essential in the program of the measurements of the Higgs couplings. We employ weak supervision, CWoLa in particular, to train deep neural networks using real data of the diphoton events, in the hope of reducing biases resulting from Monte Carlo simulations. Models based on the convolutional neural network and the transformer are tested and compared. In particular, the classification performance gets slightly better when the photon information is removed from training on the low-luminosity region of $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$. We explicitly show that the performance can be improved when the training dataset is enlarged by data augmentation using physics-motivated methods. We further demonstrate that the trained model can be successfully applied to the $H \\to ZZ$ and $H \\to Z\\gamma$ events, showing that such classifiers are agnostic to Higgs decay modes provided they do not involve strong QCD corrections.",

As an extension of our previous work on $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ states, we now construct 18 distinct interpolating currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$, $0^{--}$, and $1^{\\pm\\pm}$. Using operator product expansion (OPE) techniques and including nonperturbative contributions up to dimension six, we obtain key results: for the $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$ states, the predicted masses lie in the range of $7.2-7.3$ GeV, while the $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$ states have slightly lower masses, between 6.9 and 7.1 GeV. These predictions provide strong support for the possible existence of an $8_{[c\\bar{c}]}\\otimes 8_{[G]}\\otimes 8_{[c\\bar{c}]}$ component within the di-$J/\\psi$ structure reported by LHCb. Moreover, our analogous calculations for tetrabottom hybrid states yield mass ranges of $19.4-19.5$ GeV (for $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$) and $19.2-19.3$ GeV (for $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$), offering crucial references for future searches.",

The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and the impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is estimated. Predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the $T_{4c}$ state are presented assuming different rapidities, distinct quantum numbers of the state and center-of-mass energies. Our results indicate that the higher cross-section is associated with the production of a tensor state $T_{4c}(2^{++})$, which is dominated by the gluon-initiated process. In contrast, the production of the axial-vector state $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ is dominated by the charm-initiated process and is very sensitive to the presence (or not) of an intrinsic charm.",

The formalism employed to generate this structure dynamically is based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a general $S$-wave potential. We investigate how the relevant properties and observables characterizing this state--such as the pole position, scattering length, and effective range--might be affected by variations in the model parameters. The amplitudes encoding the distinct interpretations of the $X(3960)$ state are then used as input to calculate the femtoscopic correlation function of the $D_s^+ D_s^- $ pair, which is analyzed and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Neutrinos can acquire \"refractive masses\" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \\times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.",

    "abstract": "The existence of an eV-scale sterile neutrino has been proposed to explain several anomalous experimental results obtained over the course of the past 25 years. The first search for such a sterile neutrino conducted with data from KM3NeT/ORCA -- a water Cherenkov neutrino telescope under construction at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea -- is reported in this paper. GeV-scale atmospheric neutrino oscillations are measured by reconstructing the energy and arrival direction of up-going neutrinos that have traversed the Earth. This study is based on a data sample containing 5828 neutrino candidates collected with 6 detection units ($5\\%$ of the complete detector), corresponding to an exposure of 433 kton-years. From the expected effect of an eV-scale sterile neutrino on the first $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_\\tau$ standard oscillation maximum, simultaneous constraints are put on the magnitude of the $U_{\\mu 4}$ and $U_{\\tau 4}$ mixing elements assuming $\\Delta m^2_{41} \\geq 1$ eV$^2$. The results are compatible with the absence of mixing between active neutrinos and a sterile state, with $|U_{\\mu 4}|^2 < 0.138$ and $|U_{\\tau 4}|^2 < 0.076$ at a $90\\%$ confidence level. Such constraints are compatible with the results reported by other long-baseline experiments, and indicate that with KM3NeT/ORCA it is possible to bring crucial contributions to sterile neutrino searches in the coming years.",

The analyzed data correspond to proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 137 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the CMS experiment at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The signal scenario assumes two neutralino states, $\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_2$ and $\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_1$, with a small mass difference in the range 1$-$10 GeV and a chargino $\\widetilde{\\chi}^\\pm_1$ with an intermediate mass. The analysis focuses on the decay of the heavier neutralino into the lighter one and a virtual Z boson, which decays into two same-flavor leptons. The leptons have small transverse momentum and/or a small opening angle between the identified muons. An isolated track is used to recover events in which only one of the two leptons is identified. Multivariate discriminants are used to enhance the sensitivity by efficiently rejecting backgrounds from SM processes or misreconstructed tracks and/or leptons. The search explores a unique phase space and probes a previously unexplored region of the signal model parameter space. Mass differences between the two neutralinos are probed down to 1.5 GeV, assuming a Higgsino mass of 100 GeV. The maximum excluded Higgsino mass is 115 GeV.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\\tau \\to \\pi \\nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.",

Our approach leverages genetic algorithms to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional space of operator subsets, identifying deformations that improve agreement with data without relying on prior UV assumptions. This enables the systematic detection of SMEFT scenarios that outperform the Standard Model in explaining observed deviations. We validate the approach on current LHC and LEP measurements, perform closure tests with injected UV signals, and assess performance under high-luminosity projections. The algorithm successfully recovers relevant operator subsets and highlights directions in parameter space where deviations are most likely to emerge. Our results demonstrate the potential of SMEFT-based discovery searches driven by model selection, providing a scalable framework for future data analyses.",

This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate \"helicity streams\" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!6$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!7$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively.

    "abstract": "Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&D program at the EIC.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.",

In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $\\Omega_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.",

Before the measurement of a non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern is one of the most popular simple mixing scheme for neutrinos. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. Minimal modifications preserving one column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, yielding three patterns: a) unchanged third, b) unchanged second and c) unchanged first column. Pattern a) is excluded since it keeps $\\theta_{13}=0$. Pattern b) predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ and specific CP phase correlations, but JUNO's smaller $|V_{e2}|$ disfavors it at more than 3.5$\\sigma$. Pattern c), predicting $V_{e2} = \\cos\\tau/\\sqrt{3}$, can be in agreement with current data within 1$\\sigma$, and implies $\\sin^2\\theta_{12} = (1-3\\sin^2\\theta_{13})/3(1-\\sin^2\\theta_{13})$ and CP violating quantity $\\sin \\theta = \\pm 0.998$. The negative sign favors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Upcoming experiments can further test this scenario.",

    "abstract": "Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact and high-resolution solution. However, constructing a large-area SciFi detector demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, we present a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm, enabling up to $N_{\\textrm{SiPM}}^{\\textrm{max}}=C^{2}_{N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ SiPM channels to be read out using only ${N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ electronic channels. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the choice of appropriate diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. A multiplexed SciFi detector module comprising 21 SiPM channels read out through 7 electronic channels are constructed. Electronic tests show that this module exhibits low crosstalk between electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range from $\\sim$10 to 122 photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further show that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to the direct (per SiPM channel) readout. These results verify that the proposed method provides a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.",

In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense experimental and theoretical research, the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density remains to a large extent unexplored. From the theoretical side, the obvious non-perturbative approach is lattice QCD simulations, which are, however, obstructed by a severe sign problem. Here we employ the O(4) non-linear $\\sigma$-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class. We assume high temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, with topological charge taking the role of the baryon number, along the lines of Skyrme's model. In this effective formulation, the baryonic chemical potential $\\mu_{B}$ can be included in the lattice formulation without causing any sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations. This allows us to pin down the critical line, i.e. the critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}(\\mu_{B})$, which decreases monotonically for increasing $\\mu_{B}$. In the range $0 < \\mu_{B} \\lesssim 309~{\\rm MeV}$ and $132~{\\rm MeV} \\gtrsim T_{\\rm c} \\gtrsim 106~{\\rm MeV}$, we do not find a Critical Endpoint (CEP), although there are hints for it to be in the vicinity of the maximal $\\mu_{B}$-value that we could explore.",

We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions.

We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\\beta$ where sign problems occur.

In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.",

In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.",

These analyses consider perturbative configurations with only three partons emitting an ultra-soft non-perturbative gluon. These are dominant in the three-jet region. However, multiple soft and/or collinear emissions need to be considered to accurately describe event shape distributions near their Sudakov peak. In this region, non-perturbative shifts are usually computed by considering only two hard emitters. In this paper, we find that this approximation misses an important correction to the shift due to the emission of an additional soft wide-angle gluon.

We show that the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the presence of a medium is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum baseline, with its magnitude depending on the medium properties and splitting kinematics.

QCD corrections to power-suppressed terms in the Heavy Quark Expansion involve the renormalization of dimension-7 four-quark operators for which no general methodology is available yet. In the \\overline{MS} scheme one-loop corrections to matrix elements of dimension-7 operators violate the power counting, but we find the responsible terms to be infrared-finite and show that they can be absorbed into finite counterterms proportional to dimension-6 operators. We calculate all these counterterms and subsequently verify the consistency of our results with hadronic matrix elements calculated in the limit of a large number N_c of colours. The condition of correct power counting implies constraints on the possible definitions of evanescent operators.",

We provide an overview of the phenomenology and experimental signatures of LLPs, focusing on LLPs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We explain what determines a particle's lifetime and we show that LLPs are ubiquitous both within the Standard Model and beyond. We survey the methods used to experimentally detect and characterize particles at collider-based experiments, and discuss how searches for LLPs present both experimental challenges and exciting new possibilities for detection. Finally, we situate LHC searches for LLPs within the broader experimental landscape with a brief overview of searches for LLPs at lower-energy experiments and a discussion of astrophysical and cosmological probes offering complementary insight into the physics of LLPs beyond the Standard Model.",

We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions.

The Gaussianity relation between the mean and mean-squared transverse momenta is satisfied with approximately $99\\%$ accuracy in our numerical results, with the mean-squared transverse momentum equal to $0.231\\,\\text{GeV}^2$. Using the extracted TMD, we test the hypothesis that the quark's transverse spatial distribution also follows a Gaussian form and find that the resulting electromagnetic form factor is in good agreement with existing data.

The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and the impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is estimated. Predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the $T_{4c}$ state are presented assuming different rapidities, distinct quantum numbers of the state and center-of-mass energies. Our results indicate that the higher cross-section is associated with the production of a tensor state $T_{4c}(2^{++})$, which is dominated by the gluon-initiated process.

    "abstract": "We argue that the lattice QCD results for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the medium below the cross-over temperature are difficult to reconcile with the available hadronic models. In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.",

When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.",

In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested \"bubbles-within-bubbles.\" When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.",

Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.",

The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class.

Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style.

We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \\approx 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \\geq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \\leq 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.",

These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.",

    "title": "Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase",
    "abstract": "In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",

    "abstract": "To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \\textit{i.e.}\\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",

One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\\leq 300 \\, \\mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\\left<\\sigma v\\right>$.

The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schrödinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.",

Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\\leftrightarrow \\,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.",

Such a simple scenario yields many interesting consequences, and the imprint on oblique corrections, well expected from the mass splitting between components of VLL by virtue of VLL-RHN mixing, is our focus here. We analytically calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U with full details, carefully treating the Majorana loop to obtain the self consistent expressions free of divergence. Then, we constrain on the VLL-RHN system which only gives a sizable $T$ parameter using the PDG-2021 data and CDF-II data, separately, by imposing $T\\lesssim{\\cal O}(0.1)$.

These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data.

While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field.

In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter.

However, with an ad-hoc extended Lagrangian, that also generates $\\mathcal F_3^T$, as in the holographic approach, we have found: $ a_2$-pole: $+0.47(1.43)_{\\rm norm}(3)_{\\rm stat}(^{+0.06}_{-0.00})_{\\rm syst}$, $f_2$-pole: $+1.18(4.18)_{\\rm norm}(12)_{\\rm stat}(^{+0.24}_{-0.00})_{\\rm syst}$ and $f_2^\\prime$-pole: $+0.040(78)_{\\rm norm}(2)_{\\rm stat}$, summing to $a_\\mu^{a_2+f_2+f_2^\\prime \\rm - pole}=+1.7(4.4)$, which agree with these recent determinations within uncertainties (dominated by the $\\mathcal F_3^T$ normalization).

    "abstract": "The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\\tau \\to \\pi \\nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.",

    "abstract": "We explore the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to sterile neutrino oscillations within a $3+$(pseudo-Dirac pair) framework. We first consider a pair of two sterile neutrinos forming a pseudo-Dirac pair, then we consider a low-scale seesaw realization, that we name ``Linear-Inverse Seesaw\" model. This scenario features two nearly degenerate sterile neutrino states at the keV scale, characterized by a small mass splitting arising from a small amount of lepton number violation. In this scenario, the oscillation behavior can be described in three distinct regimes depending on the sterile-sterile mass-squared difference : low ($< 1\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$), resonant ($1$--$100\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$), and high ($> 100\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$) regimes, recovering in both low- and high-mass regimes an effective non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix. A distinctive feature of this framework is that observable effects persist even in the low-mass limit, unlike the case of standard $3+1$ scenarios, due to rapid oscillation averaging from larger keV-scale splittings. We leverage the complementarity of both near and far detectors to explore the sensitivity for $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance and $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_{\\tau}$ appearance oscillation probabilities. Our analysis reveals that DUNE can achieve significant improvements over current experimental constraints, especially in neutrino appearance modes. Additionally, we show that new CP-violating phases associated with the sterile sector can dramatically alter the sensitivity, with destructive interference potentially suppressing signals by orders of magnitude.",

Accurate computation of higher-order corrections in bound states is a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of systematically organizing contributions. In previous work, we developed an Effective Field Theory framework to address this issue and applied it to muon conversion. Here, we extend this approach to the DIO endpoint, a more complex problem due to the presence of a neutrino-antineutrino pair in the final state.

This enables the systematic detection of SMEFT scenarios that outperform the Standard Model in explaining observed deviations. We validate the approach on current LHC and LEP measurements, perform closure tests with injected UV signals, and assess performance under high-luminosity projections. The algorithm successfully recovers relevant operator subsets and highlights directions in parameter space where deviations are most likely to emerge.

Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g., during the QCD phase transition.

These minihalos may dramatically amplify the dark matter annihilation signal if dark matter is composed of self-annihilating thermal relic particles such as WIMPs. In this work, we analyse the annihilation signal from minihalos with prompt central cusps, $\\rho \\propto r^{-3/2}$, formed due to the enhanced power spectrum induced by PMFs, using gamma-ray observations of the Virgo cluster. We consider benchmarks motivated by cosmological phase transitions, focusing in particular on the electroweak and QCD transitions, where we assume maximal magnetic energy density and horizon-sized coherence length at generation (upper-limit scenarios). In addition, we include a data-driven case corresponding to the best-fit present-day PMF amplitude inferred from DESI BAO and Planck CMB measurements. Under these assumptions, we find that PMFs can place stringent bounds on WIMP annihilation. Magnetic fields with amplitudes matching the DESI-Planck best-fit values are in strong tension with self-annihilating WIMPs across a wide mass range extending beyond the TeV scale, while the electroweak- and QCD-phase-transition toy-model benchmarks would exclude thermal relics with masses below $300\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$, respectively.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of self-interaction strength on the formation and scale of turbulent vortex structures during the merger of Bose stars, using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equations. We find that vortex formation is a universal outcome of soliton mergers, with the vortex size strongly dependent on the self-interaction coupling parameter $g$. Through analysis of velocity correlations, kinetic energy spectra, and vorticity distributions, we conclude that for repulsive self-interaction, the vortex region expands as self-interaction strength increases; conversely, for attractive self-interaction, the vortex region shrinks as self-interaction strength increases.",

    "abstract": "We present a Majorana scotogenic-like loop framework in which neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability are intrinsically connected to the breaking of the discrete flavor symmetry $A_4$. This breaking leads to the emergence of the scoto-seesaw mechanism and a $Z_2$ symmetry. This naturally explains the solar and atmospheric mass-squared differences, $\\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$, while simultaneously ensuring dark matter stability. Our model accommodates normal ordering of neutrino masses, with a generalized $\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection symmetry shaping the structure of leptonic mixing and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Moreover, the model provides predictions for the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and a strong correlation between $\\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$. This correlation puts a lower bound on the fermionic DM mass. In contrast, scalar dark matter remains viable over a broad mass spectrum. A notable feature is that the low mass regime ($\\sim 15$ GeV onwards) survives owing to the presence of efficient co-annihilation channels, which are typically absent in the Majorana scotogenic scenario. Additionally, the model aligns with current and future limits from lepton flavor violation experiments.",

Conventional static phase diagrams often discard metastable false vacuum, we show that, however, in a dynamical treatment of a first-order QCD phase transition at large quark chemical potential that strongly suppresses tunneling, cosmologically longevous, and thus indispensable false vacuum naturally arises, and makes nontrivial contribution to constituting primordial quark objects. We identify two distinct branches of such primordial quark objects: quark star crusted with false vacuum, and nugget specifically referring to quark star in global false vacuum, which may account for a population of small compact stars. False vacuum in primordial objects hopefully decays during the long time since the early Universe, and its vacuum energy can power ultra-energetic long {\\gamma}-ray bursts and kHz gravitational waves within multi-messenger facilities, rendering itself an astrophysical and thus testable phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.",

In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $\\Omega_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.",

This paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10%. A careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss the prospect of shallow crust tomography in future reactor neutrino experiments.",

Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. Minimal modifications preserving one column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, yielding three patterns: a) unchanged third, b) unchanged second and c) unchanged first column. Pattern a) is excluded since it keeps $\\theta_{13}=0$.

In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory.

    "abstract": "The Quantum Gravity Mediated Entanglement (QGEM) protocol offers a novel method to probe the quantumness of gravitational interactions at non-relativistic scales. This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\\mathcal{O}(\\sim \\mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC) have been demonstrated in recent analyses to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons. The result of such analyses is imposed here as a criterion of {\\it absolute} consistency on the logarithmic (in horizon area) corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula (BHAF) for the black hole entropy, when these corrections are computed both from non-perturbative quantum fluctuations of spacetime in matter-free quantum general relativity, as well as arising due to perturbative quantum matter field fluctuations around a stationary classical black hole background spacetime. This criterion of absolute consistency is seen to be obeyed provided certain restrictions ensue on the spin-parity and number of species of the spectrum of quantum matter fluctuations. Such constraints appear to restrict the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the matter fluctuation spectrum. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.",

For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \\le 60^\\circ$, $10^\\circ \\le |b| \\le 60^\\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\\chi \\sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\\langle \\sigma \\upsilon \\rangle \\sim$ (5-8)$\\times 10^{-25} \\ \\rm cm^3 \\, s^{-1}$ for the $b\\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\\sim 5\\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",

These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands\"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.",

This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate \"helicity streams\" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!6$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!7$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively.

    "title": "Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation",
    "abstract": "Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{a\\gamma} = 1.685 \\times 10^{-10},\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \\times 10^{-8},\\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.",

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.",

    "abstract": "We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\\mathrm{SL}(2N,\\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\\mathrm{SL}(2N, \\mathbb{C})\\to \\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})\\times\\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\\mathrm{SL}(2N,\\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\\mathrm{SL}(16,\\mathbb{C})\\to \\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})\\times\\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.",

Here the version the Staruszkiewicz model is presented to describe the relativistic system of two massless charged particles interacting as follows: the retarded field of the first particle acts on the second particle, the advanced field of the second particle acts on the first particle, and a radiation reaction is neglected. The model is formulated within the Hamiltonian formalism with constraints. The system is invariant with respect to 15-parametric conformal group. The corresponding conserved canonical generators and the relativistic Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector provide a superintegrability of the system. The trajectory of the unbounded relative motion is represented by the hyperbolic conic section, similarly to the case of the non-relativistic Kepler problem. Surprisingly, however, the particle world lines appears the isotropic rectilinear rays, i.e., the particles behave as if non-interacting or neutral electrically.

It has been recently established that this shift depends significantly on the value of the considered event shape. These analyses consider perturbative configurations with only three partons emitting an ultra-soft non-perturbative gluon. These are dominant in the three-jet region. However, multiple soft and/or collinear emissions need to be considered to accurately describe event shape distributions near their Sudakov peak. In this region, non-perturbative shifts are usually computed by considering only two hard emitters. In this paper, we find that this approximation misses an important correction to the shift due to the emission of an additional soft wide-angle gluon. We then compute its contribution, and embed it in a general treatment for the shift that is valid in both the two-jet and three-jet regions.",

Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.",

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10).

We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution.

    "abstract": "The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.",

This is analogous to the known quantum energy inequalities in the vacuum situation. Our examples include thermal equilibrium on Minkowski space, and the Unruh effect on the Rindler wedge, both for the real scalar free field.",

In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface. A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.",

    "abstract": "We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.",

    "abstract": "To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \\textit{i.e.}\\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",

In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested \"bubbles-within-bubbles.\" When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.",

After a review of the connection between conformal symmetry for a Lagrangian field theory in flat space and Weyl symmetry for the same system embedded in a gravitational background, which is discussed in chapter 1, in chapter 2 the 3 energy momentum tensors correlation function is explicitly computed in three free field theories in 4 dimensions; the result is given for two of the three operators on the mass-shell. In chapter 3 a general method to map Green functions built in position space on the ground of symmetry requirements to momentum space, where they can be computed in terms of Feynman diagrams, is developed and discussed: an \"integrability\" condition, allowing to decide whether a certain correlator can exist within a Lagrangian theory, is derived. Chapter 4 discusses the possible phenomenological implications of the conformal anomaly pole which shows up in the 3 point Green function of one energy momentum tensor with two gauge currents and is interpreted as the perturbative signature of the pseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry, the dilaton. In chapter 5 we present the computation of the completely traced 4 point function of the energy momentum tensor with a method that exploits the relation between 1-loop counterterms and conformal anomalies, completely bypassing perturbative computations with Feynman diagrams. Later in chapter 6, an algorithm is developed which allows to compute recursively the completely traced Green functions of any number of energy momentum tensors in any renormalization scheme, starting from the dilaton Wess-Zumino action for conformal anomalies. This is derived by applying the Weyl-gauging procedure to the 1-loop counterterms in dimensional regularization. The result is explicitly derived and tested in 2, 4 and 6 dimensions.",

These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation.

Extending this procedure to a higher-derivative gauge theory gives rise to a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that the quadratic contributions of HDDT are directly related (up to field redefinitions) to DFT+, a T-duality invariant model associated with the bosonic string that incorporates first-order $\\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization.

We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the BMS$_3$ highest-weight vacuum character with special value of central charges coincides with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity, up to an overall phase factor ``$i$''. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We consider the five-dimensional supergravity path integral that computes a supersymmetric index, and uncover a wealth of semiclassical saddles with bubbling topology. These are complex finite-temperature configurations asymptotic to $S^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^4$, solving the supersymmetry equations. We assume a ${\\rm U}(1)^3$ symmetry given by the thermal isometry and two rotations, and present a general construction based on a rod structure specifying the fixed loci of the ${\\rm U}(1)$ isometries and their three-dimensional topology. These fixed loci may correspond to multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles, and they may have $S^3$, $S^2\\times S^1$, or lens space topology. Allowing for conical singularities gives additional topologies involving spindles and branched spheres or branched lens spaces. As a particularly significant example, we analyze in detail the configurations with a horizon and a bubble just outside of it. We determine the possible saddle-point contribution of these configurations to the gravitational index by evaluating their on-shell action and the relevant thermodynamic relations. We also spell out two limits leading to well-defined Lorentzian solutions. The first is the extremal limit, which gives the known BPS black ring and black lens solutions. The on-shell action and chemical potentials remain well-defined in this limit and should thus provide the contribution of the black ring and black lens to the gravitational index. The second is a limit leading to horizonless bubbling solutions, which have purely imaginary action.",

To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order.

These models extend factorised scattering beyond the conventional framework, featuring both the usual hierarchy of integer-spin conserved charges and an additional tower of fractional-spin ones. Our construction relies on a reparametrisation of rapidity space that lifts standard scattering amplitudes to a multiplet related by an internal cyclic symmetry. This construction is naturally embedded within a generalised Gibbs ensemble, which provides the natural framework for a consistent graded Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. This leads to new Y-systems encoding the graded spectrum. In a special case, these functional relations match those obtained via the ODE/IM correspondence from the monodromy analysis of the quantum cubic oscillator. Even in the simplest models, for one sign of the auxiliary temperature, the finite-volume ground-state energy spectrum undergoes an infinite sequence of level crossings as the coupling strength increases. A preliminary analysis also suggests that these theories exhibit structural connections with cyclic orbifolds. Within this setup, one can consistently include extra CDD factors that realise fractional-spin analogues of the $T\\bar{T}$ deformation. In analytically tractable cases, a Hagedorn-like behaviour is observed for a sign of the flow parameter, and the deformed spectrum develops a finite limiting temperature.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework based on the postulate of quantum vacuum self-consistency, where classical backgrounds -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state, sustained by the vacuum expectation values of the fluctuations they support. Using a background-field, heat-kernel approach, we derive the coupled low-energy effective equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs fields as vacuum equations of state. This recovers the Einstein, Yang--Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative operators required for quantum consistency, with all couplings running coherently under a single RG flow. The framework is embedded in a UV-complete theory of higher-derivative gravity (quantized with the fakeon prescription for unitarity) coupled to the Standard Model (SM). We assume the combined system flows to an asymptotically safe fixed point in the UV, rendering the theory predictive. A solvable O(N) model is used to explicitly demonstrate how the vacuum gap equations constrain both the condensate and curvature. The framework yields robust phenomenological predictions: (1) The loop-induced $R^2$ term drives Starobinsky-type inflation, with $n_s \\simeq 1 - 2/N_e$ and $r \\simeq 12/N_e^2$. (2) Short-distance corrections to gravity are quantified and satisfy laboratory bounds. (3) The speed of gravitational waves is luminal, consistent with GW170817. The combination of asymptotic safety with the vacuum gap equations correlates IR observables in gravity and particle physics, constraining SM parameters from the properties of the UV fixed point. The theory is testable across cosmology and precision gravity, reducing to General Relativity and the SM at low energies with controlled corrections.",

Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.",

We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity. This ensures global validity for all regular loops ($C \\in H^{1/2}(\\mathbb{S}^1, \\mathbb{R}^4)$). Matching this confining factor with the gluon condensate via the QCD Operator Product Expansion (OPE) determines the physical string tension $\\kappa \\sim \\Lambda_{QCD}^2$ (up to a universal numerical factor). This framework provides a first-principles derivation of confinement in large-$N_c$ QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.",

    "abstract": "We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.",

    "abstract": "For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.",

A first step in finding the ontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in Quantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in analogy to the scalar boson case.

Here we propose a generalization of vertex algebras involving linear operators in parameters $z_1,\\ldots,z_n$. One may interpret these as being the components of a set of coordinates on an $n$-dimensional algebraic variety. These are referred to as cohomological vertex algebras (CVAs): the formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain modifications of the formal $n$-disk. We prove several structural theorems for CVAs and give a definition of cohomological vertex operator algebras (CVOAs). Using a reconstruction theorem for CVAs, we provide basic examples such as the $\\beta\\gamma$-system, the Heisenberg CVA, and the affine Kac-Moody CVAs.

    "abstract": "Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.",

Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances.

    "abstract": "When 3D relative displacement $\\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $>3.7\\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \\mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\\lbrace \\mathbf{Q}_n \\rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour.

We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions.

We do so by considering a $D$-dimensional spacetime and the matter sector to be described by nonlinear electrodynamics and/or a scalar field. We find that, for this particular family of models, the action and field equations can indeed be written in terms of a modified matter source within GR. However, when several matter sources are combined, this interpretation is no longer possible if $h(T)$ is a nonlinear function, due to the emergence of crossed terms that mix together the scalar and vector sectors.",

    "abstract": "Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed form solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.",

By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.",

In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.",

In particular, the matrix-valued transmission and reflection coefficients for the full-line lattice are explicitly expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for the left and right lattice fragments. Since the matrix-valued scattering coefficients are easier to determine for the fragments than for the full-line lattice, the factorization formula presented provides a method to determine the scattering coefficients for full-line lattices.

Working on the idèle class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--Pólya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow.",

By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks.

The statistical properties of the product are encoded in its generalised Lyapunov exponent whose computation reduces to finding the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator. In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(\\tau^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible. For $d=2$, we compute the growth rate of the product in terms of complete elliptic integrals. By letting the elliptic modulus vary, we obtain a spectral problem, corresponding to a modulus-dependent random renewing flow, which may be viewed as a perturbation of the spectral problem for the angular Laplacian. In this way, we deduce expansions for the generalised Lyapunov exponent in ascending powers of the modulus. These expansions generalise to the case $d \\ge 2$, and we compute the first few terms explicitly for $d \\in \\{2,3\\}$.",

As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field. Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Leblé and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.",

    "title": "Variations of the Hardy Z-Function and the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture",
    "abstract": "In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.",

Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters.

The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model.

We introduce an iterative bicolored percolation process in two dimensions and show that it can both preserve and transform criticality. Starting from critical configurations, such as the O$(n)$ loop and fuzzy Potts models, successive coarse-graining generates a hierarchy of distinct yet critical generations. Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations.",

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .",

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.",

In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \\leq 3$.

Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation is analyzed via Hörmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane, reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow. The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations.

The proof relies on the representation of the real time Duhamel series in imaginary time, which allows to prove its convergence uniformly in the scaling parameter and in the size of system, at low temperatures. Furthermore, it allows to exploit a suitable cancellation for the scaling limit of the model, related to the emergent anomalous chiral gauge symmetry of relativistic one-dimensional fermions. The cancellation implies that, as the temperature and the scaling parameter are sent to zero, the linear response is the only contribution to the full response of the system. The explicit form of the leading contribution to the response function is determined by lattice conservation laws.

Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.",

Inspired by nonabelian extension theory of Lie algebras, we define geometric deformations of curved $L_\\infty$ algebras constructed from a vector bundle $V\\to M$, and demonstrate that such deformations uniquely correspond to Lie algebroid structures on $V$. Explicit computations reveal that the first Atiyah-Chern class, expressible via deformed $L_\\infty$ brackets, transgresses to the de Rham coboundary of the modular class. In the case of action Lie algebroids, the leading-order Atiyah-Chern classes correspond to the equivariant Chern characters.

    "abstract": "In this article, we study concave recursions on trees, which appear widely in information theory through algorithms such as belief propagation, and in statistical mechanics through models on tree-like graphs, including the Ising model, percolation, and more generally, the random cluster model. These tree recursions can, in fact, be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton--Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p>1$, for a quenched realization of $T_n$. In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on $T_n$ (with cluster weight parameter in $(0,2]$ and wired boundary condition) providing sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite third moment; (ii) $n^{-1/(\\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\\alpha \\in (1,3)$.",

Key contributions include: (1) exact exponential decay rates for spectral gaps of the almost Mathieu operator, addressing a question raised by Goldstein; (2) sharp arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic operators on higher-dimensional lattices, which in particular resolves and generalizes Jitomirskaya's phase transition conjecture; and (3) stratified growth patterns for extended eigenfunctions revealing universal partial hierarchical structures for subcritical quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators. The proofs are based on novel frameworks-structured quantitative almost reducibility and sharp quantitative duality-to overcome the longstanding challenge of taming infinitely many rotation-number resonances, which enables us to obtain optimal arithmetic reducibility results for analytic SL(2,R)-cocycles, thereby solving another Jitomirskaya's conjecture. These methods enable a first comprehensive treatment of resonance-driven dynamical asymptotics.",

We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. In local dimension d <= 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. We construct a new family of states for which the properties of PPT and separability can be characterized for all dimensions, generalizing results from the literature.

Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin Principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications. In the latter example, both closed and open quantum systems are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct effective mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.",

The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.",

The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of (finite-rank) compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\\Omega $: If $\\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.",

The existence domain remains invariant with the increase of the potential's depth. Solitons with a large number N of lobes are stable in a wide parameter region, up to N=48 and even farther. Actually, stable multipole solitons of an arbitrarily high order N can be found, provided that the trough's radius is big enough. The power of stable multipoles is essentially larger in comparison to previously studied models. It is demonstrated analytically and numerically that the application of a phase torque initiates stable rotation of the multipole complexes.

We observe that the monomials $D_x^mD_y^rD_t^n$ and $D_x^{m_1}D_y^{m_2}D_t^{m_3}D_z^{m_4}$ do not result genuine four-soliton solutions. In addition, we obtain three-soliton, lump, and hybrid solutions of these three type of equations for particular powers of the Hirota $D$-operators.",

    "abstract": "The Stuart-Landau oscillator generalized to $D > 2$ dimensions has SO($D$) rotational symmetry. We study the collective dynamics of a system of $K$ such oscillators of dimensions $D =$ 3 and 4, with coupling chosen to either preserve or break rotational symmetry. This leads to emergent dynamical phenomena that do not have analogs in the well-studied case of $D=2$. Further, the larger number of internal parameters allows for the exploration of different forms of heterogeneity among the individual oscillators. When rotational symmetry is preserved there can be various forms of synchronization as well as multistability and $partial$ amplitude death, namely, the quenching of oscillations within a subset of variables that asymptote to the same constant value. The oscillatory dynamics in these cases are characterized by phase-locking and phase-drift. When the coupling breaks rotational symmetry we observe $partial$ synchronization (when a subset of the variables coincide and oscillate) and $partial$ oscillation death (when a subset of variables asymptote to different stationary values), as well as the coexistence of these different partial quenching phenomena.",

Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.",

In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\\sigma$-Painlevé III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlevé functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\\sigma$-Painlevé III$'$ functions for general real exponents.

Importantly, we focus on systems that are inherently modeled in discrete time-such as opinion dynamics, Markov chains, diffusion on networks, and population models-reflecting their natural formulation in many real-world contexts. By an open network, we mean one that is coupled to its environment, through both external signals that are received by designated input nodes and response signals that are released back into the environment via a separate set of output nodes. We develop a general framework for characterizing whether such networks amplify (pass) or suppress (block) the external inputs. Our approach combines the transfer function of the network with the discrete time controllability Gramian, using the H2-norm to quantify signal amplification. We introduce a computationally efficient network index based on the Gramian trace and eigenvalues, enabling scalable comparisons across network topologies. Application of our method to a broad set of empirical networks, spanning biological, technological, and ecological domains, uncovers consistent structural signatures associated with passing or blocking behavior. These findings shed light on how the network architecture and the particular selection of input and output nodes shape information flow in real-world systems, with broad implications for control, signal processing, and network design.",

Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems.",

By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this research have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of ecological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding complex dynamical behaviors.",

It is shown that these regimes can be classified into two main types depending on the evolution of the instantaneous frequencies: stationary (4:0 and 2:2), characterized by constancy of phase ratios and instantaneous frequencies, and switching (3:1 and 2:1:1), in which metastable processes with periodic switching of synchronous states are observed: for different time intervals, different types of locking of instantaneous frequencies of oscillator pairs and different types of phase ratios were observed. For the 4:0 and 2:2 regimes, analytical expressions for the synchronization frequencies were derived. The presence of bistability has been revealed depending on the initial conditions of different synchronous regimes at the same parameters: sets of individual frequencies and value of coupling strength.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.",

Then we introduce new `fission' trees to treat structure groups of any (simple) classical type, leading to a complete classification of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements, and singling out an infinite family of noncrystallographic examples in type D. Moreover, we reinterpret Bessis' lift of Springer theory as the study of `quasi-generic' deformations, corresponding to irregular singularities whose leading coefficient is regular semisimple upon pullback along a local cyclic covering of the base curve.

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement.

    "abstract": "Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.",

    "title": "Puzzling Isotonic Odd-Even Staggering of Charge Radii in Deformed Rare Earth Nuclei",
    "abstract": "The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.",

The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schrödinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.",

    "abstract": "The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Three-quasiparticle $K$-isomeric states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones within the $A\\sim 180$ mass region are systematically investigated using configuration-constrained potential energy surface calculations. The calculations successfully reproduce the excitation energies and deformations of known high-$K$ isomers in the nuclei from $^{175}$Tm to $^{181}$Re. For the nuclei closer to the $Z=82$ shell closure ($^{183}$Ir, $^{185}$Au, and $^{187}$Tl), predictions for the configurations of observed and yet-to-be-observed isomers are provided. The results reveal strong shape polarization, where the three-quasiparticle states are driven to larger deformations compared to the often shape-soft or spherical ground states. A particularly rich spectrum of shape coexistence is predicted in $^{187}$Tl, where several high-$K$ three-quasiparticle configurations with distinct prolate, oblate, and triaxial shapes are found to coexist at similar excitation energies. Notably, the oblate-deformed $K^{\\pi}=29/2^+$ configuration at $E_x = 1839$ keV is proposed to be responsible for a long-lived isomer. This study provides a comprehensive picture of shape evolution and coexistence in high-$K$ multi-quasiparticle states, offering valuable insights for future experimental research.",

    "abstract": "The fission barrier energy is a fundamental property of nuclear structure that governs the stability of nuclei against fission, directly affecting their spontaneous fission half-lives and the formation of superheavy elements. However, because it can only be measured indirectly, it also enables the emergence of alternative, complementary, fast, and accurate prediction tools for traditional theoretical models. In this study, we examine the use of classical, hybrid, and quantum support vector regression (SVR) approaches to estimate fission barrier heights, starting from fundamental nuclear properties and their derived additional properties. For this purpose, eight different SVR-based approaches are considered: (i) Classical SVR, (ii) Enhanced Classical SVR with polynomial and trigonometric feature extensions, (iii) Quantum-Inspired SVR, (iv) Hybrid SVR, (v) Enhanced Hybrid SVR, (vi) Quantum Core SVR, (vii) Fixed-Parameter Quantum Feature Map SVR, and (viii) Pure Quantum SVR. The models were trained and tested on a dataset of 317 isotopes in the Z (atomic number) range of 98-126, encompassing the actinide and superheavy regions. The model performance was evaluated in terms of R2, RMSE, MAE, and training-test R2 gap. The results show that the hybrid model achieves the best overall performance. However, while quantum-enhanced approaches are still limited by circuit depth and optimization precision, they achieve competitive accuracy comparable to classical results. Considering future developments in quantum hardware and algorithms, quantum approaches are expected to achieve considerable improvements. The findings suggest that quantum machine learning can supplement classical approaches and offer a promising path toward more accurate and efficient nuclear property predictions.",

The original fitting protocol of the Gogny interaction has been adapted to include both finite range spin-orbit and tensor terms, adding new constraints and filters linked to relevant data.

    "abstract": "We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.",

We demonstrate that in peripheral collisions, a significant $\\cos 2\\phi$ asymmetry in the decay leptons of coherently photoproduced $J/\\psi$ mesons arises purely from the initial-state geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. This modulation originates from the linear polarization of coherent photons, which is radially aligned in impact parameter space and transferred to the vector meson. By employing light-cone perturbation theory within the dipole formalism, we calculate the centrality dependence of this asymmetry for collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Our predictions quantitatively reproduce STAR data. This observable thus provides a rigorous benchmark for distinguishing electromagnetic initial-state effects from collective medium dynamics.",

In this paper, we study modifications to this, $\\cos(2\\psi_{12})$, azimuthal pattern in the presence of a quark-gluon plasma. To that end, we consider a simplified setup in which a narrow and energetic QCD antenna is formed inside a medium of fixed length and radiates a collinear emission outside it. The calculation includes both light and heavy-quarks. Further, we do not include medium-induced spin-flip interactions since they are energy suppressed in our formalism. We show that the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the presence of a medium is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum baseline, with its magnitude depending on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. For a medium with a momentum space anisotropy, we find that the azimuthal modulation acquires a phase shift, i.e., $\\cos(2\\psi_{12}) \\to \\cos(2\\psi_{12}+\\phi_{\\rm med })$, where $\\phi_{\\rm med}$ is a process-dependent function that again depends on the medium properties and splitting kinematics.

In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.",

We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions.

We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.",

In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores radial and non-radial oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) as they evolve from hot, neutrino-rich configurations through deleptonization to cold, catalyzed states. The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and the full General Relativistic framework. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error in the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\\tilde{\\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing the interiors of PNSs and constraining the EoS of dense matter.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.",

    "title": "Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature",
    "abstract": "Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schrödinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.",

Within this theoretical framework, a chemical potential is introduced, resulting in non-zero values for the electric current and charge number density.

    "abstract": "A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.",

    "abstract": "The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.",

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.",

    "abstract": "Networks of radiation detectors provide a platform for real-time radioactive source detection and identification in urban environments. Detection algorithms in these systems must adapt to naturally-occurring changes in background, which requires well-characterized relationships between precipitation events and their corresponding radiological signature. We present a description of rain-induced radon progeny deposition events occurring in Chicago from September 2023 through February 2024. We measure ambient gamma radiation levels, precipitation rate, temperature, pressure and relative humidity in a network of sensor nodes. For each identified precipitation period, we decompose spectra into static- and radon-associated components as defined by a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. We find a consistent power-law relationship between a precipitation-dependent peak of the radon progeny proxy (RPP) and the peak strength of radon-associated NMF component for most precipitation events. We conduct a case study of a rainfall period with abnormally high levels of implied radon progeny concentration and describe its temporal and spatial evolution. We hypothesize this phenomenon is due to the air mass path that intersects a uranium-rich region of Wyoming. Finally, we cluster precipitation events into three distinct categories. One category roughly corresponds to events with deep low-pressure systems and high relative radon concentration, while another is characteristic of light stratiform rain with slightly higher temperatures and intermediate relative radon concentration. The third category contains a weak-gradient or lake breeze convection showers with intermittent precipitation and low relative radon concentration. These findings suggest that radiological anomaly detection could be improved by training unique background models corresponding to each category of meteorological event.",

Our approach is based on performing precision muonic x-ray spectroscopy of the $2s-2p$ manifold, which is also referred to as the Lamb shift. These transitions are too weak to be detected with dispersive methods and too overlapping to be resolved by solid-state detectors. Here, we propose the use of cryogenic microcalorimeters, which possess high efficiency and excellent energy resolution in the relevant energy regime, coupled with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement. These precise reference quadrupole moments serve as valuable inputs for nuclear structure studies and for benchmarking state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations in open-shell elements.",

Traditional learning materials, such as Braille and large-print textbooks, are often scarce or delayed, while practical experiments are rarely adapted for accessibility. Additionally, mainstream educators lack the training to effectively support BVI students, and Teachers for the Visually Impaired (TVIs) often lack scientific expertise. As a result, BVI individuals remain underrepresented in scientific jobs, reinforcing a cycle of exclusion. However, technological advancements and inclusive initiatives are opening new opportunities. Outreach programs aim to make science engaging and accessible for BVI individuals through multi-sensory learning experiences. Hands-on involvement in these activities fosters confidence and interest in scientific careers. Beyond sparking interest, equipping BVI students with the right tools and skills is crucial for their academic success. Early exposure to assistive technologies enables BVI students to navigate scientific studies independently. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools further enhance accessibility by converting visual data into descriptive text and providing interactive assistance. Several learning sessions demonstrated the effectiveness of these interventions, with participants successfully integrating into university-level science programs. Educating BVI and their teachers on these tools and good pratices is the aim of our project AccesSciencesDV. Research careers offer promising opportunities for BVI, especially in computational fields.

OKG, with its broadband response and high throughput without phase-matching, is especially promising when used at high repetition rates under focused illumination. Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast detection scheme using the third-order nonlinearity of graphene and thin graphite films, operating at 1 GHz with sub-nanojoule pulses and achieving 141 fs temporal resolution. Their exceptionally large nonlinear refractive index, orders of magnitude higher than conventional Kerr media, enhances detection efficiency at smaller thicknesses, enables sub-picosecond response, and supports broadband operation. Their atomic-scale thickness minimizes dispersion and simplifies integration with microscopy platforms, optical fibers, and nanophotonic circuits, making them a compact, practical material platform for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $\\Delta$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $\\Delta$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $\\Delta$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.",

OAM addition is observed upon passing the beam through consecutive fork gratings. The OAM of the beam was found to be decoupled from its spin angular momentum (SAM). Practical implementation of angular momentum control by consecutive devices in the x-ray regime opens new experimental opportunities, such as direct measurement of OAM beams without resorting to phase sensitive techniques, including holography. OAM analyzers utilizing fork gratings can be used to characterize the beams produced by synchrotron and free electron lasers sources; they can also be used in scattering experiments.",

    "abstract": "Circular Rydberg states offer advantages for quantum information and quantum simulation platforms due to their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Unfortunately, current techniques for the production of these states remain technically challenging. Here we investigate the ability of twisted electron collisions to produce circular Rydberg states. Twisted electrons carry quantized orbital angular momentum that can be transferred to the electronic state of the atom, potentially providing an efficient means to generate circular Rydberg states. Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum. These findings demonstrate that twisted-electron excitation may provide a feasible and potentially advantageous pathway for generating circular Rydberg states.",

This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.",

Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.",

    "abstract": "Negative information often exerts a disproportionately strong impact on human decision-making, a phenomenon known as the negativity bias. In behavioral economics, this effect is formally captured by Prospect Theory, which posits that losses loom larger than equivalent gains. For example, a single negative product review can outweigh numerous positive ones, reflecting this principle of loss aversion in consumer behavior. While this psychological effect has been widely documented, its implications for collective opinion dynamics, critical for understanding market stability and reputation dynamics, remain poorly understood. Here, we generalize the $q$-voter model with independence by introducing opinion-dependent influence group sizes, $q_+$ and $q_-$, which represent the social reinforcement needed to change an opinion from negative to positive and from positive to negative, respectively. We study two versions of this asymmetric model: a baseline model that reduces to the standard $q$-voter model when $q_+ = q_- = q$, and an extended model that incorporates an additional asymmetry expressed as a preference for one opinion. In its reduced version, this represents a minimal model in terms of non-linearity within the $q$-voter framework that allows for discontinuous phase transitions and hysteresis. Using mean-field analysis and computer simulations, we show that these modifications lead to rich collective behaviors, including double hysteresis, one form of which is irreversible, providing a mechanism for path-dependence and the sustained, irrecoverable damage to collective sentiment, brand equity, or market confidence.",

    "abstract": "Extreme gust encounters by finite wings with disturbance velocity exceeding their cruise speed remain largely unexplored, while particularly relevant to miniature-scale aircraft. This study considers extreme aerodynamic flows around a square wing and the large, unsteady forces that result from gust encounters. We analyse the evolution of three-dimensional, large-scale vortical structures and their complex interactions with the wing by performing direct numerical simulations at a chord-based Reynolds number of 600. We find that a strong incoming positive gust vortex induces a prominent leading-edge vortex (LEV) on the upper surface of the wing, accompanied by tip vortices (TiVs) strengthened through the interaction. Conversely, a strong negative gust vortex induces an LEV on the lower surface of the wing and causes a reversal in TiV orientation. In both extreme vortex gust encounters, the wing experiences significant lift fluctuations. Furthermore, we identify two opposing effects of the TiVs on the large lift fluctuations. First, the enhanced or reversed TiVs contribute to significant lift surges or drops by generating large low-pressure cores near the wing. Second, the TiVs play a part in attenuating lift fluctuations through enhanced downwash or upwash, formation of an arch vortex, and distortion of vortical structure around the wing corners. The second effect outweighs the first, resulting in smaller transient lift changes on the finite wing compared to the 2D wing. We also show that flying above a positive gust vortex or flying below a negative one can mitigate lift fluctuations during encounters. The current findings provide potential guidance on how TiV dynamics and wing positions could be leveraged to alleviate large transient lift fluctuations experienced by finite wings in severe gust conditions.",

We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.",

This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour.

Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Growing energy demands of modern digital devices necessitate alternative, low-power computing mechanisms. When incident loads take the form of acoustic or vibrational waves, the ability to mechanically process information eliminates the need for transduction, paving the way for passive computing. Recent studies have proposed systems that learn and execute mechanical logic through buckling, bistability, and origami-inspired lattices. However, owing to the large timescales of shape morphing, such concepts suffer from slow operation or require active stimulation of adaptive materials. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach to mechanical logic, leveraging the rich dynamics of wave propagation in elastic structures. In lieu of traditional forward-design tools, such as band diagrams and transmission spectra, we employ a multi-faceted topology optimization approach, enabling us to identify candidate waveguide configurations within an extremely large design space. By incorporating voids within an otherwise uniform substrate, the optimized waveguides are able to precisely manipulate wave propagation paths, triggering desirable interferences of the scattered wavefield that culminate in energy localization at readouts corresponding to a given logic function. An experimental setup is used to demonstrate the efficacy of such logic gates and their resilience to non-uniform loading. By implementing these building blocks into a mechanical adder, we demonstrate the scalable deployment of more sophisticated mechanical computing circuits, opening up new avenues in mechanical signal processing and physical computing.",

    "abstract": "We develop a new, efficient, and accurate method to simulate frequency-domain borehole electromagnetic (EM) measurements acquired in the presence of three-dimensional (3D) variations of the anisotropic subsurface conductivity. The method is based on solving the quasi-static Maxwell equations with a goal-oriented finite-volume discretization via block-quadrature reduced-order modeling. Discretization is performed with a Lebedev grid that enables accurate and conservative solutions in the presence of any form of anisotropic electrical conductivity. Likewise, the method makes use of a new effective-medium approximation to locally account for non-conformal boundaries and large contrasts in electrical conductivity, especially in the vicinity of EM sources and receivers. The finite-volume discretization yields a large symmetric linear system of equations, which is reduced to a set of smaller structured problems via block Lanczos recursion. The formulation also enables the efficient calculation of the adjoint solution, which is necessary for gradient-based inversion of the measurements to estimate the associated spatial distribution of electrical conductivity, i.e., to solve the inverse problem. Specific applications and verifications of the new numerical simulation algorithm are considered for the case of borehole ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity measurements (UDAR) typically used for subsurface well geosteering and navigation. We verify the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of this approach using synthetic UDAR measurements acquired in a 3D formation inspired by North-Sea geology.

    "abstract": "Subglacial blisters form due to the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes into grounded ice sheets, and are characterised by elastic ice uplift and transient ice-velocity anomalies. Although blister occurrence is confirmed by observations, the dynamics of blisters and their impacts on ice flow remain poorly represented in current subglacial hydrology models, as typical cavity-channel system models cannot capture short-timescale blister formation, propagation, and relaxation. Here we present a unified, self-consistent modelling framework that directly couples blister evolution with the subglacial drainage system, extending existing subglacial hydrology models to account for transient responses to rapid lake drainage events. Numerical simulations, validated by field observations, reveal distinct seasonal behavior: during summer, lake drainage generates short-lived blisters that rapidly leak water into a pre-existing drainage system of efficient, channelised water pathways, whereas winter drainage results in persistent blisters that propagate and serve as the primary meltwater pathway at the ice-bed interface. The dynamics of blister propagation and leakage in our model are governed by effective viscosity and a characteristic leakage length scale, which reflects the connection between the blister and the surrounding hydrological network. This unified model offers a valuable tool for investigating blister dynamics and their interplay with subglacial hydrology, facilitating the interpretation of observed surface uplift and ice-velocity variations following supraglacial lake drainage events.",

    "abstract": "The two promising methods for capturing high-speed flows are local artificial diffusivity (LAD) and centralised gradient-based reconstruction (C-GBR), the former being computationally economical and the latter being more robust and stable but expensive. While the LAD approach captures discontinuities by adding artificial fluid transport coefficients, C-GBR employs a wave appropriate discontinuity sensor to obtain cleaner results and utilises the HLLC approximate Riemann solver for computing inviscid fluxes. The efficacy of these schemes is initially demonstrated in single-species 1D and 2D test cases. Moreover, the shock-capturing capability is assessed for 3D supersonic and hypersonic turbulent boundary layers. The accuracy of LAD predictions is comparable to that of C-GBR for the test case of a supersonic turbulent boundary layer. From the stability front, all simulations are found to be stable with the C-GBR scheme, whereas the LAD-based simulations are observed to abruptly diverge for supersonic and hypersonic flows over compression corners with stronger shocks and larger flow separations. From the computational front, the LAD-based schemes are $1.17 - 2.32 \\times$ faster than the monotonicity-preserving explicit/implicit C-GBR schemes. A hybrid approach leveraging the strengths of LAD and GBR schemes is proposed as a promising solution for high-speed turbulent flows with strong shock-boundary layer interactions. The efficacy of the hybrid LAD-GBR solver is demonstrated for the compressible triple-point and supersonic compression ramp test cases. For the M2.9, $24^{\\circ}$ case, the hybrid solver was stable and achieved a notable $1.67 \\times$ speed-up over the C-GBR scheme.",

Nevertheless, operationally, the transverse tunes may change dynamically, crossing these resonances, and resulting in unwanted beam quality degradation and beam loss. For high intensity beams the process of resonance crossing is even more critical as space charge, in addition to the incoherent effects, may generate also coherent effects on the beam envelope dynamics. The interplay of the speed of resonance crossing, the space charge incoherent tune spread, and half-integer resonance width are fundamental for the beam behavior. In this paper we study the crossing of the half-integer resonance $2Q_y=9$ in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster~(PSB) for a range of parameters using a coasting beam.

    "abstract": "The spin-orbital entanglement in $5d^1$ transition metal ions embedded in double perovskites, where anomalous effective magnetic dipole moments are frequently observed, is quantified by the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy $\\Delta S_{\\rm vN}^{\\rm SO}$. The framework is grounded on the relativistic crystal field theory, and is illustrated through a series of quantum materials: $A_2{\\rm TaCl}_6$ ($A = {\\rm K}, {\\rm Rb}$), $A_2{\\rm MgReO}_6$ ($A = {\\rm Ca}, {\\rm Sr}, {\\rm Ba}$) and ${\\rm Ba_2NaOsO_6}$, all analyzed in their paramagnetic phases, alongside the ${\\rm ReF_6}$ molecular system.

The entropies obtained for the relativistic crystal field states $\\Gamma_8(t_{2g})$ and $\\Gamma_8(e_g)$ uncover that, a larger effective magnetic dipole moment can be attributed to a grater spin-orbital entanglement, yet paradoxically not to a larger spin-orbit coupling constant.",

    "abstract": "Recently, using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, it has been demonstrated that in laser based proton acceleration with micro-structured targets, a single rectangular groove on the target front offers significant proton cut-off enhancement with linearly polarised laser pulses. In the present work, three-dimensional investigations are carried out to identify notable differences between cylindrical and cuboidal groove geometries both of which correspond to a rectangular groove in a two-dimensional case. In particular, a waveguide model is employed to analyse the effect of the groove geometry and extensive three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed to demonstrate the distinct behaviour of laser pulse and electrons for cylindrical and cuboidal grooves. Further, the effect of a circular polarisation of the incident laser pulse on the spectra of accelerated protons is studied. It is shown that contrary to our initial expectations, cylindrical symmetry and circular polarisation do not play well together and cause as much as 15$\\%$ decay in proton cut-off energies as compared to the case of cylindrical symmetry and linear polarisation.",

    "title": "Subspace Acceleration for Efficient Nonlinear Water Wave Simulation",
    "abstract": "Efficient simulation of nonlinear and dispersive free-surface flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains a central challenge in ocean and coastal engineering. The computational bottleneck arises from solving a time-dependent discretized Poisson problem at every time step to enforce divergence free flow. This is crucial to ensure conservation of mass and requires solving long sequences of time-dependent linear systems typically using iterative methods, such as the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. In this work, we investigate new subspace acceleration techniques for improving initial guesses to reduce the number of iterations required by iterative solvers, with a focus on nonlinear wave propagation problems. We extend the original subspace acceleration method by incorporating the complete history of previous solutions through an exponentially weighted formulation. This approach eliminates the need for repeated sketching and orthonormalization, resulting in a more efficient and scalable strategy to generate better initial guesses. Our method is implemented within a high-order finite-difference framework using a method-of-lines formulation and a low-storage Runge-Kutta time integration scheme. We demonstrate that subspace acceleration significantly reduces the number of GMRES iterations when solving the Poisson equation in nonlinear water wave simulations. Performance is evaluated on two benchmark problems: nonlinear stream function wave propagation and harmonic wave generation over a submerged bar. In both cases, the new approach achieves substantial improvements in computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Although demonstrated using high-order finite difference methods, the technique is discretization independent and broadly applicable to incompressible free-surface flow solvers.",

    "abstract": "We develop a nonlinear model for electroosmotic transport in a constricted microchannel with a compliant lower wall, with applications to soft microfluidics, bio-inspired sensing, and energy harvesting. The formulation couples electroosmotic slip-driven flow under a globally constrained electric field with pressure-driven lubrication and elastic wall deformation, modeled as a clamped Kirchhoff-Love plate. Short-range intermolecular stresses are incorporated through an extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek framework combining electrostatic double-layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction, enabling us to probe the nonlinear coupling between intermolecular forces, wall deformation, and electroosmotic flow in compliant microchannels. The flow is governed by six nondimensional parameters: wall compliance, geometric curvature, electrostatic and van der Waals strengths, scaled Debye length, and Dukhin number. Asymptotic analysis clarifies the role of these parameters in limiting regimes. In the stiff-wall limit, electroosmotic slip acts as a uniform offset to the pressure-driven flow. Fully coupled spectral collocation simulations confirm the asymptotic predictions and capture nonlinear feedback between pressure, deformation, and intermolecular stresses. Three regimes emerge: a stiff-wall regime with negligible deformation, a deformation-limited regime in which elastic narrowing strongly suppresses flux, and a repulsion-limited regime where DLVO forces cap wall deflection and prevent collapse. These results show how elasticity, geometry, and molecular forces jointly regulate electroosmotic lubrication and provide scaling rules for the design of compliant electrokinetic channels operating under nanometric confinement.",

Importantly, we focus on systems that are inherently modeled in discrete time-such as opinion dynamics, Markov chains, diffusion on networks, and population models-reflecting their natural formulation in many real-world contexts. By an open network, we mean one that is coupled to its environment, through both external signals that are received by designated input nodes and response signals that are released back into the environment via a separate set of output nodes. We develop a general framework for characterizing whether such networks amplify (pass) or suppress (block) the external inputs. Our approach combines the transfer function of the network with the discrete time controllability Gramian, using the H2-norm to quantify signal amplification. We introduce a computationally efficient network index based on the Gramian trace and eigenvalues, enabling scalable comparisons across network topologies. Application of our method to a broad set of empirical networks, spanning biological, technological, and ecological domains, uncovers consistent structural signatures associated with passing or blocking behavior. These findings shed light on how the network architecture and the particular selection of input and output nodes shape information flow in real-world systems, with broad implications for control, signal processing, and network design.",

    "title": "Evaluating Parametric Car-Following Models in Naturalistic Congestion: Insights in Driver Behavior and Model Limitations",
    "abstract": "Car-Following is a broadly studied state of driving, and many modeling approaches through various heuristics and engineering methods have been proposed. Congestion is a common traffic phenomenon also widely investigated, both from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. Yet, current literature lack a unified evaluation of Car-Following models with naturalistic congestion data. This paper compares the performance of five parametric Car-Following models: IDM, ACC, Gipps, OVM, and FVDM, using a rich naturalistic congestion dataset. The five models in question is found to perform similarly when optimized over the same RMSNE metric. Sub-sequences of Car-Following where models noticeably disagree with driver behavior is noticed and separately investigated. A review of corresponding front-facing and cabin video data reveals distraction and driving with momentum as potential reasons for model-reality difference. We further show that drivers often employ coasting and idle creep under Car-Following in different speed ranges, which existing parametric models fail to capture. Finally, time-series clustering is performed and analysis of result clusters align with empirical findings. Our findings highlight the necessity to consider vehicle dynamical properties including coasting and idle creep abilities, which drivers take extensive use of under low speed congestions. Future research could integrate such parameters with traditional parametric models to improve congestion modeling performance. We also suggest future research into investigating temporal correlations between clustered blocks to reveal behavioral transition patterns exhibited by drivers in congestions.

    "abstract": "A challenge in physical oceanography is quantifying the energy content of waves and balanced flows and the fluxes that connect these reservoirs with their sources and sinks. Methodological limitations have prevented decompositions for realistic flows with non-hydrostatic motions and variable stratification. We present a framework that separates the flow into wave and geostrophic components using the principle that waves have no Eulerian available potential vorticity signature. Starting from new expressions for available energy and potential vorticity conservation, we construct a basis of wave and geostrophic modes, complete and orthogonal with respect to quadratic approximations of the conserved quantities. Using the resulting non-hydrostatic projection operators, the nonlinear equations of motion are expressed as coupled wave and geostrophic equations, quantifying cascade and transfer fluxes of wave and geostrophic energy. We apply the method to non-hydrostatic mid-ocean simulations with geostrophic mean-flow, near-inertial, and tidal forcing. From these experiments, we construct source-sink-reservoir diagrams for exact and quadratic fluxes, quantifying the fluxes between geostrophic and wave components. Because the cascade fluxes obey total energy conservation, we construct energy flow diagrams within the wave and geostrophic reservoirs and diagnose nonlocal transfers. The simulations show a geostrophic inverse cascade, a forward wave cascade, and a direct transfer of geostrophic to wave energy, with no indication of a forward geostrophic cascade. The mean-flow-only simulation shows weak spontaneous wave emission during spin-up, which diminishes to zero. Finally, we evaluate the decomposition by comparing linearized and fully conserved available potential vorticity, finding that errors become significant at scales below 15\\,km.",

Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of \"influencers\" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.",

The method is able to capture the transient development of the cell-free layer (CFL) and the corresponding hematocrit and velocity profiles with the development of the CFL. The CFL thickness and hemorheological hallmarks in microcirculation, such as the Fahraeus Effect and the Fahraeus-Linqvist Effect, are captured and are in good agreement with existing experimental and direct numerical results of blood flows.

A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \\textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\\times$2 up to 5$\\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths.

These engines must transition smoothly between flight regimes and altitudes. Scramjets (supersonic combustion ramjets) play a key role in addressing these challenges. Recent advancements in high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools allow researchers to explore novel designs and improve the feasibility of hypersonic travel. In this work, we analyze a radical-farming type scramjet engine mounted at the University of Queensland's T4 Wind Tunnel at Mach 10. We use the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model, which combines Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in different flow regions. A novel integrated modeling strategy is introduced, coupling the inlet, fuel injectors, combustor, and nozzle for full-scale engine analysis. Hydrogen combustion is modeled using a Finite Rate Chemistry (FRC) approach with a 12-species, 27-reaction mechanism to capture shock-induced chemical kinetics across equivalence ratios of $\\phi = 0.5$ to $0.9$. The Takeno flame index analysis reveals multiple combustion regimes, with ignition occurring in the partially premixed regime. This is supported by Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA), which identifies regions of high chemical sensitivity, correlating with observed hot pockets and providing insights into autoignition and flame stabilization mechanisms. The combination of IDDES and FRC improves the transport of hydrogen to hot pockets, producing combustion patterns that match experimental results.

    "abstract": "While many existing machine learning studies have focused on augmenting Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models for steady or time averaged unsteady flows, this paper takes a first step toward extending such augmentation to time resolved unsteady flows. An unsteady field inversion and machine learning (FIML) method is developed, in which a temporally evolving correction field (beta) is incorporated into the production term of a RANS turbulence model. The inverse problem is solved by optimizing the spatial temporal distribution of beta to minimize the regularized prediction errors. The resulting optimized beta field is then used to train a multi layer neural network that learns the time dependent relationship between local flow features and beta. The approach is demonstrated using the unsteady flow over a NACA0012 airfoil undergoing dynamic stall. Results show that the unsteady FIML model, trained using only the time series of drag data at a given pitch rate, can accurately reproduce the spatial temporal evolution of reference drag, lift, pitching moment, surface pressure, and velocity fields at both identical and different pitch rates. The unsteady FIML is integrated into the open source DAFoam framework, enabling a pathway toward developing accurate and generalizable RANS turbulence models for time resolved unsteady flows.",

    "abstract": "Postulating a minimal discrete quantum of action $S=\\hbar$ and a simple rule for the growth of an oriented graph, we construct a strict hierarchy of temporal layers $C N$ with discrete periods $\\tau_N=N\\hbar/E$. Each layer is specified by its configuration space, symplectic structure, update rule, and emergent symmetry. At $C1$ the state is represented by a single oriented edge with $U(1)$ phase $e^{i E t/\\hbar}$. The transition $C1 \\to C2$ splits the edge into two independent flows, which yields canonical pairs $(x_a,p_a)$, local $U(1)$ invariance, and an effective $(2{+}1)$ metric with signature $(+--)$. The closure $C2 \\to C3$ produces $SU(3)$ connections and an Einstein-Yang-Mills type action. We show that these structures follow from discrete-action principles, and that stochastic graph growth naturally provides mechanisms for decoherence and spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

    "abstract": "Single-crystal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is a promising material for radiation detectors operating in extreme environments, owing to its outstanding radiation hardness. As nuclear and high-energy physics applications demand particle detectors that withstand higher radiation fluences, understanding the damage thresholds and degradation mechanisms of diamond-based detectors is essential. In this study, single-crystal CVD diamond sensors were exposed to fast neutron irradiation at fluences up to $3.3\\times10^{17}$ ${n/cm^2}$. Modules exhibited stable output confirming potential for application in future high-dose radiation environments. The dominant defects were identified as point defects including <100> self interstitials, vacancies, and lattice disorder. Macroscopic defects including nanocavities and cracks were observed with areal densities approaching $10^7$ $cm^{-2}$. The impact of 100 MeV proton irradiation on diamond detector response was quantified by extracting a damage constant of $k^{100 MeV}_{proton}=(1.452\\pm0.006)\\times10^{-18}cm^2/(p\\cdot\\mu m)$ from a linear carrier drift degradation model. The mean free path of carriers was found to exhibit saturation behavior beyond a fluence of $4\\times10^{16}$ ${p/cm^2}$ under 100 MeV proton irradiation. Monte Carlo together with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess irradiation induced defect and its influence on carrier transport. By considering saturation effects and defect-interaction corrections, we develop an enhanced carrier-drift degradation model that accurately captures detector response under high-dose irradiation. Furthermore, the simulation framework was applied to evaluate damage induced by protons and pions on diamond at various energies, yielding results that show better agreement with experimental data than conventional NIEL based estimates.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is considered one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and there is no effective cure for it. Understanding the neuropathological mechanisms underlying AD is essential for identifying early, reliable biomarkers and developing effective therapies. In this paper, we report on a comprehensive multimodal study of AD pathology using the 5xFAD mouse model. We employed light-scattering techniques, Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect nanoscale structural alterations in brain tissues, nuclear components, and mitochondria. To support the light-scattering experiments, behavior, and histopathological studies were conducted. These analyses revealed significant increases in structural heterogeneity and mass density fluctuations in the brains of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. Behavioral assessment demonstrated memory impairment in 5xFAD mice, reflected by a reduced recognition index. Histopathological analysis further revealed increased amyloid beta plaques and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. An increase in structural disorder within brain tissues can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations, likely arising from macromolecular rearrangement driven by amyloid beta aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses as the disease progresses. Our findings suggest that PWS and IPR-derived metrics provide sensitive biophysical indicators of early cellular and subcellular disruption, offering potential as quantitative biomarkers for the detection and progression of AD.",

Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.",

Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters. We also illustrate our results from a dynamic perspective, which provides an explicit geometric picture of the interface modes, and finally present a variety of numerical results to complement the theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Capillary retraction of Herschel-Bulkley ligaments displays a rich set of behaviours that depart significantly from the classical Newtonian picture. We focus here on the low-viscosity regime, where droplet detachment is controlled by the end-pinching mechanism. Using fully resolved axisymmetric simulations, we show that viscoplasticity and shear-dependent rheology reorganize the fundamental routes by which a retracting ligament may pinch off or escape breakup. Four dynamical outcomes are identified: inertial pinch-off, viscous escape driven by an attached vorticity layer, inertial escape caused by vortex-ring detachment, and complete arrest when yielding suppresses motion. These regimes appear in an orderly structure across the rheological parameter space, but their transitions are governed by a single unifying feature of the neck dynamics: whether inertia, viscous diffusion, or yield stress dominates the local collapse. When inertia dominates, the vorticity sheet detaches and rolls into a vortex ring, producing an inertial rebound of the neck. When viscous effects dominate, the vorticity layer remains attached and drives a back-flow that reopens the neck. When yield stress is sufficiently large, both mechanisms are suppressed and the ligament becomes motionless. This framework extends the Newtonian end-pinching and escape mechanisms to viscoplastic fluids and clarifies how non-Newtonian rheology reshapes capillary-driven retraction.",

In the case of the Lanchester model of warfare, the introduction of the collateral damage function was an attempt to turn the model into a more realistic framework for understanding counter-insurgencies and irregular battles. In this article, we focus on addressing the impact of sophisticated collateral damage functions in a modified Lanchester model of combat, which reflects the multifaceted nature of warfare. This analysis shows the possibility of global bifurcations and their repercussions for the combat situation between two players. Finally, we assess the codimension two bifurcation analysis of our system based on the interaction between collateral damage and the effectiveness of targeting insurgents.",

    "abstract": "Adjoint based shape optimization is a powerful technique in fluid-dynamics optimization, capable of identifying an optimal shape within only dozens of design iterations. However, when extended to rarefied gas flows, the computational cost becomes enormous because both the six dimensional primal and adjoint Boltzmann equations must be solved for each candidate shape. Building on the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) for solving the primal Boltzmann model equation, this paper presents a fast converging and asymptotic preserving method for solving the adjoint kinetic equation. The GSIS accelerates the convergence of the adjoint kinetic equation by incorporating solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations, whose constitutive relations include the Newtonian stress law along with higher order terms capturing rarefaction effects. As a result, the method achieves asymptotic preservation (allowing the use of large spatial cell sizes in the continuum limit) while maintaining accuracy in highly rarefied regimes. Numerical tests demonstrate exceptional performance on drag minimization problems for 3D bodies, achieving drag reductions of 34.5% in the transition regime and 61.1% in the slip-flow regime within roughly ten optimization iterations. For each candidate shape, converged solutions of the primal and adjoint Boltzmann equation are obtained with only a few dozen updates of the velocity distribution function, dramatically reducing computational cost compared with conventional methods.",

Our findings are twofold: first, the geographic distribution of collaborations significantly shifted, with a notable increase in cross-border partnerships after 2020, indicating a reduction in the constraints of geographic proximity. Second, despite the expansion of collaboration networks, there was a concerning decline in citation impact, suggesting that the absence of spontaneous in-person interactions-which traditionally foster deep discussions and idea exchange-negatively affected research quality.

We show that the system undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation with strongly different equilibrium shapes when varying the Ohnesorge number, $\\Oh$, which compares viscous and capillary effects. Equilibrium shapes are found to be oblate for sufficiently large $\\Oh$ while, counter-intuitively, they are prolate for low-enough $\\Oh$. The bifurcation diagram is found to contain also two sets of disconnected branches that cannot be obtained by continuation starting from a spherical shape. One set corresponds to bubble shapes expected to be unstable, while the second set comprises a wide region exhibiting stable shapes that might be observed in practice. We then characterize the linear stability of the various branches. In addition to the unstable axisymmetric mode arising at the saddle-node bifurcation, two non-oscillating drift modes are also identified, together with a new unstable non-oscillating mode with azimuthal wave number $m=2$. This mode might be responsible for some type of bubble breakup observed in experiments.",

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.",

Recent developments in quantum algorithms and machine learning offer new opportunities for overcoming the computational barriers inherent in turbulence modeling. Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality. Although constrained by current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, our results demonstrate the potential of quantum machine learning to transform turbulence simulation and lay a solid foundation for scalable, real-time quantum fluid modeling in future quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are widely engineered using surface coatings and chemical treatments to improve interfacial bonding and load transfer. It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization.",

The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.",

    "title": "Effect of subgrid-scale anisotropy on wall-modeled large-eddy simulation of separated flow",
    "abstract": "We examine the role of anisotropic SGS stress in WMLES of flow over a spanwise-uniform Gaussian-shaped bump, with particular emphasis on predicting flow separation. The simulations show that eddy-viscosity-based SGS models often yield non-monotonic predictions of the mean separation bubble size on the leeward side under grid refinement, whereas models incorporating anisotropic SGS stress produce more consistent results across mesh resolutions. To identify where SGS anisotropy is most critical, we selectively introduce anisotropic SGS terms in different regions of the computational domain. The results reveal that the windward side near the bump peak, where a strong FPG occurs, plays a crucial role in determining downstream flow separation. Analysis of the Reynolds stress transport equation shows that fluctuations of anisotropic SGS stress directly modify SGS dissipation and diffusion in this region, thereby altering the Reynolds stress distributions and the onset of downstream separation. Examination of the mean streamwise momentum equation indicates that at coarse resolutions, the mean SGS shear stress dominates, and the differences between the eddy-viscosity-based and anisotropic models remain minor. As the grid is refined, however, resolved Reynolds stresses increasingly govern the near-wall momentum transport, and the influence of SGS stress fluctuations becomes more pronounced, as they determine the SGS dissipation and diffusion of Reynolds stresses. Component-wise analysis of the SGS stress tensor further shows that the improvement arises mainly from including significant normal stress contributions. Finally, an a priori study using filtered DNS of turbulent Couette-Poiseuille flow confirms that wall-bounded turbulence under FPG is highly anisotropic and that anisotropic SGS models provide a more realistic representation of SGS stress anisotropy than eddy-viscosity-based models.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how feature selection algorithms can enable accurate, reference-free classification of materials using sparse-frequency terahertz (THz) reflection spectroscopy. Three classes of feature selection strategies are evaluated. Namely, the filter-based mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), the embedded LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and the wrapper-based SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithms. Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts. These findings highlights that reducing spectral dimensionality through data-driven selection eliminates the need for broadband sources and reference measurements, enabling compact, application-specific THz sensors. This approach offers robust material identification in real-world scenarios such as security screening, non-destructive testing, and environmental monitoring.",

This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.",

We present a multiresolution dataset spanning February 2017--November 2018, combining Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations with Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) wind fields processed using the CMOD5 model. WRF outputs were generated every 30 minutes for three nested domains (9 km, 3 km, 1 km) through 975 short-term simulations. SAR/CMOD5 wind fields are provided at 500 m and 1 km resolution across 104 acquisition dates. Validation shows strong agreement: daily spatial averages of 10 m wind speed yield RMSE and MAE below 3 m/s on over 93% of acquisition days, while more than 91.5% of pixel-level residuals fall within $\\pm$3 m/s. In situ measurements from the Itajaí buoy further confirmed the reliability of both sources.

    "abstract": "Crystalline symmetry offers a powerful tool to realize photonic topological phases, in which additional trivial claddings are typically required to confine topological boundary states. However, the utility of the trivial cladding in manipulating topological waves is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate two topologically distinct kagome photonic crystals (KPCs) based on different crystalline symmetries: \\mathbit{C}_\\mathbf{6}- symmetric KPCs exhibit a quantum spin Hall phase, while \\mathbit{C}_\\mathbf{3}-symmetric KPCs serve as trivial cladding. By tuning the geometric parameter of the trivial cladding, we observe that a pair of topological interface states featured with pseudospin-momentum locking undergoes a phase transition, accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of corner states in a finite hexagonal supercell. Such a geometry-induced band inversion is characterized by a sign change in the Dirac mass of the topological interface states and holds potential for applications such as rainbow trapping. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the corner states, which is a hallmark of higher-order topology, also depend critically on the trivial cladding. Our work highlights the crucial role of trivial claddings on the formation of topological boundary states, and offers a novel approach for their manipulation.",

Linear stress recovery methods, which solve a single geometrically linear equilibrium problem on the imaged, already-loaded geometry, have been validated for static stress estimation, but their robustness to unknown imaging phase remains unexplored. We investigated whether imaging phase materially biases 99th percentile stress recovered linearly, and whether linear recovery agrees with non-linear analysis under matched loads. Two patient-specific AAAs from a public 4D-CTA cohort (Case 1: 5.5% strain; Case 2: 4.5% strain) were analyzed. For each, we analyzed diastolic and synthetic systolic geometry, the latter generated by warping the diastolic mesh via displacements from non-linear hyperelastic analysis. Linear stresses were recovered on both geometries under systolic pressure and compared via 99th-percentile maximum principal stress, stress distributions, and 3D stress differential contours. Linear stresses under pulse pressure were compared against non-linear stresses. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery on diastolic vs synthetic systolic geometries under systolic pressure differed by 8.6% (Case 1) and 3.5% (Case 2), within segmentation uncertainty. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery and non-linear analysis under pulse pressure agreed closely: 0% difference (Case 1) and 1.1% (Case 2), with nearly identical distributions. These findings support linear stress recovery for patient-specific AAA analysis in clinical settings with static single-phase imaging, offering a computationally efficient alternative without compromising accuracy or requiring patient-specific wall properties.",

The algorithm comprises three primary stages: the efficient preparation of an initial turbulent state with a prescribed energy spectrum, its subsequent time evolution via LCHS, and the direct measurement of key turbulence statistics. Our analysis indicates that the algorithm can offer a practical quantum speedup over the classical simulation methods for a sufficiently large computational grid. We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for simulating a minimal instance of non-trivial turbulence with classical validation. The numerical results show excellent agreement with ground-truth solutions, capturing both the qualitative evolution of turbulent fields and the quantitative behavior of statistics, including the Reynolds stresses and the fluctuating velocity spectrum. Despite its linearity, rapidly distorted turbulence captures essential turbulence mechanisms and may inform the development of quantum algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations.

A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.",

The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics. In this work, we present a novel theoretical approach for determining the CFPs. The procedure resembles the traditional extraction path but crucially accounts for the full $\\ket{J,M_J}$ space of an ion configuration with $L=3$ and $S=\\nicefrac{1}{2}$. By demonstrating the extraction procedure using the simplest case of a Ce$^\\text{III}$ 4f$^1$ ion with a crystal-field split $J \\in \\{\\nicefrac{5}{2}, \\nicefrac{7}{2}\\}$ manifold, it is shown for the first time that a unique set of CFPs describes the splitting and mixing both the $J$ manifolds. In fact, this $J/J^\\prime$ mixing is analogous to the ``spin mixing'' in binuclear transition metal complexes. At the employed level of calculation, we demonstrate that there is no spin-orbit coupling influence on the CFP values, contrary to previous beliefs. This work represents the first step of a larger effort in reviewing the theory and extraction procedures of CFPs in f-element complexes.",

    "abstract": "The electronic structure of the ICl+ molecular ion is investigated by using high-level multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method. To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied. Based on the computed transition dipole moments and Franck-Condon Factors, radiative lifetimes for the low-lying vibrational levels of excited states are evaluated.",

It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene.

Parallel optical computing like cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) based offers powerful computational capabilities but also introduces new challenges, particularly concerning dispersion due to the introduction of new frequencies. In this work, we extend existing theories of cascaded MZI systems to develop a generalized model tailored for wavelength-multiplexed parallel optical computing. Our comprehensive model incorporates component dispersion characteristics into a wavelength-dependent transfer matrix framework and is experimentally validated. We propose a computationally efficient compensation strategy that reduces global dispersion error within a 40 nm range from 0.22 to 0.039 using edge-spectrum calibration.

    "abstract": "Estimation of thermal contact resistances between cylinders can be achieved using heating on the cross sections by a laser spot and measurement of the temperature response by IR thermography. This type of measurement makes it possible to characterise contacts in clusters of cylinders to simulate clusters of grains, or the properties of fibrous media in the transverse direction or, under certain conditions, to detect emerging thermal resistances (cracks perpendicular to the observation plane) by IR thermography. Here, the thermal model is simplified because the temperature field in relaxation on either side of the resistance can be considered isothermal with a separation of transfers in the plane and along the thickness. The mathematical model is then analytical (relaxation of a linear system), and the processing of the temperature field can be inversed thanks to the consideration of the logarithm of matrices, useful when studying the propagation of measurement noise. The method proposed in the case of two or three cylinders is a first step and a validation for applications to the study of more complex media (large number of cylinders, granular media).",

    "abstract": "In collisionless plasmas, relaxation of the deviations of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) occurs through particle interactions with electromagnetic fields. In particular, in the Earth's magnetotail, the deviations of the ion VDFs, typically consisting of multiple components, from the equilibrium must be limited to maintain stability of the current sheet. Curvature scattering is a leading candidate mechanism to limit such deviations, but its role remains insufficiently understood. We investigate the limits of ion temperature anisotropy in a magnetotail-like configuration by modeling a quasi-1D current sheet with a finite magnetic field curvature and three ion populations. We derive analytical thresholds for anisotropy based on current sheet stability and validate against spacecraft observations and numerical results. Our findings demonstrate that curvature scattering imposes limits on ion anisotropies, thereby maintaining the stability of the current sheet.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an innovative computational study of domain-based charge transfer that leverages the localized orbitals of pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD). This method enables both directional monitoring and quantitative assessment of charge transfer among donor (D), bridge (B), and acceptor (A) moieties. We applied this approach to a series of newly designed carbazole-based prototypical organic dyes, doping the bridge at positions 1, 2, and 3 with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to generate mono-, di-, and tri-doped variants. Our results demonstrate a clear and progressive enhancement in charge transfer as the degree of nitrogen or oxygen doping increases from mono- to di- to tri-doped systems. For mono-doped dyes, the highest forward charge transfer from donor to bridge to acceptor (D$\\xrightarrow{}$B$\\xrightarrow{}$A) occurs when a heteroatom (N or O) is placed in the terminal ring of the bridge, closer to the acceptor. In di-doped dyes, the largest forward charge transfer is observed when heteroatoms occupy both terminal positions, with one atom (N or S) adjacent to the donor and the other (N) near the acceptor. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the organic dye doped with three nitrogen atoms at the bridge exhibits the most efficient and highest directional donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (42.6\\%), making it the most promising candidate for potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, our calculations predict weak charge separation in all systems, indicating that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor.",

    "abstract": "Modelling migration is complicated, as people move for many reasons. Some leave their country for the first time, others return to places they once called home, or move on to new destinations. However, most models focus only on who arrives, missing the full picture of how migrant populations evolve. We introduce a model for diaspora flows that estimates both arrivals and exits using daily migration flow rates, disaggregated by age and nationality. Drawing on high-resolution administrative data from Austria covering over 1.8 million foreign nationals, the model allocates these movements across more than 2,000 municipalities based on the size of local diaspora communities. We find that exits are not exceptions but a consistent and predictable feature across all groups. Migration rejuvenates Austria's population, as both arriving and departing migrants are younger than the average resident. This effect has distinct age-geography patterns: younger migrants are drawn to cities, while older migrants are more evenly distributed in the country. By capturing both arrivals and exits simultaneously, our approach provides a more comprehensive and interpretable picture of migration dynamics, how populations change over time, and how they are influenced by space, age, and national origins.",

    "abstract": "We develop a weakly nonlinear, multi-mode theory for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) on a time-varying spherical interface, fully incorporating mode couplings and the Bell-Plesset (BP) effects arising from interface convergence. Our model extends prior analyses, which have been largely restricted to static backgrounds, 2D cylindrical geometries, or single-mode initial conditions. We present a framework capable of evolving arbitrary, fully three-dimensional initial perturbations on a dynamic background. At the first order, mode amplitudes respond to the time-varying interface acceleration with an exponential-like growth, in qualitative agreement with classic static results. At second order, nonlinear mode coupling reveals a powerful selection rule: energy is preferentially channeled into axisymmetric (m=0) modes. We find that the BP effects dramatically amplify the instability growth by a few orders of magnitude, with this amplification being even more significant for second order couplings. Despite this strong channeling, the second order amplitudes remain small relative to the first order, validating the perturbative approach. These findings offer new physical insights into time-dependent interface instabilities relevant to applications such as astrophysical shell collapse and inertial confinement fusion, highlighting the uniquely dominant role of axisymmetric modes in BP-driven convergent flows.",

    "abstract": "We study the coupled dynamics of multilayer networks with symmetric (MLs) and asymmetric (MLas) inter-layer connections. The symmetric inter-layer connections arise from a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of different layers. In contrast, asymmetry results from the multiplicity of inter-layer connections, achieved by randomizing the links while preserving their overall density, thereby allowing one-to-many inter-layer connections. We investigate how different types of inter-layer coupling impact the dynamics of non-identical multilayer networks. We find that the specificity of one-to-one inter-layer connections facilitates intra-layer synchronization (ILS). In contrast, for networks with random inter-layer connectivity, ILS depends on how randomness affects intra-layer homomorphism (the set of permutations that preserve the network structure). Furthermore, amplitude death (AD) in MLs is observed at lower connectivity strength and frequency mismatch than the MLas. Moreover, AD in MLs depends on the density and topology, but does not depend on the size of the networks. On the other hand, AD in MLas is influenced by network size in addition to density, topology, and inter-layer mismatches. Moreover, both the MLs and MLas exhibit multi-stability, with the faster layer exhibiting a remanent periodic phase-locked oscillation, irrespective of the topology and inter-layer connectivity. In addition, remnant synchrony between nodes with homomorphic relationships is observed in the slower layer. Overall, we propose that symmetric inter-layer connections should be preferable for achieving intra-layer synchronization-regardless of global synchronization-and for sustaining permanent memory in multilayer networks with mismatched nodes across layers. However, to mitigate AD at low coupling values and layer mismatch, asymmetric inter-layer connectivity is more advantageous.",

The proposed approach addresses the key challenges of model scalability and partial observability by integrating data-driven reduced order modelling, control in a latent space, and state estimation within a unified formulation. A predictive model is constructed via Operator Inference on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition basis, yielding a compact latent representation that captures the dominant system dynamics. State estimation is achieved through an Unscented Kalman Filter, which reconstructs the latent space from sparse and noisy measurements, enabling closed-loop control. The input signals are computed directly in the reduced-order latent space, improving computational efficiency with negligible impact on predictive capability. The methodology is validated on the one- and two-dimensional Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equations, serving as benchmarks for chaotic and spatially-extended systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate stabilisation. Overall, the framework provides a practical approach for nonlinear control of complex, high-dimensional systems where full-state measurements are often inaccessible or infeasible.",

    "abstract": "Improving the efficiency of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has become increasingly urgent with the rapid development of space exploration. To address this issue, the direct intermittent general synthetic iteration (DIG) scheme has recently been proposed to enable DSMC's rapid and accurate convergence to steady-state solutions, even when the cell size is much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes. The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties. Because the Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, the analysis is conducted using the linearized BGK model. It is found that, in the near continuum flow regime, the DIG method asymptotically recovers the Navier Stokes equations when the cell size is O(1), rather than being constrained by the mean free path. Moreover, after a single cycle of DIG evolution, the deviation from the final steady state solution is reduced by more than a factor of five. In the second part of the paper, the Poiseuille flow and hypersonic flow passing over cylinder are investigated using the DIG scheme, with different time step and cell sizes, thereby demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in multiscale flow simulation. Specifically, when the Knudsen number is 0.01, the DIG method is found to be faster than the traditional DSMC method by two orders of magnitude. The performance gain becomes even greater at smaller Knudsen numbers. The proposed method holds great potential for engineering applications.",

Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions.",

    "title": "High-precision luminescence cryothermometry strategy by using hyperfine structure",
    "abstract": "A novel, to the best of our knowledge, ultralow-temperature luminescence thermometry strategy is proposed, based on a measurement of relative intensities of hyperfine components in the spectra of Ho$^{3+}$ ions doped into a crystal. A $^{7}$LiYF$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$ crystal is chosen as an example. First, we show that temperatures in the range 10-35 K can be measured using the Boltzmann behavior of the populations of crystal-field levels separated by an energy interval of 23 cm$^{-1}$. Then we select the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ line of the holmium $^5I_5 \\rightarrow ^5I_7$ transition, which has a well-resolved hyperfine structure and falls within the transparency window of optical fibers (telecommunication S band), to demonstrate the possibility of measuring temperatures below 3 K. The temperature $T$ is determined by a least-squares fit to the measured intensities of all eight hyperfine components using the dependence $I(\\nu) = I_1 \\exp(-b\\nu)$, where $I_1$ and $b = a\\nu + \\frac{\\nu}{kT}$ are fitting parameters and a accounts for intensity variations due to mixing of wave functions of different crystal-field levels by the hyperfine interaction. In this method, the absolute and relative thermal sensitivities grow at $T$ approaching zero as $\\frac{1}{T^2}$.and $\\frac{1}{T}$, respectively. We theoretically considered the intensity distributions within hyperfine manifolds and compared the results with experimental data. Application of the method to experimentally measured relative intensities of hyperfine components of the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ PL line yielded $T = 3.7 \\pm 0.2$ K. For a temperature of 1 K, an order of magnitude better accuracy is expected.",

    "title": "Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.",

    "abstract": "In this Letter, through the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation, we reveal the dynamic mechanism underlying the abnormal polarity effect in SF6 short-gap DC breakdown, as well as a novel criterion for predicting negative breakdown voltage. Using the traditional single-streamer breakdown criterion, the simulated positive breakdown voltage agrees well with experimental measurements, whereas the simulated negative breakdown voltage deviates markedly from the experiments, so the single-streamer breakdown criterion fails to reproduce the abnormal polarity effect observed experimentally. In addressing this, we propose an ion-ion plasma breakdown criterion for negative breakdown voltage. When this novel criterion is applied, the simulated negative breakdown voltage agrees with the experiments and reflects the abnormal polarity effect. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of key physical parameters reveals that, the dynamic mechanism for ion-ion plasma breakdown for negative polarity can be divided into four stages: primary streamer stage, ion accumulation stage, reconstructive ionization stage, and ion-ion plasma propagation stage. Notably, the ion-ion plasma propagation stage is dominated by photoionization-driven negative-ion accumulation rather than conventional impact ionization.",

Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.",

This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Neutron transport inside the reflector tank of the new Brazilian nuclear reactor, called the RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor), is investigated using the stochastic Monte Carlo method. One of the main characteristics of research nuclear reactors is the core power density, which is proportional to the neutron flux generated in the fission reaction. The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 Å to 1.19 Å. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $\\lambda_{peak}$ = 1.18 Å increasing to $\\lambda_{peak}$ = 1.21 Å.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To demonstrate in-vivo imaging with a low-cost, low-field MRI scanner built and operated in Africa, and to show how systematic hardware and software improvements can mitigate the main operational limitations encountered in low-resource environments. Methods: A 46 mT Halbach scanner located at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (Uganda) was upgraded through a complete reorganization of grounding and shielding, installation of new control electronics and open-source user-interface software. Noise performance was quantified using a standardized protocol and in-vivo brain images were acquired with three-dimensional RARE sequences. Distortion correction was implemented using cloud-based reconstructions incorporating magnetic field maps. Results: The revamped system reached noise levels routinely below three times the thermal limit and demonstrated stable operation over multi-day measurements. Three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted brain images were successfully acquired and distortion-corrected with remote GPU-based reconstructions and near real-time visualization through the user interface. Conclusions: The results show that low-cost MRI systems can achieve clinically relevant image quality when electromagnetic noise and power-grid instabilities are properly addressed. This work highlights the feasibility of sustainable MRI development in low-resource settings and identifies stable power delivery and local capacity building as the key next steps toward clinical translation.",

The FPGA processes beam pulses of approximately 200 ns every 1.695 ${\\mu}$s, allowing for continuous monitoring of the extracted spill intensity through fast bunch integration. The system directly controls three quadrupole magnets, which work in conjunction with sextupole magnets to achieve third-order resonant extraction. Furthermore, the board interfaces with Fermilab's Accelerator Control Network (ACNET), enabling operators to modify spill regulation settings in real-time via the control network while providing diagnostic waveforms. These waveforms help operators monitor the process and fine-tune the feedback mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of the board's architecture and its initial progress toward regulating beam extraction. This initial version of the regulation system aims to evaluate baseline performance to inform future system improvements.",

The transport time is investigated in both one- and two-dimensional models with topological non-trivial band structures. The fast transport is inherited with the wavefunction localization, giving a stronger effective coupling strength between the mode and the measurement leads. Also the transport time in one-dimension is independent of the system size. To verify the asertion, we implement a chain of split-ring resonators and their complementary ones with controllable hopping strengths. By performing the measurements on the group delay of non-trivially topological edge states with pulse excitations, the transport time between two edge states is directly observed with the chain length up to $20$. Along the route to harness topology to protect optical information, our experimental demonstrations provide a crucial guideline for utilizing photonic topological devices.",

    "title": "Two-Stream Instability and Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Mode Formation in Coulomb One Component Plasma",
    "abstract": "We investigate the Two-Stream Instability in a strongly coupled plasma using classical molecular dynamics simulations with long-range Coulomb interactions between particles. The nonlinear evolution of the instability is identified by the emergence of a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) mode. Our simulations capture key microscopic effects, such as inter-particle correlations, collisional dynamics, and coherent wave-particle interactions-features often absent in traditional fluid and kinetic models, including Particle-In-Cell and Vlasov approaches. In the linear regime, the instability grows rapidly and saturates within a few tens of plasma periods. As the system transitions into the nonlinear saturation phase, a single BGK mode emerges. This mode (or phase-space hole) becomes dynamically unstable in the nonlinear regime, characterized by a continuous decay of electrostatic energy over time. An energy budget analysis reveals a bump in an otherwise thermal spectrum, indicating the excitation of a coherent mode, further confirmed through a numerical rendering of the dispersion relation. The pairwise interaction plays a crucial role: pronounced instability and BGK mode formation occur with long-range Coulomb forces, while such structures are suppressed under shielded Coulomb interactions. We observe the emergence of a single BGK mode across all coupling strengths in the fluid regime, provided the streaming velocity exceeds a critical threshold.",

These fields, created by the non-collinear superposition of two polarization-shaped pulses of different colors from a supercontinuum polarization pulse shaper, provide electric-field components along all spatial directions. The resulting photoelectron momentum distributions, recorded via velocity map imaging, demonstrate full 3D coherent control of electronic superposition states extending beyond the constraints of planar polarization fields by unlocking all dipole selection rules $\\Delta m = 0,\\pm1$. As an application, 3D pump-probe fields are used to image previously unobserved photoelectron wave packets mapping spin-orbit dynamics of the potassium $3d$ fine structure doublet.

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent experiments, the theoretical study of wave propagation in time varying materials is of current interest. Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.",

To facilitate TMPRT, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D-CRT planning techniques were developed following the guidelines of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial. Plans were evaluated with respect to homogeneity, conformality, and adherence to dose constraints. Deliverability of plans was assessed using in-phantom measurements for absorbed dose accuracy at low dose rates and using EPID for isodose verification. For VMAT only single arc plans were found to be acceptable due to otherwise unacceptably heterogeneous field doses, while for dynamic conformal arcs machine limtations on the number of monitor units per degree require the use of partial arcs for each pulse. Delivery of plans at low dose rates (< 100 MU/min) was accurate with high Gamma pass rates on modern LINACs and moderate pass rates on legacy LINACs, in line with their general performance. Generally, VMAT is preferred to achieve optimal homogeneity, conformality, and organ-at-risk sparing, while the use of 3D-CRT can increase the availability of TMPRT for more patients and clinics.",

This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported.

    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of sheared grazing flow on acoustic propagation in three-dimensional rectangular ducts. We particularly focus on small ducts typical of most experimental impedance eduction facilities, for which the flow profile in the duct cross-section varies significantly. We assess the effect of simplifying this inherent two-dimensional flow profile to either a one-dimensional (2D duct) or uniform flow profile. Three flow profiles are considered, namely (i) the tensorised hyperbolic tangent, (ii) the law-of-the-wall, and (iii) one obtained from a RANS simulation. These flow profiles are used in numerical simulations, based on the solution of the Pridmore--Brown equation, to perform in silico impedance eduction experiments. Results show that realistic flow profiles can be approximated well in ducts by uniform or 2D-duct models provided the bulk Mach number is correctly accounted for, which contrasts with previous findings for more simplistic flow profiles. The key conclusion of this work is that if viscous effects are negligible and acoustic impedance is a good representation of a lined wall with grazing flow, then the simplification to a uniform flow is a reasonable approximation and traditional eduction methods are satisfactorily accurate.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.",

This work introduces a physically principled framework, Diffusion Distance with Personalized PageRank (D-PPR), which unifies static topology with dynamic information flow by modeling nodes as signal sources propagating through the network via Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors. The method quantifies node-pair similarity through the graph Laplacian-governed diffusion distance between their topology-aware signal distributions, thereby bridging microscopic interactions with macroscopic network dynamics. Systematic benchmarking on synthetic (Barabási-Albert, LFR) and seven large-scale real-world networks spanning technology, biology, and social domains demonstrates that D-PPR achieves highly competitive performance, yielding favorable results when compared to representative local and global heuristics, particularly in sparse and modular networks. These findings establish a rigorous foundation for physics-inspired link prediction by revealing that incorporating dynamical processes into structural similarity metrics enables deeper insights into network connectivity patterns, offering both methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives on the interplay between topology and dynamics.",

Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination.",

Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.",

This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices enable liquid biopsy for cancer detection by separating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples based on size, but designing these microfluidic devices requires computationally expensive Navier-Stokes simulations and particle-tracing analyses. While recent surrogate modeling approaches using deep learning have accelerated this process, they often inadequately handle the critical periodic boundary conditions of DLD unit cells, leading to cumulative errors in multi-unit device predictions. This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications.",

Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not exclusive to turbulence. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.",

    "abstract": "We extend the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which is well-studied in the qubit framework, to its qutrit counterpart (which we call qutrit HHL, as opposed to qubit HHL, which is HHL using qubits). We design the circuit for the algorithm and develop a program for its implementation. We test HHL with qutrits for simple matrices and verify the results against the expected outcomes. We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.",

In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.",

In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.",

We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \\pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \\pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60. Training convergence occurs 8.2$\\times$ faster than baseline approaches, completing in 45 minutes versus 370 minutes for QUBO optimization.

    "abstract": "Al1-xScxN has attracted significant interest due to its large remnant polarization and low processing temperature when compared to other ferroelectric material systems. However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate.",

Various families of stable multipole solitons trapped in the trough, from dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones to multi-lobe complexes, are found. The existence domain remains invariant with the increase of the potential's depth. Solitons with a large number N of lobes are stable in a wide parameter region, up to N=48 and even farther. Actually, stable multipole solitons of an arbitrarily high order N can be found, provided that the trough's radius is big enough. The power of stable multipoles is essentially larger in comparison to previously studied models. It is demonstrated analytically and numerically that the application of a phase torque initiates stable rotation of the multipole complexes. Thus, we put forward an effective scheme for the stabilization of multipole solitons with an arbitrary high number of lobes, including rotating ones, which offers new possibilities for manipulating complex light beams.",

We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\\sim 3\\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth. The upcoming Ariel space mission will conduct an unprecedented statistical survey of cloud cover on hot Jupiters via the simultaneous measurement of $\\sim 100$ infrared phase curves and optical secondary eclipses.

Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2.

Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects.",

    "abstract": "The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

    "abstract": "Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.",

The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($\\phi_\\Delta$) and absorption maxima ($\\lambda_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($\\phi_\\Delta$=0.85, $\\lambda_{max}$=650nm).",

    "abstract": "The nature of the compact objects within the supposed \"lower mass gap\" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.",

However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

    "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of global autonomous driving technology, the demand for its core sensing hardware, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), is escalating. As the light source part of the LiDAR system, lasers, particularly the cutting-edge Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL), have correspondingly attracted extensive research attention. The conventional manual design and optimization of PCSEL typically require expertise in semiconductor physics and months of dedicated effort to achieve satisfactory results. While AI-driven approaches can expedite this process, laser designers still need to invest time in learning the AI algorithms involved. Meanwhile Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their powerful reasoning abilities, can effectively comprehend natural language and provide constructive feedback in multi-turn dialogues. They have already demonstrated potential to assist humans in scientific fields such as robotics design and chemical discovery. A question naturally arises is: Can LLMs transform the lasers design process? This paper proposes a novel human-AI co-design paradigm to show that LLMs can guide the laser design and optimization process both conceptually and technically. Specifically, by simply having conversations, GPT assisted us with writing both Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation code and deep reinforcement learning (RL) code to acquire the optimized PCSEL solution, spanning from the proposition of ideas to the realization of algorithms. Given that GPT will perform better when given detailed and specific prompts, we break down the PCSEL design problem into a series of sub-problems and converse with GPT by posing open-ended heuristic questions rather than definitive commands. We achieved a significant milestone towards self-driving laboratories, that is, a fully automated AI-driven pipeline, for laser design and production.",

To this end, we show that it is possible to follow two ways: one combines Haynsworth and Courant-Fischer theorems with a corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem, the other combines two twin theorems extending Cauchy's interlacing theorem, together with the abovementioned corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem. These derivations allow us to provide an upper bound for the electronic charge that is effectively displaced during the molecular electronic transition from one electronic quantum state to another. This quantity can be regarded as the neat charge that has been transferred during the transition. Our derivations ultimately show that this boundary value can be determined from a simple singular value decomposition and at most two matrix trace-computing operations.",

The model can be reduced to the ideal MHD model with both the linear dispersion relation and the nonlinear ponderomotive force in theory and simulation. The model is used for the verification and validation of simulating internal kink modes in the DIII-D tokamak with accurate calculations of equilibrium parallel current and compressible magnetic perturbation. A large simulation database has been generated to train a surrogate model to predict the kink instability.

The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.",

However, rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission in MoSe2 monolayers independent of excitation polarization. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of ~13. Our work could facilitate the development of ultracompact chiral classical and quantum light sources.",

Previous methods still face significant challenges: traditional computational methods are often computationally complex and their effectiveness is hard to guarantee; deep learning methods rely heavily on datasets, and the complexity of network training makes them difficult to apply in practical field scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a neural network that has only 2464 learnable parameters, which is hundreds or even thousands of times lower than that of the current mainstream deep learning networks. And its parameter constraints rely on priors rather than requiring training data. We proposed two types of priors: the local prior and the global variance prior for self-supervised learning, and put forward low-scale learning to further enhance its performance in noise processing. We validated our method on both synthetic and field data, and the results indicate that our proposed approach effectively attenuates random noise.",

By systematically analyzing the effects of overhang length, we reveal previously unreported multi-maxima mode shapes and demonstrate how geometric tuning can controllably shift resonant frequencies. Furthermore, we establish a quantitative relationship between modal sensitivity and cantilever-surface coupling strength, providing actionable design principles for optimizing AFM cantilever performance. Our results not only reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations but also offer practical guidelines for tailoring cantilever geometry to achieve specific frequency responses in applications such as nanomechanical imaging and surface property mapping.

The theory of averaging is used to compare the nonautonomous model and its time-averaged version. We analyse the influence of the qualitative properties of the time-dependent coefficients and develop physically significant error estimates close to the upper attracting solution.

However, during the charging process, the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode affects the performance and durability of VFRBs. The evolution of hydrogen bubbles causes the loss of effective reaction area and blocks the transport of reactants. We employ the lattice Boltzmann method to investigate the two-phase flow transport in the negative electrode of VRFBs. Systematic parametric analyses reveal that increased gas production leads to uneven gas removal from the electrode, while an optimal flow rate can effectively remove bubbles and reduce external pumping energy. Additionally, increasing the compression ratio hinders gas removal but enhances electrode electrical conductivity. Overall, the present study provides valuable mechanistic insights into bubble generation at the negative electrode of VRFBs and offers a theoretical reference for designing and optimizing VRFBs.",

First, we incorporate a physically consistent cloud cover parameterization -- derived from storm-resolving simulations via symbolic regression, preserving interpretability while enhancing accuracy -- into the ICON global atmospheric model. Second, we apply the gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimizer to automatically recalibrate the hybrid model against Earth observations, tuning in nested stages (2-, 7-, 30- and 365-day runs) to ensure stability and tractability. The tuned hybrid model substantially reduces long-standing biases in cloud cover -- particularly over the Southern Ocean (by 75%) and subtropical stratocumulus regions (by 44%) -- and remains robust under +4K surface warming.

    "abstract": "We present an application of the Portable Diagnostic Package (PDP) on the Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM), which integrates an optical emission spectroscopy (OES) system and an active Thomson scattering (TS) system. Due to the designed portability of our system, we realized the installation of the PDP OES and TS measurements on WHAM in $\\sim$6 months. The OES system facilitates a comprehensive impurity line survey and enables flow measurements through the Doppler effect observed on impurity lines. Notably, plasma rotation profiles were successfully derived from doubly charged carbon lines. In addition, the TS system enabled the first measurements of the electron temperature in commissioning plasmas on WHAM. These successes underscore the diagnostic package's potential for advancing experimental plasma studies.",

    "abstract": "The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), proposed in 2000, has become a foundational tool in traffic flow modeling, renowned for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to capture diverse traffic dynamics. Over the past 25 years, IDM has significantly advanced car-following theory and found extensive application in intelligent transportation systems, including driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle control. However, IDM's deterministic framework and simplified assumptions face limitations in addressing real-world complexities such as stochastic variability, driver heterogeneity, and mixed traffic conditions. This paper provides a systematic review and critical reflection on IDM's theoretical foundations, academic influence, practical applications, and model extensions. While highlighting IDM's contributions, we emphasize the need to extend the model into a modular and extensible framework. Future directions include integrating stochastic elements, human behavioral insights, and hybrid modeling approaches that combine physics-based structures with data-driven methodologies. By reimagining IDM as a flexible modeling basis, this paper aims to inspire its continued development to meet the demands of intelligent, connected, and increasingly complex traffic systems.",

While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.",

Using a search algorithm instead of a stochastic data-driven generator, SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models at exploring synthetically accessible analogs while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated into existing molecular property-optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible analogs with minimal loss in property scores. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Riemann solvers are widely used for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, including those of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, due to the nonlinearity and complexity of MHD, obtaining accurate and robust numerical solutions to MHD equations is non-trivial, and it may be challenging for an approximate MHD Riemann solver to preserve the positivity of scalar variables, particularly when the plasma \\b{eta} is low. As we have identified that the inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and magnetic energy may be at least partly responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar variables, we propose a consistency condition for calculating the intermediate energies within the Riemann fan and implement it in HLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thereby alleviating erroneous magnetic field solutions that break scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type scheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically reducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, although sacrificing the contact-resolving capability, and (II) for the HLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a three-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more consistent with our other assumptions. The proposed schemes perform better in numerical examples with low plasma \\b{eta}. Moreover, we explained the energy error introduced during time integration.",

    "abstract": "This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature conditions (outdoor Tmax = 42.9 C) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024. Daytime measurements indicated reduced air temperature (AT), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and wind speed (V), together with elevated relative humidity (RH) in the underground space. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) in the underground was consistently lower during peak hours (08:00-16:00), with the maximum difference in PET between pedestrian and underground levels being 11-11.9 C. Higher pedestrian-level PET at L1 was attributed to reduced greenery and shading, and decrement factors indicated greater thermal dampening at L2 (0.197) than at L1 (0.308). Sensitivity analysis showed that MRT was the most influential factor (S1/ST = 0.59-0.72) for aboveground spaces, followed by AT (0.13-0.26). In contrast, underground PET was mainly affected by metabolic rate (MET) (0.63-0.65), followed by RH (0.14-0.20) and V (0.08-0.18). Partial dependence analysis revealed that a 1 met increase in MET raised PET by 1.6 C, whereas a 1 m/s increase in V reduced PET by 1.5-2.2 C in the underground space. Due to cooler and more stable thermal conditions, underground spaces have higher tolerance for intensive physical activities. By buffering fluctuations in AT and MRT, underground environments can significantly alleviate heat stress and provide passive cooling shelter during daytime heat waves. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence to support underground space design in hot-humid climates and offers insights for sustainable urban heat mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Reduced-order models (ROMs) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error accumulation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman-inspired loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.",

To achieve this, we introduce two auxiliary models to assist in encoder training and adopt a heterogeneous model structure to prevent shortcut learning, enabling the extraction of more generalizable and effective linear features.

    "abstract": "Dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media is ubiquitous in real-world settings, yet it remains a defining unsolved problem as rapid spatiotemporal fluctuations overwhelm standard reconstruction pipelines that often rely on speckles with high signal-to-noise ratio. Existing approaches fall into two categories. Guidestar-based methods employ a guidestar to recover the system transfer function; however, in dynamic media, the speckle decorrelates rapidly, making the calibration quickly invalid. Guidestar-free methods infer information from speckle statistics, but rapid changes and noise often break phase retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NeOTF, a guidestar-free and neural-representation-based OTF retrieval method that enables dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media. By optimizing this neural representation with only a few speckle images from unknown objects, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF without a guidestar. We experimentally demonstrate robust dynamic imaging through scattering with NeOTF at extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and broadband incoherent illumination (up to 300 nm spectral bandwidth) scenarios, and we numerically validate its dynamic imaging performance in time-varying scattering media leveraging spatio-temporal memory effect. Finally, we discuss and analyze its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities across anisotropic scattering media. These results establish NeOTF's promise as a practical and robust solution for dynamic imaging through scattering media. Open-sourced code and models are available at this https URL .",

    "abstract": "Politics around the world exhibits increasing polarization, demonstrated in part by rigid voting configurations in institutions like legislatures or courts. The crux of polarization is separation along a unidimensional ideological axis, an example of a statistical physics problem showing emergent collective order. Thus, we extend a foundational, statistical physics framework, restricted Boltzmann machines, to model institutional voting. The models are minimally parameterized, fit voting data well, and have parameters that transparently give vote probabilities -- all points in contrast to standard approaches. To obtain the model, we account for multi-dimensional voter preferences and the context in which such preferences are expressed to disentangle individual from collective contributions; for example, legislative bills can negotiate multiple issues, whose appeal adds up or competes for individual votes. With the example of U.S. Senate voting, we find that senators have multi-dimensional preferences, and, as one consequence, non-polarized coalitions coexist with polarized ones. Additionally, polarization is predominantly explained by fewer votes that elicit bipartisan coalitions. We show that these accounts can be consistent, if far more parsimonious, than emergent order from interactions. This highlights the collective choice of the content and the rules of voting as essential to the ebb and flow of polarization, which is naturally accounted for by a statistical physics approach.",

In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

We examine the effect of the transverse magnetic field on the base flow and long wave instability of a two-layer system consisting of conductive liquid and non-conductive gas. Both perfectly insulating and perfectly conducting boundaries are considered. To capture the behavior at small but finite wavenumbers, the conventional first-order long-wave stability analysis is extended to higher order terms. Using mercury-air system as a representative test case, the results demonstrate distinct and non-similar base flow and disturbance profiles, as well as different stability maps for insulating versus conducting boundaries. The stability diagrams reveal a non-monotonic influence of the magnetic field on flow stability, showing that, in addition to its expected stabilizing effect, the field can also induce destabilization under certain conditions. Inspection of the disturbance profiles indicates that despite the strong damping of mercury flow by the magnetic field, interaction of the two fluids at the interface and the shear-induced instabilities in the gas layer dominate and can lead to flow destabilization as the magnetic field strength increases.",

    "abstract": "The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct effective mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.",

For this purpose, we derive the Kármán-Howarth-Monin equation which accounts for the variations of density and viscosity across the two phases together with the effect of surface tension. We consider both conventional and phase conditional averaging operators. This framework is applied to numerical data from detailed simulations of forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence covering different values for the liquid volume fraction, the liquid/gas density ratio, the Reynolds, and Weber numbers. We confirm the existence of an additional transfer term due to surface tension. Part of the kinetic energy injected at large scales is transferred into kinetic energy at smaller scales by classical non-linear transport while another part is transferred to surface energy before being released back into kinetic energy, but at smaller scales. The overall kinetic energy transfer rate is larger than in single phase flows. Kinetic energy budgets conditioned in a given phase show that the scale-by-scale transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to pressure is a gain (loss) of kinetic energy for the lighter (heavier) phase. Its contribution can be dominant when the gas volume fraction becomes small or when the density ratio increases. Building on previous work, we hypothesize the existence of a pivotal scale above which kinetic energy is stored into surface deformation and below which the kinetic energy is released by interface restoration. Some phenomenological predictions for this scale are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The kappa plane-wave vacuum is a family of kinematically defined quantum states whose thermal properties are well understood, but whose physical origin has remained obscure. In this paper we provide a concrete dynamical realization of this vacuum, showing that it is physically and operationally equivalent to the quantum state produced on future null infinity by a mirror following the Carlitz-Willey (CW) trajectory. The equivalence is established through a three-pronged analysis: we demonstrate that the two constructions share identical Bogoliubov squeeze parameters, identical nonlocal thermal kernels in their Wightman functions, and identical Planckian responses of an Unruh-DeWitt detector. This result anchors an abstract kinematic construction in a well-understood dynamical model, identifying the parameter $\\kappa$ with the physical scale that governs the Carlitz-Willey trajectory. In the final part of the paper we characterize, within the moving-mirror framework, the complete class of mirror trajectories that reproduce the same asymptotic thermal kernel on $\\mathscr I^+_R$, and show that only the purely exponential CW trajectory generates a constant, stationary flux.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.",

    "abstract": "In this communication, we examine new formalisms for the construction of the external space when correlating reference wavefunctions built from nonorthogonal determinant expansions. Defining the external space in nonorthogonal approaches is challenging, as every substitution from the reference wavefunction can potentially mix both internal and external configurations. As a result, post-nonorthogonal methods are plagued by internal contamination and linear dependencies in the external space, which may lead to correlation double counting that results from overlap of the external and reference spaces. Removal of these internal configurations and orthonormalization of the excited space basis can be computationally expensive. In particular, as the excitation operators cannot be subdivided by their action on orbital subspaces, the external space cannot be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets as is possible in orthogonal methods. To resolve these issues, we propose both uncontracted and internally-contracted approaches based on a natural excitation framework that allows for reduced scaling, more straightforward separation of excitation types that lead to external and internal spaces, and allows for a facile translation of orthogonal methods to a nonorthogonal framework. Several proofs and a numerical demonstration using vanadium monohydride (VH) are provided to illustrate the viability of the proposed approach, using a method-agnostic presentation to highlight the generality of the approach.",

This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate \"helicity streams\" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!6$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\\!\\rightarrow\\!7$ process $gg\\!\\rightarrow\\!t\\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively.

In particular, the reconstruction is facilitated when the sensing matrix is i.i.d. random, enabling strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms. However, its applicability is restricted by excessive computational costs. In this paper, we propose structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We reduce the complexity from quadratic to log-linear at no cost in reconstruction performance. Through a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular-value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.",

We report here experimental results of walking droplets interacting with supercritical Faraday waves with dimensionless acceleration of approximately 7.7, where the onset of Faraday instability occurs at dimensionless acceleration 6.3, in flat bath topography. Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in the subcritical Faraday regime.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&D program at the EIC.",

Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.",

However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.",

Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency.

This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.",

A plastic Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact and high-resolution solution. However, constructing a large-area SciFi detector demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, we present a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm, enabling up to $N_{\\textrm{SiPM}}^{\\textrm{max}}=C^{2}_{N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ SiPM channels to be read out using only ${N_{\\textrm{ele}}}$ electronic channels. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the choice of appropriate diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. A multiplexed SciFi detector module comprising 21 SiPM channels read out through 7 electronic channels are constructed. Electronic tests show that this module exhibits low crosstalk between electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range from $\\sim$10 to 122 photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further show that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to the direct (per SiPM channel) readout. These results verify that the proposed method provides a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.",

The SR phenomenon involves the detection of weak signals by adding an optimal amount noise to a non-linear system. This is linked with Kramers' escape problem, which deals with the escape of a particle undergoing Brownian motion over an energy barrier. The position of the particle is analogous to the polarisation dynamics of a ferroelectric. Within this framework, we numerically investigate SR in single domain ferroelectrics using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. In addition, we use a model for multidomain ferroelectrics to demonstrate feasibility in real world applications. Our results show that SR in ferroelectrics is promising for the purpose of weak signal detection, given that these materials are widely used for various applications in the semiconductor industry.",

    "title": "Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature",
    "abstract": "Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schrödinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.",

Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\\leftrightarrow \\,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.",

    "abstract": "High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Matérn covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.",

    "abstract": "Each year, the United States Congress considers thousands of legislative proposals to select bills to present to the US President to sign into law. Naturally, the decision processes of members of Congress are subject to peer influence. In this paper, we examine the effect on bill passage of accrued influence between US Congress members in the US House of Representatives. We explore how the influence of a bill's cosponsors affects the bill's outcome (specifically, whether or not it passes in the House). We define a notion of influence by analyzing the structure of a network that we construct using cosponsorship dynamics. We award `influence' between a pair of Congress members when they cosponsor a bill that achieves some amount of legislative success. We find that properties of the bill cosponsorship network can be a useful signal to examine influence in Congress; they help explain why some bills pass and others fail. We compare our measure of influence to off-the-shelf centrality measures and conclude that our influence measure is more indicative of bill passage.",

The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics.

Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province.

To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics-average daily tweet count, and account age-can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects differ depending on the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.",

We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.",

    "abstract": "Metal hydrides are promising solid-state carriers for the integrated hydrogen economy, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality. However, their conventional synthesis relies on external sources of high-purity H2, thereby linking storage directly to energy-intensive production processes. Here, we transform this paradigm by introducing an acid-mediated \"controllable hydrogen embrittlement\" strategy for the direct and efficient synthesis and functionalization of metal hydrides under mild conditions. This approach leverages in situ hydrogen generation and defect engineering during the reaction of bulk metals with acid, enabling the preparation of over 20 high-purity hydrides. Using diamond anvil cell experiments, we establish a quantitative criterion, |Delta Peq| > Delta Pph, which reveals the key mechanism governing hydride formation and stability, and guides the synthesis of challenging targets such as LiH. This method not only significantly lowers the energy footprint and economic cost of hydride synthesis by eliminating the need for high-pressure H2 and enabling the use of renewable feedstocks but also creates defect-rich, active hydrides. As a demonstration, an engineered titanium hydride achieves an outstanding current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for NH3 in the nitrate electroreduction reaction, while maintaining consistently high performance across a wide operating window, showcasing the stability conferred by enhanced H- transport. This work redefines hydrogen embrittlement as a powerful tool for synthesis and functionalization, establishing a material platform that integrates hydrogen capture, storage, and conversion, and thereby opening a novel pathway to unify the fragmented hydrogen energy chain.",

Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications. In the latter example, both closed and open quantum systems are discussed.",

In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent and emerging applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.

    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.",

The analysis uncovers distinct microscopic origins for the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes: the $E_g$ splitting is governed by MBC and is accurately described by our first-principles scheme, whereas the $E_u$ splitting is enhanced by the Fano resonance, consistent with its asymmetric spectral profile. Leveraging this framework, we further predict several candidates with chiral-phonon splitting. Our results establish a predictive route for identifying and understanding phonon magnetism, chiral phonons, and related Hall-type lattice responses from first principles.",

    "abstract": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $\\delta B/B_0\\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

    "abstract": "We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactions can produce many important medical radioisotopes - including $^{32}$P, $^{60}$Co, $^{64}$Cu, $^{89}$Sr, $^{90}$Y, $^{89}$Zr, $^{99}$Mo/$^{99\\mathrm{m}}$Tc, $^{103}$Pd, $^{111}$In, $^{117}$In/$^{117\\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{123}$I, $^{125}$I, $^{131}$I, $^{133}$Xe, $^{153}$Sm, $^{166}$Ho, $^{177}$Lu, $^{188}$Re, and $^{192}$Ir-and emerging isotopes such as $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Ru/$^{103\\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{103}$Pd/$^{103\\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{119}$Sb, $^{124}$I, $^{155}$Tb, $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\\mathrm{m}}$Pt, and $^{225}$Ac with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical separation of the product. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.",

    "abstract": "POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2$\\sim$10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\\times$ 26 $\\mu$m$^2$ charge-collecting window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0$\\sim$4 ke$^{-}$, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\\mu$V/e$^{-}$, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e$^{-}$, a sensitive area exceeding 3.69 cm$^2$, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.05 keV source, and a count rate saturated at 15 k counts$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}$$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$ when tested at 5.40 keV.",

To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.",

Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.",

Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged.",

This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $\\epsilon$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $\\kappa$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $\\epsilon$ and an analogue of the partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$, as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Z}\\kappa^2 }{\\epsilon T}\\right)$.

Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware.

    "abstract": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally invalidates the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading topological diagnostics into a crisis. While the non-Bloch polarization $P_{\\beta}$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_{\\beta}$ and the entanglement polarization $\\chi$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_{\\beta} \\equiv \\chi(\\tilde{H})\\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $\\chi(\\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.",

This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth. In particular, we show that, for Clifford+T circuits of T-depth $O(\\log(n))$, deciding ENIC is NP-hard. This effectively rules out the possibility, for Clifford+T circuits of logarithmic T-depth, of either efficient ENIC or efficient gate-teleportation based computational indistinguishability obfuscation, unless P=NP.",

We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians.

One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of Çakan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries.",

    "abstract": "The measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy are quantifiers of the distinguishability of two quantum states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$. They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or Rényi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $\\beta$-smooth and $\\gamma$-strongly convex / concave, where $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060 ], and for well conditioned states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, these algorithms are notably faster.",

    "abstract": "Accurately resolving many-body satellite features in molecular core-level spectra requires theoretical approaches that capture electron correlation both efficiently and systematically. The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.",

In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.",

We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \\pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \\pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60.

    "abstract": "The linear and phase insensitive absorption of a single quanta via coherent interactions with a saturable system, even a single ground state qubit, is sufficient to deterministically generate quantum non-Gaussian states in an oscillator, even stimulated merely by increasing thermal oscillator energy. However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments.",

Our basic strategy lowers the cost from \\( O(n^{3/2}) \\) to \\( O(n^{5/4}) \\), and refined strategies achieve \\( O(n \\log n) \\)which is a space lower bound within this model. Simulations demonstrate the resulting time-space trade-offs and resource scaling. Moreover, we construct and compile quantum circuits that factor \\( N = 35 \\), verifying the effectiveness of our method through noisy simulations.

We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle.

By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it.

In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s.

    "title": "Tunable Bands in 1D Fractional Quantum Media",
    "abstract": "Fractional calculus has become an essential framework in geophysics, optics, and biological systems to capture long-range correlations and anomalous transport. In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schrödinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\\pm \\pi/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\\pm0.01$ as $q \\to 1$, demonstrating that the Lévy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Blocks composed of {CNOT, Rz} are ubiquitous in modern quantum applications, notably in circuits such as QAOA ansatzes and quantum adders. After compilation, many of them exhibit large CNOT counts or depths, which lowers fidelity. Therefore, we introduce HOPPS: a SAT-based hardware-aware optimal phase polynomial synthesis algorithm that could generate {CNOT, Rz} blocks with CNOT count or depth optimality. Sometime {CNOT, Rz} blocks are large, such as in QAOA ansatzes, HOPPS's pursuit of optimality limits its scalability. To address this issue, we introduce an iterative blockwise optimization strategy: large circuits are partitioned into smaller blocks, each block is optimally refined, and the process is repeated for several iterations. Empirical results show that HOPPS is more efficient comparing with existing near optimal synthesis tools. Used as a peephole optimizer, HOPPS reduces the CNOT count by up to 50.0% and the CNOT depth by up to 57.1% under OLSQ. For large QAOA circuit, after mapping by Qiskit, circuit can be reduced CNOT count and depth by up to 44.4% and 42.4% by our iterative blockwise optimization.

We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.",

The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.",

The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif.

Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T.",

Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era.

    "abstract": "We construct an ontological model for the theory known as bilocal classical theory this http URL . To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from this http URL which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in this http URL is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself.",

    "abstract": "Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})|d/\\epsilon^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $\\epsilon$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/\\epsilon^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.",

We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound.",

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement.",

    "abstract": "Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \\SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \\SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \\SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.",

While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.",

Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.",

Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.",

At $C1$ the state is represented by a single oriented edge with $U(1)$ phase $e^{i E t/\\hbar}$. The transition $C1 \\to C2$ splits the edge into two independent flows, which yields canonical pairs $(x_a,p_a)$, local $U(1)$ invariance, and an effective $(2{+}1)$ metric with signature $(+--)$. The closure $C2 \\to C3$ produces $SU(3)$ connections and an Einstein-Yang-Mills type action.

By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling.

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.",

Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality.

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.",

    "abstract": "Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.",

    "abstract": "We study the Wigner kernel and the Gabor matrix associated with the propagators of a broad class of linear evolution equations, including the complex heat, wave, and Hermite equations. Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation is analyzed via Hörmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane, reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow. The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.",

In particular, the one-way steerability, Bell non-locality, entanglement, and purity in two qubits are our main focus. We also address the weak measurement protocol on the dynamics of quantum correlations and purity of the state. Our results show that the gravitational cat states have a reliable and better capacity to preserve quantum correlations and remain one of the good resources for the deployment of quantum information processing protocols. Additionally, two independent channels are also employed and it is observed that only the weaker coupling regimes are effective in preserving quantum correlations. Notably, in terms of non-Markovian dynamics implication, quantum correlations are found to be longer preserved because of the information feedback phenomenon between the system and environment. Finally, we present a brief analysis to extend our gravitational model to include the electrostatic notion, providing insight into the key differences between the considered configurations.",

In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between Alice's quadratures $X$ and Bob's measurements $Y$, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value $I(X;Y) - I(E;Y)$, which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection.",

An implementational convenience can be that non-identity single-qubit Hermitian gates are equivalent to $\\pi$ rotations up to a global phase. We show that a gate set comprised of $\\pi$ rotations about two fixed axes, along with the CNOT gate, is universal for quantum computation. Moreover, we show that two $\\pi$ rotations can transform the axis of any multi-controlled unitary, a special case being a single CNOT sufficing for any controlled $\\pi$ rotation. These gates simplify the process of circuit compilation in view of their Hermitian nature.

By coupling the phonons of a mechanical resonator to the photons in a high quality cavity, control of increasingly macroscopic objects has become feasible. In such systems, state manipulation of the mechanical mode is achieved by driving the cavity. To be able to achieve high drive powers the system is typically designed such that it remains in a linear response regime when driven. A nonlinear response and especially bistability in a driven cavity is often considered detrimentally to cooling and state preparation in optomechanical systems and is avoided in experiments. Here we show, that with an intrinsic nonlinear cavity backaction cooling of a mechanical resonator is feasible operating deeply within the nonlinear regime of the cavity. With our theory taking the nonlinearity into account, precise predictions on backaction cooling can be achieved even with a cavity beyond the bifurcation point, where the cavity photon number spectrum starts to deviate from a typical Lorentzian shape.",

Everything that suitably interacts with the Alices foliates in turn, generating worlds which, for all practical purposes, remain distinct and autonomous. At spacelike separation, an analogous yet independent process occurs to Bob when he measures his particle, locally differentiating him and his surroundings into two non-interacting instances. To confirm the violation of Bell inequalities, Alice and Bob must further interact to produce a record of the joint outcomes. The record arises from the two local worlds of Alice, and those of Bob, and foliates into four instances: '00', '01', '10' and '11'. The outcomes that win the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt (CHSH) game sum to a measure of $\\cos^2(\\pi/8)$.",

We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature.

Its efficacy is demonstrated by preparing spin-squeezed states in an open collective spin model governed by a linear control field. Inspired by Darwinian evolution, the algorithm iteratively refines control sequences using crossover, mutation, and elimination strategies, starting from a coherent spin state within a dissipative and dephasing environment. We rigorously benchmark our method against constant control protocols and reinforcement learning, demonstrating competitive and robust performance. Furthermore, we showcase the GA's versatility by directly optimizing for metrologically relevant squeezing, achieving scalable performance, even in the presence of dissipation and thermal noise. The proposed strategy demonstrates a high state-preparation fidelity, exceeding 0.99, and provides a long time window for maintaining the spin squeezed state, even under dissipative conditions. We discuss feasible experimental implementations and potential extensions to alternative quantum systems, and the adaptability of the GA module.

This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\\mathcal{O}(\\sim \\mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.",

Traditional methods, like quantum state tomography (QST), necessitate a full reconstruction of the density matrix for a given system and demand resources that scale exponentially with system size. We propose an alternative strategy that reduces the required information by combining multicopy measurements with artificial neural networks (ANNs), resulting in a 67\\% reduction in measurement requirements compared to QST. We have successfully measured two-qubit quantum correlations of Bell states subjected to a depolarizing channel (resulting in Werner states) and an amplitude damping channel (leading to Horodecki states) using the multicopy approach on real quantum hardware. Our experiments, conducted with transmon qubits on IBMQ processors, quantified the violation of Bell's inequality and the negativity of two-qubit entangled states. We compared these results with those obtained from the standard QST approach and applied a maximum likelihood method to mitigate noise. We trained ANNs to estimate entanglement and nonlocality measures using optimized sets of projections identified through Shapley's (SHAP) analysis for the Werner and Horodecki states. The ANN output, based on this reduced set of projections, aligns well with expected values and enhances noise robustness. This approach simplifies and improves the error-robustness of multicopy measurements, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear equation analysis. It represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted quantum measurements, making practical implementation on current quantum hardware more feasible.",

In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method-a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques-that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies' strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches.

    "abstract": "Digital quantum simulation (DQS) has emerged as a powerful approach to investigate complex quantum systems using digital quantum computers. Such systems, like many-particle bosonic systems and intricate optical experimental setups, pose significant challenges for classical simulation methods. In this paper, we utilize a general formalism for the DQS of bosonic systems, which consists of mapping bosonic operators to Pauli operators using the Gray code, in order to simulate interferometric variants of Afshar's experiment -- an intricate optical experiment -- on IBM's quantum computers. We investigated experiments analogous to Afshar's double-slit experiment performed by Unruh and Pessoa Júnior, exploring discussions on the apparent violation of Bohr's complementarity principle when considering the entire experimental setup. Based on the aforementioned experiments, we construct a variation of a delayed-choice setup. We also explore another experiment starting with a two-photon initial state. Finally, we analyze these experiments within the framework of an updated quantum complementarity principle, which applies to specific quantum state preparations and remains consistent with the foundational principles of Quantum Mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.",

We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.",

In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength.

If a vertex $v$ in the tree of depth $D$ is computed in $t_v$ steps from its parent, then we show that detection of a marked vertex requires $\\text{O}(\\sqrt{TD})$ queries to the steps of the computing procedures, where $T = \\sum_v t_v^2$. This framework provides an easy and convenient way to re-obtain a number of other quantum frameworks like variable time search, quantum divide & conquer and bomb query algorithms. The underlying algorithm is simple, explicitly constructed, and has low poly-logarithmic factors in the complexity. As a corollary, this gives a quantum algorithm for variable time search with unknown times with optimal query complexity $\\text{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log \\min(n,t_{\\max})})$, where $T = \\sum_i t_i^2$ and $t_{\\max} = \\max_i t_i$ if $t_i$ is the number of steps required to compute the $i$-th variable. This resolves the open question of the query complexity of variable time search, as the matching lower bound was recently shown by Ambainis, Kokainis and Vihrovs (TQC'23).

The positive-semidefinite matrices form a convex cone that has extremal elements of rank 1. But, convex conic subsets resulting from the presence of linear constraints allow extremal elements of rank >= 2. The problem of deciding when a matrix is rank-1 generated, i.e, a sum of rank-1 positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrices, has been studied extensively in optimization theory. This rank-1 generated property acts as an entanglement criterion, and we use this property to find novel classes of PPT (Positive under partial transposition) entangled states. We do this by mapping some faces of PPT density matrices to convex cones that are not rank-1 generated. We show that all separable states map to a rank-1 generated matrix. In general, the same is not true for the corresponding mapping of PPT entangled states. We also extend this approach to construct PPT entangled edge states. Finally, we provide witnesses that detect violations of the rank-1 generated property.",

Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution automatically, through the closure of the Poission Bracket algebra of the full set of constraints and the Hamiltonian. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: (1) the classical brachistochrone problem and (2) the time-optimal control of a generic quantum system, relevant for quantum technological applications.

    "abstract": "Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.",

We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple.

This security stems from their modeling as Haar-random unitaries. However, implementing such unitaries on Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices is challenging due to exponential simulation complexity. Previous work tackled this using pseudo-random unitary designs but only under limited adversarial models with only black-box query access. In this paper, we propose a new QPUF construction based on chaotic quantum dynamics. We modeled the QPUF as a unitary time evolution under a chaotic Hamiltonian and proved that this approach offers security comparable to Haar-random unitaries. Intuitively, we show that while chaotic dynamics generate less randomness than ideal Haar unitaries, the randomness is still sufficient to make the QPUF unclonable in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that the evolution time required to achieve security scales linearly with number of qudits used in the scheme and can be kept public. We identified the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as a candidate for the QPUF Hamiltonian. Recent experiments using nuclear spins and cold atoms have shown progress toward achieving this goal. Inspired by recent experimental advances, we present a schematic architecture for realizing our proposed QPUF device based on optical Kagome Lattice with disorder. For adversaries with only query access, we also introduce an efficiently simulable pseudo-chaotic QPUF. Our results lay the preliminary groundwork for bridging the gap between theoretical security and the practical implementation of QPUFs for the first time.",

This is a well-studied problem in quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing, device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning the coefficients to entry-wise error $\\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \\epsilon$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to be $k$-local, we show that learning the coefficients to entry-wise constant error requires $n^{\\Omega (k)}$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Bakshi, Liu, Moitra, and Tang. These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where the goal is to decide whether or not there is a single coefficient which is super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian. Our lower bound also holds in natural average-case settings, suggesting that this hardness is likely unavoidable in many natural settings, without additional structure.",

    "abstract": "Building on the standard hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, we construct a generalized formulation suitable for open quantum systems interacting with nonstationary Gaussian baths, potentially extending its applicability to nonequilibrium baths. This is achieved by extending the conventional exponential decomposition of bath correlation functions (BCF) to allow explicitly time-dependent forms. We demonstrate the method's performance on two examples of nonstationary squeezed reservoirs generated via uniform squeezing and degenerate parametric amplification. Benchmarking against the associated hierarchy of master equations shows that HOPS achieves superior efficiency under hierarchy truncation. In cases where each contribution in the BCF expansion can be associated with an independent physical bath, the formalism can be simplified in a pseudomode representation which is more efficient in a strongly non-Markovian regime. Our results highlight HOPS as a versatile and powerful tool for simulating open quantum systems in nonstationary baths, with potential applications ranging from squeezed light-matter interactions to driven quantum materials and dissipative phase transitions.",

    "title": "Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories",
    "abstract": "Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\\pm0.07)\\%$ to $(99.61\\pm0.04)\\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.",

The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model. We then consider few thought experiments in order to analyze to what extent Quantum Mechanics follows relativistic invariance and find the specific critical points where non invariance possibly occurs. The relevance of this analysis on the experimental observations is also discussed.",

These decompositions enable a direct and efficient mapping of the Potts model dynamics into hardware-efficient qudit gate sequences for trapped-ion platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a Suzuki-Trotter approximation with our evolution-into-gates framework, for detecting the dynamical quantum phase transition.

Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity.

We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses.

The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point.

Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a cold-atom analogue of a solid-state Hall bar and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analogue quantum simulations and measurements performed in solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.",

As a case study, we focus on the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\\tau \\to \\pi \\nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.",

This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.",

However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \\textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.",

    "title": "Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems",
    "abstract": "Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.",

The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\\sigma_p r \\ge \\hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\\sigma_p r \\ge \\pi\\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.",

    "title": "Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order",
    "abstract": "Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.",

For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.",

In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.",

Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.",

Unlike the classical setting, where the braiding symmetry is required to be invertible, distorted monoidal categories admit non-invertible binary distortions and unit distortions while preserving coherent tensorial reasoning. We show that these structures naturally assemble into a strict 2-category whose composition and interchange laws hold on the nose, not merely up to isomorphism. Beyond the abstract 2-monad justification, our contribution is a fully constructive and type-safe calculus that enables formal reasoning about non-invertible interchange. We provide explicit construction schemes for such distortions, including idempotent twists of classical braidings and graded unit distortions arising from characters on monoidal gradings. This framework extends the expressive power of monoidal categories to model irreversible, resource-sensitive, and direction-dependent processes --such as those in directed homotopy theory, categorical quantum mechanics, and non-symmetric operadic structures--while remaining amenable to mechanization and formal verification.",

The first main contribution of this work is the derivation of an inhomogeneous Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality adapted to the unbounded weight, which provides the necessary control over the nonlinear term in terms of Sobolev norms. Building on this inequality, we then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions and establish a sharp dichotomy: solutions with initial data below the ground state energy either exist globally in time or experience finite-time blow-up. A distinctive feature of our results is that the analysis of the unbounded inhomogeneous term requires the imposition of radial symmetry on the initial data, which allows us to exploit certain Strauss type Sobolev estimates that would not hold in the general non-radial case. This work complements previous studies on biharmonic Schrödinger equations with singular inhomogeneities, highlighting both the challenges and the new phenomena that arise when the nonlinearity is weighted by a growing up unbounded function, which broke the space translation invariance of the standard homogeneous associated equation.",

Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice (L, \\le ) ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , \\le is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on (L,\\le) may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on (L,\\le), the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). This paper gives the necessary and sufficient conditions under which convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). Moreover, note that the computational complexity of operators prevent the application of T2 RFSs. This paper also provides one kind of convolutions which are t-norms on (L,\\le) and extremely easy to calculate.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the dynamic phase transitions and pattern formations attributed to binary systems modeled by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In particular, we consider a two-dimensional lattice structure and determine how different choices of the spanning vectors influence the resulting dynamical tramsitions and pattern formations. As the basic steady-state loses its linear stability, the binary system undergoes a dynamic transition which is shown to be characterized by both the geometry of the domain and the choice of physical parameters of the model. Unlike rectangular domains, we are able to observe the emergence of hexagonally-packed circles, as well as the familiar rolls and square structures. We begin with the decomposition of our function space into a stable and unstable eigenspace before calculating the center manifold that maps the former to the later. In analyzing the resulting reduced equations, we consider the different multiplicities that the critical eigenvalue can have, which is shown to be geometry-dependent. We briefly consider the long-range interaction model and determine that it produces similar results to the original model.",

These models are characterized by coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in the Collatz dynamics, and are suitably defined. Here, $\\alpha=\\beta=1$, and $\\alpha=3$, $\\beta=1$ correspond to the Nollatz and classical Collatz operators, respectively. In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szegő operator of Gérard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed. It is proved that, except for the Nollatz and Collatz operators, the sum of coefficients related to this discrete time derivative is an increasing sequence in $n$ as the iteration parameter $n$ evolves.",

The case of primes $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2. A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(\\alpha,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis. This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erdős--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions.

The receiver aims to decode only user 1 message but may also decode user 2 message when beneficial. In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced. We derive achievable upper bounds on the generalized error performance, defined as a weighted sum of incorrect-decoding, collision, and miss-detection probabilities, for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.",

The same conclusion holds when $G$ is the direct product of a dihedral group and the $2$-element group. On the other hand, the smallest non-abelian groups $G$ are found for which the separating Noether number over $K$ is strictly less than the Noether number over $K$. Along the way the exact value of the separating Noether number is determined for all groups of order at most $16$. The results show in particular that unlike the ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian finite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper direct factor of the group.",

    "abstract": "Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability. This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions. We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.",

Within this setting we develop a theory for two-sided Miyachi multipliers, relying on discrete almost diagonalization and Wiener-Jaffard type results for well-localized matrices, and obtain boundedness on weighted modulation spaces. Finally, we define a Gabor-type wavefront set adapted to the subdyadic geometry and prove its invariance and ellipticity with respect to smooth order-zero pseudodifferential operators.

These are maximally non-integrable distributions with natural symplectisations and contactisations, that generalize contact distributions to higher corank. We focus on the corank-$2$ case, where we study a natural class of submanifolds, which we call prelegendrians. Their key feature is that they admit a canonical Legendrian lift to the contactisation. Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions. This is the first example of rigidity in the study of maximally non-integrable distributions, outside of contact topology. First, we find an infinite family of $(2n+1)$-tori in the standard fat $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, with the following two properties: (1) They all represent the same formal prelegendrian class, (2) but they are not prelegendrian isotopic because they are distinguished by pseudoholomorphic curve invariants of their Legendrian lift. Secondly, we define the notion of prelegendrian stabilization in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$. This allows us to take an arbitrary prelegendrian and produce another one, in the same formal class, whose Legendrian lift is loose. In order to prove these results we also develop the fundamentals of the theory of prelegendrians. This includes: (1) introducing the notion of front projection in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, (2) proving that pseudoholomorphic curve invariants are robust under perturbations of the fat structure, allowing us to transport our results to non-standard fat structures, (3) introducing a zooming argument showing that any fat structure in dimension $6$ admits prelegendrians.",

In this work, we present a new construction where the regularization is itself built as the sum of two terms: i) the M norm of the regularizing operator L1 b L2, with L1 and L2 being two one-dimensional differential operators; ii) a bounded-variation norm that regularizes on the infinite-dimensional nullspace of L1 b L2. In this construction, we show that the extreme points of the solution set are the tensor product of one-dimensional splines, with a number of atoms upper-bounded in term of the number of data points. Further, when the data of the inverse problem is localized, we reveal that the term ii) must take the form of a sum of bounded-variation norms, precomposed with partial derivative of different orders.",

This research addresses this critical gap by developing a large-scale, calibrated agent-based model for supplier selection, complemented by a probabilistic heuristic for international shipments. Our approach integrates trade relationships between industry sectors, transportation costs, and supplier rating model adapted from existing literature. The model's core objective is to minimize the discrepancy between modeled and observed commodity flows while ensuring a close match to regional shipping distance distributions. Implemented and tested across four major U.S. metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles, the model demonstrates high fidelity in replicating observed freight patterns. Key findings reveal consistent alignment with national shipping distance trends and highlight significant spatial variations in commodity trade assignments and demand across the study regions. This behaviorally informed and transport-sensitive framework is designed to approximate real-world decision-making, providing a robust tool for policymakers and planners to evaluate targeted interventions, assess infrastructure investments, and enhance supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions.",

The transition from single-active-port to multi-active-port on a shared RF chain for slow FAMA can greatly enhance its multiplexing capability but is not well understood. Motivated by this, this paper proposes and studies three port selection methods: the optimal exhaustive-search port selection (EPS) as a performance upper bound, and two suboptimal, low-complexity algorithms, namely incremental port selection (IPS) and decremental port selection (DPS). Then the performance of multi-active-port slow FAMA is analyzed, and the complexity of the proposed methods is compared. Simulation results indicate that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art multi-port FAMA techniques. In particular, IPS achieves near-optimal performance while maintaining manageable computational complexity. This research provides a more general framework for port selection in FAMA systems.",

To quantify the performance scaling of FAS with a large number of antenna ports, this paper leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). The analysis reveals that the OP decays approximately exponentially with the number of antenna ports. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic EC, uncovering its double-logarithmic scaling law. Furthermore, we re-substantiate these scaling laws by exploiting the fact that the mode of the Gumbel distribution scales logarithmically. Besides, we theoretically prove that spatial correlation among antenna ports degrades both OP and EC. All analytical findings are conclusively validated by numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.",

    "abstract": "We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.",

The mathematical and numerical analysis of this model is performed in the frequency domain. The variational formulation is analyzed within the framework of Fredholm's alternative and T-coercivity. Under appropriate assumptions on the coefficients, the well-posedness of the problem is proved. For its discretization, we propose a stabilized coupling of conforming and mixed finite element spaces, which are free of volumetric locking, and both, pressure as well as temperature oscillations. By incorporating projections in certain sesquilinear forms, the well-posedness of the finite element solution can be obtained through a similar reasoning as in the continuous case. Optimal error estimates are derived for all variables. Numerical studies validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.",

The formalism recovers classical gradient, proximal, and momentum schemes as first-order flat cases and extends naturally to stochastic, preconditioned, and adaptive algorithms through perturbations controlled by curvature order.

We consider problems where the objective function and constraint polynomials are invariant under the action of a finite group.

We first exploit symmetry by writing the semidefinite matrices in a symmetry-adapted basis according to an isotypic decomposition. The matrices in such a basis are block diagonal. Secondly, we exploit term sparsity on each block to further reduce the optimization matrix variables. This is a non-trivial extension of the term sparsity-based hierarchy related to sign symmetry that was introduced by two of the authors.

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming (DP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet its inherently sequential structure has long limited its scalability in scenario-based stochastic programming (SP). This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated framework that reformulates a broad class of forward DP recursions as batched min-plus matrix-vector products over layered DAGs, collapsing actions into masked state-to-state transitions that map seamlessly to GPU kernels. Using this reformulation, our approach takes advantage of massive parallelism across both scenarios and transitions, enabling the simultaneous evaluation of \\emph{over one million uncertainty realizations} in a single GPU pass -- a scale far beyond the reach of existing methods. We instantiate the framework in two canonical applications: the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand and a dynamic stochastic inventory routing problem. In both cases, DP subroutines traditionally considered sequential are redesigned to harness two- or three-dimensional GPU parallelism. Experiments demonstrate near-linear scaling in the number of scenarios and yield one to three orders of magnitude speedups over multithreaded CPU baselines, resulting in tighter SAA estimates and significantly stronger first-stage decisions under fixed time budgets. Beyond these applications, our work establishes a general-purpose recipe for transforming classical DP routines into high-throughput GPU primitives, substantially expanding the computational frontier of stochastic discrete optimization to the million-scenario scale.",

Its relevance to medical applications also drives advances in DNA-related biotechnology. To protect our data against errors, a straightforward approach uses one error-correcting code per DNA strand, with a Reed--Solomon code protecting the collection of strands. A downside is that current technology can only synthesize strands 200--300 nucleotides long. At this block length, the inner code rate suffers a significant finite-length penalty, making its effective capacity hard to characterize. Last year, we proposed $\\textit{Geno-Weaving}$ in a JSAIT publication. The idea is to protect the same position across multiple strands using one code; this provably achieves capacity against substitution errors. In this paper, we extend the idea to combat deletion errors and show two more advantages of Geno-Weaving: (1) Because the number of strands is 3--4 orders of magnitude larger than the strand length, the finite-length penalty vanishes. (2) At realistic deletion rates $0.1\\%$--$10\\%$, Geno-Weaving designed for BSCs works well empirically, bypassing the need to tailor the design for deletion channels.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks have the potential to support high throughput and low-latency requirements of 5G-and-beyond communication standards. But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott this http URL transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal.",

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds defined by randomly sampled point clouds is a challenging problem in scientific computing and has broad applications in various fields. In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds.",

In this paper, considering practical scenarios with non-real-time rotatable antenna adjustment, we investigate the average secrecy rate maximization problem of a rotatable antenna-assisted secure communication system. We theoretically prove that the objective function of the average secrecy rate maximization problem is quasi-concave with respect to an adjustment factor of the rotatable antenna. Under this condition, the optimal solution can be found by the bisection search. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form optimal deflection angle for the secrecy capacity maximization problem, considering the existence of only line-of-sight components of wireless channels. This solution serves as a near optimal solution to the average secrecy rate maximization problem. Based on the closed-form near optimal solution, we obtain the system secrecy outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown through simulation results that the near optimal solution achieves almost the same average secrecy capacity as the optimal solution. It is also found that at high SNR, the theoretical secrecy outage probabilities match the simulation ones.",

    "title": "A Ternary Gamma Semiring Framework for Solving Multi-Objective Network Optimization Problems",
    "abstract": "Classical shortest-path methods rely on binary tropical semirings $(\\min,+)$, whose dyadic structure limits them to pairwise cost interactions. However, many real-world systems, including logistics, supply chains, communication networks, and reliability-aware infrastructures, exhibit inherently ternary dependencies among cost, time, and risk that cannot be decomposed into pairwise components. This paper introduces the \\emph{Ternary Tropical Gamma Semiring} (TTGS), a $\\Gamma$-indexed algebraic structure that generalizes tropical semirings by replacing binary additive composition with a non-separable ternary operator. We establish the axioms of TTGS, prove associativity, distributivity, and monotonicity, and show that TTGS forms a well-structured foundation for multi-parameter optimization. Building on this framework, we develop TTGS-Pathfinder, a ternary analogue of the Bellman--Ford algorithm. We derive its dynamic-programming recurrence, prove correctness through an invariant-based argument, analyze convergence under the TTGS order, and obtain an $O(n^2 m)$ complexity bound. Applications demonstrate that TTGS naturally models systems whose behaviour depends on triadic cost interactions, offering a principled alternative to binary tropical, vector, or scalarized multi-objective methods.",

Dykstra's algorithm is an iterative scheme for computing the Euclidean projection of an initial point onto the intersection of convex sets by successively projecting onto each set. Its low per-iteration computational cost makes it well-suited for solving large-scale or real-time problems where traditional optimisation routines become computationally burdensome. Despite its strong convergence guarantees, Dykstra's algorithm is known to suffer from stalling -- arbitrarily long intervals during which the primal iterates remain constant -- rendering its runtime unpredictable and severely limiting its applicability in time-critical settings. Focusing on polyhedral constraint sets, we derive a closed-form solution for the length of the stalling period once stalling is detected. This result enables a modified, stall-averse version of Dykstra's algorithm that fast-forwards the stalling period via a single, inexpensive update while preserving convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence behaviour, establishing the proposed method as a practical enhancement for a broad class of projection-based algorithms.",

Loehr and Mendes provide a full proof using bijective matrix algebra that relies on the Eğecioğlu--Remmel map. In this article, we solve the problem in full generality independent of the Eğecioğlu--Remmel bijection. To do this, we start by proving NSym versions of both Kostka matrix identities using sign-reversing involutions involving the tunnel hook coverings recently introduced by the first and third authors. Then we modify our sign-reversing involutions to reduce to Sym. Finally, we show that our bijection is different than the Loehr and Mendes result by constructing an injective map between special rim tableaux and the symmetric group $S_n.$",

Then, the Gao's constant $\\mathsf E (G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $\\ell$ such that every sequence of length at least $\\ell$ has a product-one subsequence of length $|G|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$. Let $G = C_n \\rtimes_s C_2$ with $s^2\\equiv 1\\pmod n$ be a metacyclic group. The direct and inverse problems of $\\mathsf E (G)$ were settled recently, except for the case that $G=C_{3n_2}\\rtimes_s C_2$ with $n_2\\neq 1$, $\\gcd(n_2,6)=1$, $s\\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, and $s\\equiv 1\\pmod {n_2}$. In this paper, we complete the remaining case and hence for all metacyclic groups of the form $G=C_n \\rtimes C_2$, the Gao's constant and the associated inverse problem are now fully settled (see Theorem 1.2).",

    "abstract": "Currently known secondary construction techniques for linear codes mainly include puncturing, shortening, and extending. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the secondary construction of linear codes based on their weight functions. Specifically, we develop a general framework that constructs new linear codes from the set of codewords in a given code having a fixed Hamming weight. We analyze the dimension, number of weights, and weight distribution of the constructed codes, and establish connections with the extendability of the original codes as well as the partial weight distribution of the derived codes. As a new tool, this framework enables us to establish an upper bound on the minimum weight of two-weight codes and to characterize all two-weight codes attaining this bound. Moreover, several divisibility properties concerning the parameters of two-weight codes are derived. The proposed method not only generates new families of linear codes but also provides a powerful approach for exploring the intrinsic combinatorial and geometric structures of existing codes.",

    "title": "The Mixed Birth-death/death-Birth Moran Process",
    "abstract": "We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\\lambda$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\\lambda=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\\lambda=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are \"almost regular,\" in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \\sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\\Omega_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\\lambda$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \\alpha^4)$ for all $\\lambda$, where $\\alpha = d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $\\lambda$.",

Such a witness exists only to maintain syntactic consistency and carries no standard observational semantics. On the proof-theoretic side, we attribute the gap between pointwise verifiability and global provability to a failure of Uniform Reflection. We formalize this as a syntactic self-description failure SDF(T, phi) for proof systems T. Under this failure we obtain an observational barrier: Con(T) implies not Prov_T(phi). In this sense, undecidability in ZFC for Pi0_1 sentences does not describe any observable mathematical reality; it marks a \"semantic void\", a structural shadow arising not from a standard counterexample but from the expressive limitations of the formal system.

    "abstract": "In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.",

Working on the idèle class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--Pólya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow.",

The notion of persistence diagrams, which is a standard tool in topological data analysis, provides a way to record these birth and death times. In this paper, we understand the asymptotic behavior of the persistence diagrams of the above defined randomly evolving complexes as $n$ goes to infinity. As the single time marginals of the above process are variants of the Linial-Meshulam complex, our results can be viewed as extensions of the results of Linial and Peled on the Betti numbers of the Linial-Meshulam complex.

By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks.

    "abstract": "Many large-scale constrained optimization problems can be formulated as bilevel distributed optimization tasks over undirected networks, where agents collaborate to minimize a global cost function while adhering to constraints, relying only on local communication and computation. In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.",

    "abstract": "Function-correcting codes (FCCs) are designed to provide error protection for the value of a function computed on the data. Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection.",

The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model. In our limited understanding, we believe that this kind of phenomenon cannot be explained by the Parisi approach.",

    "abstract": "Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) are pivotal for enabling ubiquitous connectivity in 6G systems, yet they face significant challenges due to severe satellite-to-ground link impairments. Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can function as relay nodes to compensate for air-to-ground channel degradation, the satellite-to-UAV link remains a critical bottleneck. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution to enhance spectral efficiency by transmitting essential semantic information. This paper proposes a novel multi-cluster UAV-aided SAGIN SemCom architecture that supports both semantic users (SemUsers) and conventional users (ConUsers). While SemCom is employed in the satellite-to-UAV link to improve transmission efficiency, the UAVs implement an intelligent adaptive relay strategy, capable of either directly forwarding semantic data to SemUsers or converting it into bit-level data for ConUsers. Compared to existing similar schemes, this design guarantees the high-efficiency advantages of SemCom while enabling network access for larger coverage area. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system's sum-rate through coordinated allocation of power, bandwidth, and UAV positions. To address this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of both sum-rate and spectral efficiency across various channel conditions and user distributions, underscoring the importance of joint resource allocation and intelligent UAV deployment.",

The statistical properties of the product are encoded in its generalised Lyapunov exponent whose computation reduces to finding the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator. In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(\\tau^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible. For $d=2$, we compute the growth rate of the product in terms of complete elliptic integrals. By letting the elliptic modulus vary, we obtain a spectral problem, corresponding to a modulus-dependent random renewing flow, which may be viewed as a perturbation of the spectral problem for the angular Laplacian. In this way, we deduce expansions for the generalised Lyapunov exponent in ascending powers of the modulus.

The relativistic formulation provides a physically consistent setting for multi-species systems where inertia and internal energy depend on temperature, as occurs in astrophysical plasmas or relativistic fluids. Using the entropy principle, we derive uniform lower bounds for temperature and establish asymptotic flocking under various communication kernels. For nearly constant interactions, flocking emerges from arbitrary initial data. The results clarify how thermodynamic effects and relativistic corrections modify the emergence of coherent motion in particle systems, bridging kinetic theory, relativistic fluid mixtures, and collective dynamics.",

We prove that a congruence uniform lattice is shellable if and only if it is extremal. We answer a question of Barnard by constructing a counterexample showing that an induced subcomplex of a canonical join complex need not itself be such a complex. Finally, we show that the order dimension of a semidistributive extremal lattice equals the chromatic number of the complement of its Galois graph, generalizing a theorem of Dilworth for distributive lattices. As an application, we determine the dimensions of generalizations of the Hochschild lattice, of the parabolic Tamari lattice, and of the lattice of torsion classes of a gentle tree.

To model this, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which two time series $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(x^\\#_t)_{t\\in[T]}$ are jointly generated, such that $x^\\#_t=x_{\\pi^*(t)}+\\sigma \\tilde{x}_{\\pi^*(t)}$, where $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(\\tilde{x}_t)_{t\\in[T]}$ are independent and identically distributed vector autoregressive (VAR) time series of order $1$ with Gaussian increments, for a hidden $\\pi^*$. The objective is to recover $\\pi^*$, from the observation of $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(x^\\#_t)_{t\\in[T]}$. This generalizes the classical problem of matching independent point clouds to the time series setting. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to a quadratic optimization over permutations, and theoretically analyze an estimator based on linear assignment. For the latter approach, we establish recovery guarantees, identifying thresholds for $\\sigma$ that allow for perfect or partial recovery. Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope). This allows for efficient estimation of $\\pi^*$ and the VAR parameters via alternating minimization. Empirically, we find that linear assignment often matches or outperforms MLE relaxation based approaches.",

At this respect, the most convenient mutual sphere-plane position has been object of a long debate, an account of which can be found in \\cite{Albouy2013}. This fascinating topic, resumed %subject, firstly by A. Albouy in the aforementioned paper, has been expanded from the theoretical side in \\cite{Albouy2015}. Further investigations recently appeared in \\cite{AlbouyZhao2019, Zhao1, TakeuchiZhao1, TakeuchiZhao2}. As remarked in \\cite{Albouy2013, Albouy2015}, extensions of the procedure to more dynamical systems would open to the possibility of finding first integrals to a given dynamical system simply looking at the energy of the mirror problem. In this note, we focus on the case of the problem of two fixed centers, already mentioned in \\cite{Albouy2013}. We provide a{n explicit} geometrical construction allowing to interpret the first integral of the problem as the energy of its projection on an ellipsoid. Compared to previous papers on the same subject, ours -- besides being based on a somehow different construction -- includes complete explicit computations. {A byproduct of our construction is the existence of two integrable mirror problems (equivalently, three quadratic integrals, including the energy) for the Kepler problem, which is an aspect of its super-integrability.",

The core idea of this data-driven algorithm is based on the fact that an honest state (one not compromised by adversaries) generated by the CPS should concentrate near its weighted empirical mean of the immediate past samples. As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively. Moreover, we establish that for adversaries possessing a certain minimum energy, the false negative error incurred by AD-CPS is low. Extensive experiments were conducted on partially observed stochastic LTI systems to demonstrate these properties and to quantitatively compare AD-CPS with an optimal CUSUM-based test.",

Our nondegeneracy condition is proved to be satisfied by Kirchhoff ellipses and along the local bifurcation curves emanating from the Rankine vortex. The construction, that is based on a local stream function formulation in a tubular neighborhood of the patch boundary, is a synthesis of delicate analysis on thin domains, nonlinear a priori estimates, and a custom version of Newton's method. Our techniques are robust enough to additionally allow us to construct exotic families of singular rotating vortex patch-like solutions nearby a given nondegenerate state.

    "abstract": "We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences. As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field. Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Leblé and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.",

We also prove local universality at regular soft edges for droplets with several components, and lastly for soft/hard edges where a hard edge perfectly aligns with the droplet boundary.

While prior research has mainly focused on linear VAR models, these approaches can be restrictive in practice. To address this, we introduce a high-dimensional non-parametric sparse additive model, providing a more flexible framework. Our method employs basis expansions to construct high-dimensional nonlinear VAR models. We derive convergence rates and model selection consistency for least squared estimators, considering dependence measures of the processes, error moment conditions, sparsity, and basis expansions. Our theory significantly extends prior linear VAR models by incorporating both non-Gaussianity and non-linearity. As a key contribution, we derive sharp Bernstein-type inequalities for tail probabilities in both non-sub-Gaussian linear and nonlinear VAR processes, which match the classical Bernstein inequality for independent random variables. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of the nonlinear VAR model for a gene expression time series dataset.",

Statistical analysis demonstrates that: (i) spatial position optimization in FRIS provides noticeable gains over conventional RIS in the absence of phase-shift design; (ii) such benefits vanish when FRIS and conventional RIS employ optimal beamforming (BF) and phase shift (PS) design, making position optimization irrelevant; (iii) FRIS consistently outperforms compact RIS with optimized BF and PS design, owing to spatial correlation and smaller aperture.",

To address these challenges, this work proposes an iterative channel estimation scheme that exploits low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, channel coherence time, and iterative processing to improve estimation accuracy while minimizing pilot length. Encoded pilots are used to strengthen the iterative processing, leveraging both pilot and parity bits, while previous estimates are incorporated to further reduce overhead. Simulations consider a sub-6 GHz scenario with non-sparse channels and multiple RIS under both LOS and NLOS conditions. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving significant gains with substantially lower pilot overhead.",

To characterize the end-to-end FRIS channel, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach is introduced, while a Q-learning algorithm is employed to adaptively select the spatial positions of FRIS elements. Numerical evaluations show that optimizing element placement in FRIS significantly improves SOP compared to conventional RIS without phase adaptation. However, these improvements become less evident once the conventional RIS implements optimized beamforming (BF) and phase-shift (PS) controlling. In addition, FRIS maintains a clear advantage over compact RIS designs with optimized BF and PS, mainly due to its lower spatial correlation. Results further indicate that reducing the inter-element distance negatively impacts SOP, highlighting the importance of spatial diversity.",

The hull plays a crucial role in determining the complexity of algorithms used to check the permutation equivalence of two linear codes and compute a linear code's automorphism group. Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest. A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes\", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that any LCD code over an extended binary field \\( \\FF_q \\) (where \\( q > 3 \\)) with a minimum distance of at least $2$ is equivalent to the one-dimensional hull of a linear code under a specific weak condition. Furthermore, we provide a construction for creating hulls with \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensionality from an \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hull of a linear code, again under a weak condition. This corresponds to a particularly challenging direction, as creating \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hulls from \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensional hulls.

    "abstract": "We give a Hilton-Milner Theorem for the $r$-independent sets in the graph that is the union of copies of $K_k$. That is, we determine the maximum intersecting families of $r$-independent sets in this graph, subject to the condition that the sets in a family do not all share a common element. As a by-product, we also find a tight upper bound for the sum of sizes of a pair of cross intersecting families made up of the same objects. We apply our theorem to find the largest intersecting family of $r$-independent sets in a family of graphs called ``depth-two claws\". This confirms the Holroyd--Talbot conjecture for depth-two claws, extending previous results on these graphs (which covered cases where $r$ was relatively small compared to the number of vertices) to all possible values of $r$.",

    "title": "Acceleration Techniques for Learning Optimal Classification Trees with Integer Programming",
    "abstract": "Decision trees are a popular machine learning model which are traditionally trained by heuristic methods. Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets.",

This identity leads to two key limits for surface integrals involving scattered solutions, from which we deduce the first uniqueness result of direct problem for all frequencies. Through a detailed analysis, applying the steepest descent method, subsequently we derive the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding two-layered Green's tensor along with its explicit expression when the transmission coefficient equals 1. Finally, by leveraging properties of the Green's tensor, we establish the existence of solutions via the variational method and the boundary integral equation, thereby achieving the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by rough interfaces.",

There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded this http URL a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arXiv:2308.01853v2 ), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp. Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.",

However, the stabilization term does not generally conform to the physics of the considered problem and a criterion for its choice is not typically supported by theoretical arguments. Hence, stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed. Moreover, the accuracy of VEM deteriorates in case of problems with variable coefficients, that are not usually accounted when constructing polynomial projections. The mentioned aspects might limit the use of the method when tackling real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy, while suffering from worse conditioning. Moreover, a new approach for dealing with variable coefficients is introduced: the discrete space is modified so that general coefficients can be accounted when computing the polynomial projectors. Numerical results show that this new approach is more robust than the standard ones.",

We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "One of the desirable objectives in feedback control design is to formulate and solve the design problem as an optimisation problem that is convex, so that an optimal solution can be found efficiently. Unfortunately many control design problems are non-convex: approximations, relaxations, or iterative schemes are usually employed to solve them. Several such approaches have been developed in the literature, for example Sum-of-Squares (SOSs) methods have been used for systems described by polynomial dynamics. Alternatively, and relevant to this paper, one can choose a (non-unique) linear-like representation of the system and solve the resulting state-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) or use SOSs optimisation techniques to derive a control law. This SOS method has been shown to effectively design polynomial and rational controllers for nonlinear polynomial systems, offering a broader class of controllers and the potential for improved performance and robustness guarantees. In this paper, we start off by considering rational functions as controllers for nonlinear systems and propose a procedure for designing such controllers by iteratively solving convex SOS optimisation problems. Our approach decouples the controller structure from the system dynamics and incorporates it as a constraint within the optimisation problem, which results in an optimisation that co-designs aspects of the controller and the Lyapunov function at the same iterative step. We theoretically establish the properties of this procedure by showing that several existing rational controller design methods can be recovered as special cases of this procedure. The proposed method is evaluated on various nonlinear benchmark system examples, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over both polynomial controllers and rational controllers obtained by existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation.",

The second is a suitably localized version of the relation of almost-compact embeddings, which has been successfully used to study compactness in function spaces over measure spaces of finite measure, but becomes of no use in the case of infinite measure. Our framework is that of quasi-Banach function spaces, which need not be normable or rearrangement invariant. This level of generality leads us to introduce the notion of extremal fundamental functions associated with a (quasi-)Banach function space. We provide several concrete examples and establish an abstract compactness principle involving the new relations.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel quadrature strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) boundary element discretizations, specifically tailored to collocation methods. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction and the natural handling of unbounded domains, boundary integral formulations are particularly appealing in the IgA framework. However, they require the evaluation of boundary integrals whose kernels exhibit singular or nearly singular behavior. Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used in modern wireless communication systems due to its robustness against time-dispersive channels. In this work, we consider a non-cooperative scenario where the receiver does not have prior knowledge of the OFDM parameters such as the number of subcarriers and the aim is to estimate them using the received data. Such a setup has applications in cognitive radio networks. For this blind OFDM parameter estimation problem, we provide a novel method based on eigen-spectral analysis of the covariance matrix corresponding to the received data. In particular, we show that the covariance matrix exhibits a distinctive rank property under correct segmentation of the received symbols, reflecting a characteristic behavior in its eigenvalue spectrum that facilitates accurate estimation of the number of subcarriers. The proposed method is more general than existing approaches in the literature, as it can detect an arbitrary number of subcarriers and its performance remains independent of the modulation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed method accurately detects the number of subcarriers with high probability even at low SNR.",

This extends the semigroup-fication procedure introduced by Bracci and Roth to non-univalent functions. We use our technique in order to obtain sharp estimates for the rate with which the orbits of $f$ converge to the attracting fixed point; a fundamental, yet underdeveloped, concept in discrete iteration.

We describe the long-time behavior of solutions for all non-degenerate perturbations in resonant regime, proving that either there exist solutions whose Sobolev norms explode exponentially fast, provoking energy transfer phenomena, or all solutions remain stable for arbitrarily long time scales. The proof combines pseudodifferential tools with dynamical systems results: we perform a resonant normal form procedure to reduce our analysis to the classical dynamics for the resonant equation. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics. This is obtained by means of a positive commutator estimate on the operator associated with the escape function, exploiting microlocal analysis.",

Storing the solution's finite element coefficients explicitly requires $\\mathcal O(n \\log n)$ bits of storage, where $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper presents a full multigrid method to compute the solution in a compressed format that reduces the storage complexity of the solution and intermediate vectors to $\\mathcal O(n)$ bits. This reduction allows a matrix-free implementation to solve elliptic PDEs with an overall linear space complexity. For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids.",

    "abstract": "We study a class of deterministic mean field games and related optimal control problems, with a finite time horizon and in which the state space is a network. An agent controls her velocity, and, when she occupies a vertex, she can either remain still or enter any adjacent edge. The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge, but may jump at the vertices. Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties. For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function. These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network. Given $m$, the value function $u$ is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi problem on the network. We then investigate the regularity properties of $u$ and a weak form of a Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by $m$.",

We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval.",

Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules.

To further enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a quotient-manifold-based optimization framework that leverages the underlying Riemannian geometry in a matrix factorization space.

    "title": "Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints",
    "abstract": "The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.",

At each iteration, we combine convex surrogate with first-order information to construct linearly constrained subproblems to handle the concavity of model. The corresponding subproblems are then solved by alternating direction method of multipliers to satisfy the specific stop criteria. In particular, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm guarantees the feasibility of each subsequent iteration point, and the cluster point of the resulting feasible sequence is shown to be a stationary point. Additionally, we extend the group sparse optimization model, pioneer the application of the double iterative reweighted algorithm to solve constrained group sparse models (which exhibits superior efficiency), and incorporate a generalized Bregman distance to characterize the algorithm's termination conditions. Preliminary numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.",

Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals.

    "abstract": "Scientific calculations involving multiplication, division, exponents, inverse exponents of real numbers, geometric mean, reciprocal, Euler number, logarithm, and antilogarithm are generally carried out using battery operated electronic calculators. In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques.",

Individuals are either ignorants, spreaders, or stiflers; spreaders stop by contact with other spreaders or stiflers or after an independent random waiting time sampled from a given distribution, modeling a spontaneous loss of interest. The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states. The mean-field limit is described by a system of nonlinear integral equations, while fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian and governed by a system of stochastic integral equations with explicit covariance. Our results show how the topology and the law of spontaneous stifling jointly shape the speed and variability of rumor outbreaks. As a special case, our model reduces to the classical Maki-Thompson model when spontaneous stifling is absent.",

In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \\leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity.

We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled.

This paper introduces a general Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to model and solve, in an exact way, problems whose solutions are weak orders (a.k.a.\\ bucket orders). Within this framework, we consider additional relevant constraints to produce the consensus bucket order, considering configurations with a fixed number of buckets, predefined bucket sizes, top-$k$ type problems, and fairness constraints. All these formulations are developed in a general setting, allowing their application to different rank aggregation contexts. One of these problems is the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), for which we propose for the first time an exact formulation and test the variants proposed. The computational study includes, on the one hand, a comparison between the exact results obtained by our models and the heuristic methods proposed by Aledo et al.\\ (2018), and on the other hand, an additional evaluation of their performance on a representative set of instances from the PrefLib library. The results confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a solid foundation for future research on rank aggregation problems with weak orders as consensus rankings.",

For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples.",

A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new class of error-correcting codes constructed from the ideal lattices of finite commutative ternary Gamma-semirings (TGS). Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks. A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method. These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems.",

    "abstract": "We study the Wigner kernel and the Gabor matrix associated with the propagators of a broad class of linear evolution equations, including the complex heat, wave, and Hermite equations. Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation is analyzed via Hörmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane, reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow. The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics.",

In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the Lévy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a Lévy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework.",

Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.",

Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination.",

    "abstract": "Discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), such as the DCT-2 and the DST-7, are widely used in video codecs for their balance between coding performance and computational efficiency. In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available.",

By relaxing the assumption of an underlying metric space, our theorems can be applied to a broader range of network data, including financial and social networks. To derive the limit theorems, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (also known as physical dependence) from time series to random variables with network dependence.

We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.",

    "abstract": "Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).",

A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.",

While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy.",

Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of \"influencers\" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.",

We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets.",

A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations.",

Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\\Pr(R_K \\ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $\\alpha$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide one of the first comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for a standard optimistic algorithm in episodic reinforcement learning.",

Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.",

    "title": "A Fair OR-ML Framework for Resource Substitution in Large-Scale Networks",
    "abstract": "Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$\\kappa$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.",

While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \\( d_H(\\mathcal{E}_N,\\mathcal{E}_\\infty) \\le r_W\\,\\gamma^{N+1}/(1-\\gamma), \\) where $\\gamma<1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.",

To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism. We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.",

We introduce an iterative bicolored percolation process in two dimensions and show that it can both preserve and transform criticality. Starting from critical configurations, such as the O$(n)$ loop and fuzzy Potts models, successive coarse-graining generates a hierarchy of distinct yet critical generations. Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations.",

The system integrates data extraction from PDFs, large language models for ingredient standardization, and binary integer programming to generate a 15-week recipe schedule that minimizes projected wholesale costs while meeting nutritional constraints. All 157 recipes were mapped to a nutritional database and assigned estimated and predicted costs using historical invoice data and category-specific inflation adjustments. The model effectively handles real-world price volatility and is structured for easy updates as new recipes or cost data become available. Optimization results show that constraint-based selection yields nutritionally balanced and cost-efficient plans under uncertainty. To facilitate real-time decision-making, we deployed a searchable web platform that integrates analytical models into daily operations by enabling staff to explore recipes by ingredient, category, or through an optimized meal plan.",

    "abstract": "Lévy noise influences diverse non-equilibrium systems across scales, including quantum devices, active biological matter, and financial markets. While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for Lévy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that Lévy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak Lévy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties.",

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .",

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.",

While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.",

    "abstract": "Dependent data underlies many statistical studies in the social and health sciences, which often involve sensitive or private information. Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \\textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \\iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\\textit{item-level}) and \\textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $\\mu \\in \\R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \\iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \\textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.",

    "abstract": "Two directions in algorithms and complexity involve: (1) classifying which optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, and (2) understanding which computational problems are hard to solve \\emph{on average} in addition to the worst case. For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms. Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \\emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \\emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \\emph{Gibbs measures} and the \\emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \\emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input. A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \\emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lovász extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails.",

    "abstract": "Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.",

    "abstract": "Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality. Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.",

Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical \"domain shift\" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline.

Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets.

Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines.

    "abstract": "Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.",

    "title": "Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators",
    "abstract": "Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations. Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products. We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.",

In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries.

    "abstract": "Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})|d/\\epsilon^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $\\epsilon$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|\\Theta(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/\\epsilon^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory studies populations that change in response to an underlying game. Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincaré recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.",

    "abstract": "This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature. In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.",

    "abstract": "Models with dimension more than the available sample size are now commonly used in various applications. A sensible inference is possible using a lower-dimensional structure. In regression problems with a large number of predictors, the model is often assumed to be sparse, with only a few predictors active. Interdependence between a large number of variables is succinctly described by a graphical model, where variables are represented by nodes on a graph and an edge between two nodes is used to indicate their conditional dependence given other variables. Many procedures for making inferences in the high-dimensional setting, typically using penalty functions to induce sparsity in the solution obtained by minimizing a loss function, were developed. Bayesian methods have been proposed for such problems more recently, where the prior takes care of the sparsity structure. These methods have the natural ability to also automatically quantify the uncertainty of the inference through the posterior distribution. Theoretical studies of Bayesian procedures in high-dimension have been carried out recently. Questions that arise are, whether the posterior distribution contracts near the true value of the parameter at the minimax optimal rate, whether the correct lower-dimensional structure is discovered with high posterior probability, and whether a credible region has adequate frequentist coverage. In this paper, we review these properties of Bayesian and related methods for several high-dimensional models such as many normal means problem, linear regression, generalized linear models, Gaussian and non-Gaussian graphical models. Effective computational approaches are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\\leqslant x$, denoted by $\\pi_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals: (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\\pi_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple; (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\\pi_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials. For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.",

    "abstract": "Contraction properties of transport maps between probability measures play an important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new transport map, based on the Föllmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous questions for optimal transport maps are open. The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the Kannan--Lovász--Simonovits conjecture. We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal transport maps (which are related to Brownian transport maps) between the Wiener measure and other target measures on Wiener space exhibit very different behaviors.",

It was finally resolved by Laczkovich in 1990 in the affirmative. Recently, several new proofs have emerged which achieve circle squaring with better structured pieces: namely, pieces which are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire (Grabowski-Máthé-Pikhurko) or even are Borel (Marks-Unger). In this paper, we show that circle squaring is possible with Borel pieces of positive Lebesgue measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension less than 2 (in particular, each piece is Jordan measurable). We also improve the Borel complexity of the pieces: namely, we show that each piece can be taken to be a Boolean combination of $F_\\sigma$ sets. This is a consequence of our more general result that applies to any two bounded subsets of $R^k$, $k\\ge 1$, of equal positive measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension smaller than $k$.",

In this work, we present a double-function stepsize-optimization PEP methodology that poses the optimization over fixed-step first-order methods for composite optimization as a finite-dimensional nonconvex QCQP, which can be practically solved through spatial branch-and-bound algorithms, and use it to design the exact optimal method OptISTA for the composite optimization setup. We then establish the exact optimality of OptISTA under the large-scale assumption with a lower-bound construction that extends the semi-interpolated zero-chain construction (Drori, Taylor 2022) to the double-function setup of composite optimization. By establishing exact optimality, our work concludes the search for the fastest first-order methods, with respect to the performance measure of worst-case function value suboptimality, for the proximal, projected-gradient, and proximal-gradient setups involving a smooth convex function and a closed proper convex function.",

This method is widely used in practice when the null and alternative are only specified via simulators (as in many scientific experiments). We study goodness-of-fit, two-sample ($\\mathsf{TS}$) and likelihood-free hypothesis testing ($\\mathsf{LFHT}$), and show that $\\mathsf{CAT}$ achieves (near-)minimax optimal sample complexity in both the dependence on the total-variation ($\\mathsf{TV}$) separation $\\epsilon$ and the probability of error $\\delta$ in a variety of non-parametric settings, including discrete distributions, $d$-dimensional distributions with a smooth density, and the Gaussian sequence model. In particular, we close the high probability sample complexity of $\\mathsf{LFHT}$ for each class. As another highlight, we recover the minimax optimal complexity of $\\mathsf{TS}$ over discrete distributions, which was recently established by Diakonikolas et al. (2021). The corresponding $\\mathsf{CAT}$ simply compares empirical frequencies in the first half of the data, and rejects the null when the classification accuracy on the second half is better than random.",

Inspired by nonabelian extension theory of Lie algebras, we define geometric deformations of curved $L_\\infty$ algebras constructed from a vector bundle $V\\to M$, and demonstrate that such deformations uniquely correspond to Lie algebroid structures on $V$. Explicit computations reveal that the first Atiyah-Chern class, expressible via deformed $L_\\infty$ brackets, transgresses to the de Rham coboundary of the modular class. In the case of action Lie algebroids, the leading-order Atiyah-Chern classes correspond to the equivariant Chern characters.

This homology theory has been extensively studied and it has become an ubiquitous topic in contemporary knot theory research. In the same spirit, the Kauffman skein relation, which allows to define the Kauffman bracket polynomial up to normalization of the unknot, can be categorified by means of a long exact sequence. In an expository style, in this article we present how to build Khovanov homology from the Kauffman bracket polynomial and construct its long exact sequence. Furthermore, we present a deviceful and practical way in which this long exact sequence can be used for the computation of the Khovanov homology of torus links of the type $T(2,n)$. This article serves as a partial translation of a Spanish paper to be published on occasion of the Encuentro Internacional de Matemáticas (International Meeting of Mathematics) celebrated at the Universidad del Atlántico in Barranquilla, Colombia in November 2023. This paper offers a first look into the world of Khovanov homology by constructing it from the Kauffman bracket polynomial, as it was first done by Oleg Viro. Moreover, it gives the reader references for further studies from leading experts such as D. Bar-Natan, M. Khovanov, S. Mukherjee, J. Przytycki, and A. Shumakovitch, among others. In particular, one of the main objectives in publishing this article (and this partial translation) is to popularize research in knot theory, more specifically on Khovanov homology in Colombia, and Latin-America in general, acting as a language bridge given that most of the literature is in English.",

    "title": "On the admissibility of Horvitz-Thompson estimator for estimating causal effects under network interference",
    "abstract": "The Horvitz-Thompson (H-T) estimator is widely used for estimating network causal effects. We study its optimality properties by embedding it in the class of all linear estimators. We show that, under any form of interference, the H-T estimator is inadmissible with respect to mean squared error for designs that generate a random number of units for a given treatment-exposure combination, which includes completely randomized and Bernoulli designs. In contrast, the Hajek and Ratio estimators are admissible under such designs as long as their weights exceed one. We show that the H-T estimator becomes admissible under restricted randomization schemes that fix treatment-exposure counts. These findings motivate a new estimator, the conditional horvitz-Thompson (CHT) estimator, which uses propensity scores conditional on the realized number of units in each treatment-exposure combination. We prove that the CHT estimator is unbiased and admissible for network causal effects, for any design, within the class of linear estimators. Because computing conditional propensity scores can be challenging in practice, we develop three practical approximations: an MCMC approximation and two closed-form approximations based on the difference-in-means and Ratio estimators, the first one avoids computing any propensity scores. Numerical experiments on the Add Health network illustrate the theoretical results.",

    "title": "The Limits of Assumption-free Tests for Algorithm Performance",
    "abstract": "Algorithm evaluation and comparison are fundamental questions in machine learning and statistics -- how well does an algorithm perform at a given modeling task, and which algorithm performs best? Many methods have been developed to assess algorithm performance, often based around cross-validation type strategies, retraining the algorithm of interest on different subsets of the data and assessing its performance on the held-out data points. Despite the broad use of such procedures, the theoretical properties of these methods are not yet fully understood. In this work, we explore some fundamental limits for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. In particular, we make a distinction between two questions: how good is an algorithm A at the problem of learning from a training set of size n, versus, how good is a particular fitted model produced by running A on a particular training data set of size $n$? Our main results prove that, for any test that treats the algorithm A as a ``black box'' (i.e., we can only study the behavior of A empirically), there is a fundamental limit on our ability to carry out inference on the performance of A, unless the number of available data points $N$ is many times larger than the evaluation sample size $n$ of interest. On the other hand, evaluating the performance of a particular fitted model can be easy when evaluating an algorithm is hard. We also ask whether an assumption of algorithmic stability might be sufficient to circumvent this hardness result. Surprisingly, we find that the same hardness result still holds for the problem of evaluating the performance of A, aside from a high-stability regime where fitted models are essentially nonrandom. Finally, we also establish similar hardness results for the problem of comparing multiple algorithms.",

In particular, the analytical expressions of the asymptotic behavior of the weighted sample trace moments of generalized inverse matrices are deduced in terms of the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can be easily computed in practice. The existent results for pseudo-inverses are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings provide universal methodology for construction of fully data-driven improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, optimal portfolio weights and beyond. It is found that the Moore-Penrose inverse acts asymptotically as a certain regularizer of the true covariance matrix and it seems that its proper transformation (shrinkage) performs similarly to or even outperforms the existing benchmarks in many applications, while keeping the computational time as minimal as possible.",

    "title": "Enhanced Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Short Block Transmission Systems",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and performance enhancement of short block length channel detection incorporating training information. The current communication systems' short block length channel detection typically consists of least squares channel estimation followed by quasi-coherent detection. By investigating the receiver structure, specifically the estimator-correlator, we show that the non-coherent term, often disregarded in conventional detection metrics, results in significant losses in performance and sensitivity in typical operating regimes of 5G and 6G systems. A comparison with the fully non-coherent receiver in multi-antenna configurations reveals substantial losses in low spectral efficiency operating areas. Additionally, we demonstrate that by employing an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment, it is possible to reduce the performance loss gap, which is amenable to a more sensitive quasi-coherent receiver. However, both of the aforementioned ML detection strategies can result in substantial computational complexity when processing long bit-length codes. We propose an approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block or segment coding using First-Order RM Codes, which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment technique, we are able to bridge/reduce the performance gap with respect to the conventional maximum likelihood receiver and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.",

Instead of working directly with the map, we study the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals and identify it, via the Fourier--Borel transform, with an operator on the space of entire functions of exponential type. This yields finite-dimensional approximations of the push-forward together with explicit error bounds expressed in terms of the smallest eigenvalues of certain Hankel moment matrices. Moreover, we obtain sample complexity bounds for the approximation from i.i.d.~sampled data. As a consequence, we show that linear algebraic operations on the finite-dimensional approximations can be used to reconstruct analytic vector fields from discrete trajectory data. In particular, we prove convergence of a data-driven method for recovering the vector field of an ordinary differential equation from finite-time flow map data under fairly general conditions.",

These tree recursions can, in fact, be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton--Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p>1$, for a quenched realization of $T_n$. In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on $T_n$ (with cluster weight parameter in $(0,2]$ and wired boundary condition) providing sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite third moment; (ii) $n^{-1/(\\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\\alpha \\in (1,3)$.",

We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth SDE structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification. In contrast to existing RL analyses that diverges as the sampling interval shrinks, the approximation error of PhiBE remains remains well-conditioned and independent of the discretization step by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics.

The proofs are based on novel frameworks-structured quantitative almost reducibility and sharp quantitative duality-to overcome the longstanding challenge of taming infinitely many rotation-number resonances, which enables us to obtain optimal arithmetic reducibility results for analytic SL(2,R)-cocycles, thereby solving another Jitomirskaya's conjecture. These methods enable a first comprehensive treatment of resonance-driven dynamical asymptotics.",

    "abstract": "We give a new perspective on the existence of viscosity solutions for a stationary and a time-dependent first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Following recent comparison principles, we work in a framework in which we consider a subsolution and a supersolution for two equations in terms of two Hamiltonians that can be seen as an upper semi-continuous upper and lower semi-continuous lower bound of our original Hamiltonian respectively. The bounds are made rigorous in terms of Youngs inequality. The bounds are furthermore formulated in a way that incorporate a Lyapunov function which allows us to restrict part of the analysis to compact sets and to work with almost optimizers of the considered control problems. For this reason, we can relax assumptions on the control problem: most notably, we do not need completeness of set of controlled paths. Moreover, this strategy avoids a-priori analysis on the regularity of the candidate solutions. To complete our picture, we exhibit our result in two contexts. First, we consider Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary, in which the dynamics allows for both \"inward\" and \"outward\" drift. The boundary conditions are embedded into the Hamiltonians itself. Second, we consider the solutions to a Fillipov differential equation, i.e. one with discontinuous vector field. We show that our notion of Hamiltonians leverages the natural embedding of the discontinuity in an associated set-valued differential inclusion.",

In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings.

    "abstract": "Consensus planning is a method for coordinating decision making across complex systems and organizations, including complex supply chain optimization pipelines. It arises when large interdependent distributed agents (systems) share common resources and must act in order to achieve a joint goal. In prior consensus planning work, all agents have been assumed to have the same interaction pattern (e.g., all dual agents or all primal agents or all proximal agents), most commonly using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as proximal agents. However, this is often not a valid assumption in practice, where agents consist of large complex systems, and where we might not have the luxury of modifying these large complex systems at will. In this paper, we introduce a consensus algorithm that overcomes this hurdle by allowing for the coordination of agents with different types of interfaces (named primal, dual, and proximal). Our consensus planning algorithm allows for any mix of agents by combining ADMM-like updates for the proximal agents, dual ascent updates for the dual agents, and linearized ADMM updates for the primal agents. We prove convergence results for the algorithm, namely a sublinear O(1/k) convergence rate under mild assumptions, and two-step linear convergence under stronger assumptions. We also discuss enhancements to the basic method and provide illustrative empirical results.",

Additionally, RaNNs often struggle to approximate PDE solutions with sharp gradients or discontinuities when using smooth activations and shallow architectures. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive-Growth Randomized Neural Network (AG-RaNN) to address these challenges. We first design a frequency-based initialization for a shallow RaNN. Using the residual as an error indicator, we then adaptively grow the network in width (neuron growth) and depth (layer growth) to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution. The weights and biases of new neurons are constructed rather than trained, which enhances the approximation power without additional nonlinear optimization. To handle discontinuities, we further introduce a domain splitting strategy. We also establish a unified error analysis covering approximation, statistical, and optimization errors.

Multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve when using traditional methods, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor (NSD) flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors. This work establishes a solid foundation for multiscale model-based optimization and control of the glycosylation process, supporting the implementation of quality by design.",

We study the $k$-th Tjurina algebra, defined by $ A_k(f): = \\mathcal{O} / \\left( f , m^k J(f) \\right) $, where $J(f)$ denotes the Jacobian ideal of $ f $. The zeroth Tjurina algebra is well known to represent the tangent space of the base space of the semi-universal deformation of $(X, 0)$. Motivated by this observation, we explore the deformation of $(X,0)$ with respect to a fixed $k$-residue point. We show that the tangent space of the corresponding deformation functor is a subspace of the $k$-th Tjurina algebra. Explicit calculation of the $k$-th Tjurina numbers, which correspond to the dimensions of the $k$-th Tjurina algebras, plays a crucial role in understanding these deformations. According to the results of Milnor and Orlik, the zeroth Tjurina number can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the variables in $f$. However, we observe that for values of $k$ exceeding the multiplicity of $X$, the $k$-th Tjurina number becomes more intricate and is not solely determined by the weights of the variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel complex derived from the classical Koszul complex and obtain a computable formula for the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all $ k \\geqslant 0 $.

We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.",

    "title": "Boundary corrections for kernel approximation to differential operators",
    "abstract": "Kernel-based approach to operator approximation for partial differential equations has been shown to be unconditionally stable for linear PDEs and numerically exhibit unconditional stability for non-linear PDEs. These methods have the same computational cost as an explicit finite difference scheme but can exhibit order reduction at boundaries. In previous work on periodic domains, [8,9], order reduction was addressed, yielding high-order accuracy. The issue addressed in this work is the elimination of order reduction of the kernel-based approach for a more general set of boundary conditions. Further, we consider the case of both first and second order operators. To demonstrate the theory, we provide not only the mathematical proofs but also experimental results by applying various boundary conditions to different types of equations. The results agree with the theory, demonstrating a systematic path to high order for kernel-based methods on bounded domains.",

In this model, each vertex of an infinite connected graph is the center of a ball of random radius, and vertices are said to be active independently with probability $p \\in [0, 1]$. We consider $W$ to be the reunion of random balls with an active center. In certain circumstances, the model does not exhibit a phase transition, in the sense that $W$ almost surely contains an infinite component for all $p > 0$, or even $W$ covers the entire graph. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition on the radius distribution for the existence of a subcritical phase, namely a regime such that almost surely all the connected components of $W$ are finite. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the exponential decay of the size of a typical component.",

The proposed algorithm is applicable to a broad class of constrained nonconvex minimization problems that involve nonlinear equality constraints. In a first part of this work, we conduct a full complexity analysis of the method under a mild regularity condition, leveraging an accelerated first-order algorithm for solving the Hölder-smooth subproblems. Interestingly, this worst-case result indicates that using lower powers for the augmenting term leads to faster constraint satisfaction, albeit with a slower decrease of the dual residual. Notably, our analysis does not assume boundedness of the iterates. Thereafter, we present an inexact proximal point method for solving the weakly-convex and Hölder-smooth subproblems, and demonstrate that the combined scheme attains an improved rate that reduces to the best-known convergence rate whenever the augmenting term is a classical squared Euclidean norm. Different augmenting terms, involving a lower power, further improve the primal complexity at the cost of the dual complexity. Finally, numerical experiments validate the practical performance of unconventional augmenting terms.",

We prove the validity of Kubo formula, in the zero temperature and infinite volume limit, for a class of perturbations that are weak and slowly varying in space and in time, in an Euler-like scaling. The proof relies on the representation of the real time Duhamel series in imaginary time, which allows to prove its convergence uniformly in the scaling parameter and in the size of system, at low temperatures. Furthermore, it allows to exploit a suitable cancellation for the scaling limit of the model, related to the emergent anomalous chiral gauge symmetry of relativistic one-dimensional fermions. The cancellation implies that, as the temperature and the scaling parameter are sent to zero, the linear response is the only contribution to the full response of the system. The explicit form of the leading contribution to the response function is determined by lattice conservation laws. In particular, the method allows to prove the quantization of the edge conductance of $2d$ quantum Hall systems from quantum dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.",

    "abstract": "Establishing Lipschitz stability estimates is crucial for ensuring the mathematical robustness of neural network (NN) approximations in machine learning (ML)-based parameter estimation, particularly in physics-informed settings. In this work, we derive such estimates for the inverse of a nonlinear map defined on a manifold that captures both unknown parameters and the nonlinear physical processes they influence. Our analysis is based on finite-dimensional, learnable representations of the manifold and provides Lipschitz stability estimates on the manifold-based subspaces, for a class of inverse maps associated with parameter dependent linear compact operators. Such operators model scattered and far-field data that can be used to detect structures such as cracks. We apply our theoretical ML manifold framework to inverse Helmholtz problems in unbounded regions exterior to cracks, addressing the scattered-field data-driven inverse problem while ensuring injectivity conditions on the manifold, a requirement for the Lipschitz stability. Our method accurately recovers crack-defining parameters without requiring prior knowledge of inputs such as incident wave types or external forces on the crack. Numerical experiments using NN approximations confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach.",

    "title": "Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks",
    "abstract": "Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.",

    "abstract": "The Ruzsa-Szemerédi $(6,3)$-problem can be equivalently stated as determining the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles on $n$ vertices such that no triangle is formed by edges from three distinct triangle-copies. Gowers and Janzer extended this problem by establishing an analogous result for complete graphs. A natural generalization of the two results, first introduced by Imolay, Karl, Nazy and Váli, asks for the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of a graph $F$ on $n$ vertices such that no copy of $G$ is formed by edges originating from distinct $F$-copies. This maximum number, denoted by $ex_F(n,G)$, is called the {\\em $F$-multicolor Turán number} of $G$. This paper focuses on the setting of uniform hypergraphs. We first prove that for $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{F}$, $ex_{\\mathcal{F}}(n,\\mathcal{G})=o(n^k)$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $\\mathcal{G}$ to $\\mathcal{F}$. For degenerate case, we show that $ex_{\\mathcal{F}}(n,\\mathcal{G})=n^{k-o(1)}$ whenever $\\mathcal{G}$ contains a $k$-uniform tight triangle. These results extend previous results. We further establish corresponding supersaturation and blowup statements. In the non-degenerate setting, we derive matching lower and upper bounds for $ex_{\\mathcal{F}}(n,\\mathcal{G})$. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for $ex_{\\mathcal{F}}(n,\\mathcal{G})$ to fail to attain the upper bound, under the assumption that the extremal graphs for $\\mathcal{G}$ are stable. As an application, we refine a result due to Imolay, Karl, Nazy and Váli. Furthermore, we completely characterize $\\mathcal{F}$ for which $ex_{\\mathcal{F}}(n,\\mathcal{G})$ does not attain the upper bound when $\\mathcal{G}$ is one of the three special intersecting graphs: Fano plane, extended triangle and $r$-book of $r$-edges with $r=3,4$.",

From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erdös about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.",

    "abstract": "(abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Martínez-Pedroza, and Rodríguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators. We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Martínez-Pedroza, and Rodríguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Martínez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\\infty$. We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.",

In contrast to the well studied isotropic case, these systems are well suited for the direction sensitive analysis of anisotropic features such as edges. The price paid for this is the fact that at each scale the wavelet transform lives on the rotation group $SO(d)$, and not on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ as in the zonal setting. Thus, the standard approach of building discrete frames by sampling the continuous wavelet transform requires a significantly larger amount of sample points. However, by keeping the directionality limited, this number can be greatly reduced to the point where it is comparable to the number of samples needed in the isotropic case. Moreover, the limited directionality is reflected in the wavelets being steerable and their great localization in space leads to a fast convergence of the wavelet expansion in the spaces $L^p(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $1\\leq p \\leq \\infty$.",

Initially, the model's solutions are confirmed to be both nonnegative and bounded for nonnegative initial values. Subsequently, two biologically critical parameters were identified: the virus reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ and the immune reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_1$. Thereafter, by invoking LaSalle's principle of invariance alongside Lyapunov functionals, we establish stability criteria for each equilibrium. The results indicate that the stability of the endemic equilibrium may be altered by a positive immune delay, whereas intracellular and viral replication delays do not affect the equilibria. By considering the delay in the immune response as a bifurcation-inducing threshold, we derive the exact conditions necessary for these stability transitions. Further analysis shows that increasing the immune delay destabilizes the endemic equilibrium, inducing a Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, using the center manifold theorem and normal form theory, we explored the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcations in detail.

    "abstract": "Dey and Xin ( this http URL ., 2022, arXiv:1904.03766 ) describe an algorithm to decompose finitely presented multiparameter persistence modules using a matrix reduction algorithm. Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \\emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \\textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation.",

    "title": "Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication",
    "abstract": "As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain reliability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge, which may be part of the training set of the SemCom system, between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into a digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding based on the shared index of Y2, while the eavesdropper's decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves security comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.",

The pair $(\\lambda,\\phi)$ also provides information on limit behavior of related optimization problems, for instance, results of Abelian-Tauberian type or limits of value functions of control problems for finite time horizon when the latter tends to infinity.

Existing methods often rely on costly projection or linear optimization oracles over complex sets, limiting their scalability. To overcome this, we propose an iteratively regularized conditional gradient approach that leverages linear optimization oracles exclusively over the base feasible set. Our proposed methods employ a vanishing regularization sequence that progressively emphasizes the inner problem while biasing towards desirable minimal outer objective solutions. In the one-sample stochastic setting and under standard convexity assumptions, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates of $O(t^{-1/4})$ for both the outer and inner objectives. In the finite-sum setting with a mini-batch scheme, the corresponding rates become $O(t^{-1/2})$. When the outer objective is nonconvex, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates of $O(t^{-1/7})$ for both the outer and inner objectives in the one-sample stochastic setting, and $O(t^{-1/4})$ in the finite-sum setting. Experimental results on over-parametrized regression and dictionary learning tasks demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach over existing methods, confirming our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Schr{ö}dinger bridge problem in discrete time, where the pathwise cost is replaced by a sum of quadratic functions, taking the form of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. This cost comprises potential terms that act as attractors and kinetic terms that control the diffusion of the process. When the two boundary marginals are Gaussian, we show that the LQR-Schr{ö}dinger bridge problem can be solved in closed form. We follow the dynamic programming principle, interpreting the Kantorovich potentials as cost-to-go functions. Under the LQR-Gaussian assumption, these potentials can be propagated exactly in a backward and forward passes, leading to a system of dual Riccati equations, well known in estimation and control. This system converges rapidly in practice. We then show that the optimal process is Markovian and compute its transition kernel in closed form as well as the Gaussian marginals. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to construct complex, non-homogeneous Gaussian processes with acceleration and loops, given well-chosen attractive potentials. Moreover, this approach allows extending the Bures transport between Gaussian distributions to more complex geometries with negative curvature.",

    "title": "Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures",
    "abstract": "In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes uniformly distributed across $\\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies $k=\\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\\leq v\\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\\geq1$ failed nodes in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the host rack downloads recovery data from $\\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all $\\bar{k}+1\\leq\\bar{d}\\leq\\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization $l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases linearly with $n$ and $\\bar{s}=\\bar{d}-\\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\\leq h\\leq u-v$, and asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\\leq h\\leq u$. In particular, they achieve optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization $l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ are only known for the special case of $\\bar{d}=\\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours. Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization $l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/(\\bar{s}+1)\\rceil}$ for all admissible values of $\\bar{d}$.",

This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which handles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations. Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to the pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$ is a twist of $f'$. Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a unified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based on their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters, Sato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions.

To construct the random walk and prove the convergence result, we employ a technique due to Fefferman and Phong, which reduces the problem to the study of a constant-coefficient operator $\\tilde{A}$ that is locally equivalent to our second-order subelliptic operator $A$, in the sense that the diffusion generated by $\\tilde{A}$ induces a local diffusion for $A$. By using the compactness of $M$ this local diffusion can be lifted to a global diffusion, and the convergence result is then obtained via the spectral theory of the associated Markov operator.",

We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption. Finally, we investigate whether a recently proposed approach based on convexification yields better reconstructions.

The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\\mathbb Q$, which clearly is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, de la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and also their modifications, such as the auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to clearly indicate which of its parts are not explicit.",

To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.",

While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct classes. First, we introduce and classify \\emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general \\emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three, we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain fields.",

Specifically, we consider $N$ independent stochastic processes, each driven by a linear combination of standard Brownian motion and an independent fractional Brownian motion, and governed by a drift term that depends on an unobserved random effect with unknown distribution. Based on discrete-time statistics of process increments, we construct parametric estimators for the Brownian motion volatility, the scaling parameter for the fractional Brownian motion, and the Hurst parameter using a generalized method of moments. We establish strong consistency and joint asymptotic normality of these estimators. Then, from one trajectory, we consistently estimate the random effects, using a plug-in approach, and we study their asymptotic behavior under different asymptotic regimes as $N$ and $n$ grow. Finally, we construct a nonparametric estimator for the distribution function of these random effects using a Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev-Gauss nodes based method, and we analyze its asymptotic properties as both the number of subjects $N$ and the number of observations per-subject $n$ increase. A numerical simulation framework is also investigated to illustrate the theoretical results of the estimators behavior.",

This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$.

A tipping phenomenon is characterized by a rapid transition resulting from the accumulation of small parameter changes and is known to be related to bifurcations of dynamical systems. However, few studies have examined how nonlinear properties near bifurcation points affect early warning signal (EWS) performance. In this study, we apply the Koopman operator, which describes the time evolution of dynamical systems in an infinite-dimensional function space, to generalize stochastic resilience the theoretical basis of EWSs such as variance-based ones. As a result, we develop a novel signal capable of more accurately predicting tipping events by separately isolating stochastic fluctuations induced by noise and contributions from a continuous spectrum emerging immediately above tipping points. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach detects early signs of tipping phenomena more robustly than conventional methods.",

The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.",

We associate to each primitive S-adic directivesequence ${\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ a $\\textit{profinite image}$ in the free profinite semigroup over the alphabet of the induced minimal shift space.

This offers new insights into the topological behavior of generic solutions to the Ricci flow in four dimensions: on top of reversing connected sums and handle surgeries, they should also undo complex blow-ups. The proof starts from an explicit description of the metric and develops a tensor harmonic analysis, adapted to its weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian and based on its $U(2)$-invariance. It further exploits the Kähler structure of the blowdown shrinking soliton and insights from four-dimensional selfduality. The main difficulty is that the weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian of the soliton admits a $9$-dimensional set of eigentensors associated with nonnegative eigenvalues. We show that they correspond to the Ricci tensor and gauge transformations.",

To enhance the stability of the reconstruction, we incorporate a parameter-dependent coupled complex boundary method together with perimeter and volume regularizations. Source support is represented by a level set function, allowing the algorithm to naturally accommodate topological changes and recover multiple, closely spaced, or nested source regions.

This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.",

    "abstract": "We exhibit two instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon - one on dissections of a polygon of a fixed type and one on triangulations of a once-punctured polygon. We use these results to give refined enumerations of certain families of frieze patterns. We also give an interpretation of finite, positive integral frieze patterns fixed under nontrivial rotations as frieze patterns from a family of orbifolds and show that these are always unitary. Finally, we give a bijection between Holm-Jorgensen frieze patterns and p-Dyck paths, extending a recent construction of Canadas, Espinosa, Gaviria, and Rios, and discuss an induced rotation map on Dyck paths. Several conjectures and questions for future study are highlighted throughout the article.",

    "title": "Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems",
    "abstract": "Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter.",

This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions.

In this work we remove the need for such conditions by localizing to an affine subspace -- the joint supporting subspace -- that contains the feasible region and ensures qualification conditions hold after localization. Our theory generalizes Borwein and Wolkowicz's facial reduction beyond conic programs to convex programs of the form $f(x) + g(Ax)$. Intuitively, the joint supporting subspace corresponds to a bilateral facial reduction between any two convex sets. It enables simple qualification-free generalizations for a host of central results of convex analysis. These include: an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions; attained infimal convolution for convex conjugates; subdifferential sum and chain rules; and a characterization of the normal cones of the intersection of two convex sets. All generalizations reduce seamlessly to their original formulations when qualification conditions hold. We offer a number of characterizations for the joint supporting subspace, one of which is constructive. Our proofs are self-contained, and introduce a novel theoretical framework consisting of nested normals and supporting subspaces, which simultaneously describe both the boundary of convex sets and the lattice of faces.",

A fundamental problem is to determine the maximum size of such a family. The trivial lower bound of $2^{\\binom{n}{2} - e(H)}$ is known to be not sharp for some graphs, such as the $P_4$ graph, as shown by Christofides. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we introduce a general construction for $H$-intersecting families based on decompositions of complete multipartite graphs, yielding new lower bounds for $H = K_{s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}, t}$. We compare this construction to a result by Balogh and Linz, showing that our bound is valid for a substantially wider range of parameters (beginning at $t \\ge 2^{\\sum_i s_i}$) and provides a stronger numerical bound for a large interval where both constructions are applicable. Second, we conjecture the $\\frac{17}{128}$ Christofides bound for $P_4$ is optimal, which would resolve the Alon-Spencer conjecture. We computationally verify this density is optimal for families generated by connected 6-vertex host graphs with 7 or 8 edges.",

The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of (finite-rank) compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\\Omega $: If $\\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.",

We derive explicit distance formulas for all cases of constant flag curvature. For non-positive constant curvature, we establish a global classification of forward complete manifolds, a uniqueness theorem for forward complete metrics, and a characterization of maximal domains of metrics where exotic examples are constructed. For positive constant curvature, we prove a maximum diameter theorem and show the completion of such manifold is a sphere.

This advantage makes it possible to apply our method to the fixed angle inverse scattering problem, which remains unresolved for the single incident wave case. To achieve our result, we impose certain pointwise positivity assumption on the difference of initial conditions. The assumption generalizes previous stability results that usually assume the difference to be zero. We propose the initial-potential problem and prove a potential inverse stable recovery result of it. The initial-potential problem serves as an attempt to relate initial boundary value problem with the scattering problem, and to explore the possibility to relax the positivity requirement on the initial data.

    "abstract": "Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. We explicitly give the framings of the lower-dimensional moduli spaces of the Manolescu-Sarkar construction as well as the more general moduli spaces corresponding to the full grid. Though in the latter case the stable homotopy type is not known, the explicit framings are enough to construct a framed 1-flow category, a construction by Lobb-Orson-Schütz which contains enough information to find the second Steenrod square. Finally, we find an algorithm for computing the second Steenrod square for all versions of grid homology coming from the full grid.",

We give a parallel proof for classical permutation patterns that stays entirely in the ``grow from the right'' world of enumerative combinatorics. A $v$-avoiding permutation is built by right insertion; at each step we keep a pruned family of locations of $(k{-}1)$-partial occurrences of $v$ (the \\emph{frontier}), each carrying its forbidden rank interval. The insertion step then induces a nonnegative transfer operator on a doubly weighted $\\ell^\\infty$ space. A quadratic penalty in the length makes this operator bounded, and a Neumann-series argument on a natural separable predual yields analyticity of the growth series, hence finite exponential growth for $\\Av(v)$. The formulation is completely internal -- we never pass to $0$--$1$ matrices -- and it cleanly separates the pattern-dependent combinatorics of the frontier from a purely operator-theoretic core. In particular, we obtain an abstract ``right-insertion/transfer-operator'' theorem: any system whose frontier grows at most linearly and whose transfer operator satisfies a uniform quadratic length bound has an analytic growth series.",

Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.",

Our result follows from a new geometric characterization of Bourgain's condition based on the structure of curved $\\delta$-tubes in a $\\delta^{1/2}$-tube. We find examples in all dimensions at least 3 which show this property does not persist in a larger tube, and in particular these are the first operators satisfying Bourgain's condition for which there is no diffeomorphism taking the corresponding families of curves to lines.

Any total order of $N$ can be interpreted as a node of a particular graph, called the permutohedral graph (over $N$), because it is indeed the graph of a certain polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as the permutohedron. It is shown in the paper that a non-empty set of total orders of $N$ equals to ${\\cal L}(P)$ for some poset $P$ on $N$ iff it is a geodetically convex set in the permutohedral graph. This result means that a purely graphical concept of geodetical convexity in this graph is a cryptomorphic definition of a finite poset. In particular, the lattice of geodetically convex sets in this graph is graded and its height function is described in graphical terms. A counter-example, however, shows that the height function does not correspond to the usual graphical diameter, relating this matter to a combinatorial concept of the dimension of a poset. Two alternative cryptomorphic views on a poset $P$ on $N$ are also briefly commented.

We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.",

Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_N\\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable.

We offer a unifying framework for obtaining informative summaries and propose a practical method using conditional density estimation to learn high-fidelity summaries automatically. We evaluate this approach on diverse problems, including a challenging benchmark model with a multi-modal posterior, a population genetics model, and a dynamic network model of growing trees.

This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive (top-down) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative (bottom-up) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a linkage method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their applications in network analysis.",

    "abstract": "Permutation pattern-avoidance is a central concept of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics. In this paper we study the effect of permutation pattern-avoidance on the complexity of optimization problems. In the context of the dynamic optimality conjecture (Sleator, Tarjan, STOC 1983), Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn, and Saranurak (FOCS 2015) conjectured that the amortized search cost of an optimal binary search tree (BST) is constant whenever the search sequence is pattern-avoiding. The best known bound to date is $2^{\\alpha{(n)}(1+o(1))}$ recently obtained by Chalermsook, Pettie, and Yingchareonthawornchai (SODA 2024); here $n$ is the BST size and $\\alpha(\\cdot)$ the inverse-Ackermann function. In this paper we resolve the conjecture, showing a tight $O(1)$ bound. This indicates a barrier to dynamic optimality: any candidate online BST (e.g., splay trees or greedy trees) must match this optimum, but current analysis techniques only give superconstant bounds. More broadly, we argue that the easiness of pattern-avoiding input is a general phenomenon, not limited to BSTs or even to data structures. To illustrate this, we show that when the input avoids an arbitrary, fixed, a priori unknown pattern, one can efficiently compute a $k$-server solution of $n$ requests from a unit interval, with total cost $n^{O(1/\\log k)}$, in contrast to the worst-case $\\Theta(n/k)$ bound; and a traveling salesman tour of $n$ points from a unit box, of length $O(\\log{n})$, in contrast to the worst-case $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ bound; similar results hold for the euclidean minimum spanning tree, Steiner tree, and nearest-neighbor graphs. We show both results to be tight. Our techniques build on the Marcus-Tardos proof of the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, and on the recently emerging concept of twin-width.",

To precisely and adaptively locate the critical regions that fail in the solving process we propose a sampling strategy grounded in white-box adversarial attacks, referred to as WbAR. WbAR search for failure regions in the direction of the loss gradient, thus directly locating the most critical positions. WbAR generates adversarial samples in a random walk manner and iteratively refines PINNs to guide the model's focus towards dynamically updated critical regions during training. We implement WbAR to the elliptic equation with multi-scale coefficients, Poisson equation with multi-peak solutions, high-dimensional Poisson equations, and Burgers equation with sharp solutions. The results demonstrate that WbAR can effectively locate and reduce failure regions. Moreover, WbAR is suitable for solving complex PDEs, since locating failure regions through adversarial attacks is independent of the size of failure regions or the complexity of the distribution.",

To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \\emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \\emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art methods for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices all shrink the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix towards a data-insensitive shrinkage target. The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real data show that our robust estimators are competitive with state-of-the-art estimators.",

Our convex relaxation enables deterministic, interpretable solutions with proven convergence properties via the Splitting Conic Solver (SCS). We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to classical baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times.

We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. In local dimension d <= 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. We construct a new family of states for which the properties of PPT and separability can be characterized for all dimensions, generalizing results from the literature. Our results show that this class of symmetric states has a rich entanglement structure, even in the bosonic subspace.",

Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.",

In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.",

Finding a T -odd orientation of G can be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong (1983). Since then, $T$-odd orientations have continued to attract interest, particularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For instance, Frank and Király (2002) investigated $k$-connected $T$-odd orientations and raised questions about acyclic $T$-odd orientations. This problem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the \"Acyclic orientation with parity constraints\" problem. Szegedy ( 005) proposed a randomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of his work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever $|T | = |V | - 1$. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem by studying a more general one.

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.",

A key task in network analysis is community detection, which typically consists of dividing the nodes into groups such that nodes within a group are strongly connected, while connections between groups are relatively scarce. A generative model well suited for the formation of such communities is the assortative stochastic block model (SBM), which prescribes a higher probability of a connection between nodes belonging to the same block rather than to different blocks. A recent line of work has utilized Bayesian nonparametric methods to recover communities in the SBM by placing a prior distribution on the number of blocks and estimating block assignments via collapsed Gibbs samplers. However, efficiently incorporating the assortativity constraint through the prior remains an open problem. In this work, we address this gap by studying the effect of enforcing assortativity on Bayesian community detection and identifying the scenarios in which it pays dividends in comparison with standard SBM.

We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way. * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\\Theta(\\log^\\xi \\log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\\xi=\\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively. * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of \"highways.\" It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach. * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\\mathscr{D}$.

In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct effective mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.",

    "abstract": "Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.",

    "abstract": "In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

In particular, the reconstruction is facilitated when the sensing matrix is i.i.d. random, enabling strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms. However, its applicability is restricted by excessive computational costs. In this paper, we propose structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We reduce the complexity from quadratic to log-linear at no cost in reconstruction performance. Through a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular-value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.",

In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified.

Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines a \\textbf{topological string theory} where the action is proportional to the area of the conformal map of the 2D disk, possessing no bulk quantum fluctuations. The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and the perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{pert}[C] e^{- \\kappa S[C]}$. This corresponds to a non-perturbative gluon condensate vacuum supporting planar graph fluctuations. We prove the inequality $S[C] \\ge \\sqrt{2} A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), establishing a sufficient condition for confinement. The area law is defined explicitly as $S[C] = 2\\sqrt{2} (\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_4)$ using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity.

ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.",

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.",

Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling. Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines.

    "title": "Complete strategy spaces reveal hidden pathways to cooperation",
    "abstract": "Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists is a central challenge in evolutionary game theory. Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation.",

Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition. Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs. Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics. Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration.

While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy.",

Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis.

For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings.

Some species show high levels of socio-cognitive abilities that enable them to perceive communicational gestures of humans and use them for their own benefit. This study investigated the ability of Indian free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) to utilise human social-referential cues (pointing and gazing) to locate hidden food, focusing on the relative effectiveness of unimodal versus multimodal cues. A total of 352 adult free-ranging dogs were tested in an object-choice task involving six different cue conditions: control (no cue), negative control (one baited bowl, no cue), combined pointing and gazing, pointing-only, gazing-only, and conflicting cues (pointing and gazing at opposite bowls). The dogs successfully chose the correct target only in the combined pointing and gazing condition, while performance under unimodal and conflicting cue conditions did not differ significantly from chance. This highlights the importance of signal redundancy and clarity in interspecific communication for this population. A dog's demeanor was a significant predictor of its willingness to engage: affiliative dogs were significantly more likely to succeed in the overall experiment and displayed a significantly shorter approach latency compared to anxious and neutral dogs. While demeanor affected the approach latency, it did not affect the accuracy of the choice, decoupling the dogs' personality from its cognitive ability to comprehend the clear cue. Neither the dogs' sex nor the experimental condition significantly predicted approach latency.",

Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.",

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.",

The aggregation behaviour in vitro is well understood and driven by the equilibration of a super-saturated protein solution to its aggregated equilibrium state. However, the situation is altered fundamentally in living systems where active processes consume energy to remove aggregates. It remains unclear how and why cells transition from a state with predominantly monomeric protein, which is stable over decades, to one dominated by aggregates. Here, we develop a simple but universal theoretical framework to describe cellular systems that include both aggregate formation and removal. Using a two-dimensional phase-plane representation, we show that the interplay of aggregate formation and removal generates cell-level bistability, with a bifurcation structure that explains both the emergence of disease and the effects of therapeutic interventions. We explore a wide range of aggregate formation and removal mechanisms and show that phenomena such as seeding arise robustly when a minimal set of requirements on the mechanism are satisfied. By connecting in vitro aggregation mechanisms to changes in cell state, our framework provides a general conceptual link between molecular-level therapeutic interventions and their impact on disease progression.",

The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.",

Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects.",

Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.",

    "abstract": "Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology. We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics. Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.",

Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.",

To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity.

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.",

    "title": "Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators",
    "abstract": "Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations. Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products. We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn transferable representation across domains. Recently a few UDA works have successfully applied Transformer-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, it remains challenging when there exists a large domain gap between the source and target domain. Inspired by humans' exceptional transferability abilities to adapt knowledge from familiar to uncharted domains, we try to apply the universally existing organizational structure in the human functional brain networks, i.e., the core-periphery principle to design the Transformer and improve its UDA performance. In this paper, we propose a novel brain-inspired robust core-periphery constrained transformer (RCCT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which brings a large margin of performance improvement on various datasets. Specifically, in RCCT, the self-attention operation across image patches is rescheduled by an adaptively learned weighted graph with the Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the information communication and exchange between images patches are manipulated and controlled by the connection strength, i.e., edge weight of the learned weighted CP graph. Besides, since the data in domain adaptation tasks can be noisy, to improve the model robustness, we intentionally add perturbations to the patches in the latent space to ensure generating robust learned weighted core-periphery graphs. Extensive evaluations are conducted on several widely tested UDA benchmarks. Our proposed RCCT consistently performs best compared to existing works, including 88.3\\% on Office-Home, 95.0\\% on Office-31, 90.7\\% on VisDA-2017, and 46.0\\% on DomainNet.",

Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue.

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.",

We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.",

Applied to a curated dataset of experimentally characterized flagellar motors from diverse bacterial species, our model demonstrates high classification accuracy and robustness to structural variation. This approach highlights the power of topological data analysis in revealing functionally relevant patterns beyond the reach of traditional geometric descriptors, offering a novel computational tool for protein function prediction.",

However, their application in the biomedical domain presents unique challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date knowledge integration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. This comprehensive survey examines the application of RAG in the biomedical domain, focusing on its technological components, available datasets, and clinical applications. We present a systematic analysis of retrieval methods, ranking strategies, and generation models, while also exploring the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.",

Traditional empirical methods based on physicochemical properties are prone to systematic misjudgements due to their reliance on static rules. Early machine learning models, although data-driven, often suffer from limited capacity, poor generalization, and insufficient interpretability. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become essential tools for predicting BBB permeability and guiding related drug design, owing to their ability to model molecular structures and capture complex biological mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the evolution of this field-from deep neural networks to graph-based structural modeling-highlighting the advantages of multi-task and multimodal learning strategies in identifying mechanism-relevant variables. We further explore the emerging potential of generative models and causal inference methods for integrating permeability prediction with mechanism-aware drug design. BBB modeling is in the transition from static classification toward mechanistic perception and structure-function modeling.

Single-cell technologies enable high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type. Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type, limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous, time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling, CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways. These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.",

Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels.

We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",

However, its complexity arises from multi-branched tree-structured pathways rather than linear paths.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel gradient-propagation-based algorithmic framework for retrosynthetic route exploration. The proposed framework obtains the contributions of different nodes to the target molecule's success probability through gradient propagation and then guides the algorithm to greedily select the node with the highest contribution for expansion, thereby conducting efficient search in the chemical space. Experimental validations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves broad applicability across diverse molecular targets and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods.",

By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations.

    "abstract": "Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method against latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.",

The model is applied to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, and its performance is evaluated for both yield-space and price-space predictions at 1-day and 5-day horizons. Empirically, arbitrage regularization leads to its strongest improvements at short maturities, particularly in 5-day-ahead forecasts, increasing market-consistency as measured by bid-ask hit rates and reducing dollar-denominated prediction errors.",

    "title": "A multi-view contrastive learning framework for spatial embeddings in risk modelling",
    "abstract": "Incorporating spatial information, particularly those influenced by climate, weather, and demographic factors, is crucial for improving underwriting precision and enhancing risk management in insurance. However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.",

The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical mesoscopic model of the limit order book driven by multivariate Hawkes processes, designed to capture temporal self-excitation and the spatial propagation of order flow across price levels. In contrast to classical zero-intelligence or Poisson based queueing models, the proposed framework introduces mathematically defined migration events between neighbouring price levels, whose intensities are themselves governed by the underlying Hawkes structure. This provides a principled stochastic mechanism for modeling interactions between order arrivals, cancellations, and liquidity movement across adjacent queues. Starting from a microscopic specification of Hawkes driven order flow, we derive a diffusion approximation which yields a reflected mesoscopic stochastic differential equation (SDE) system for queue volumes. The limiting generator is obtained through a Taylor expansion of the microscopic generator, demonstrating how temporal excitation together with spatial migration determine the drift and diffusion structure of the limit order book in the mesoscopic regime. The resulting model extends existing diffusion limits by incorporating correlated excitations and price level to price level liquidity movement within a unified Hawkes based formulation. By establishing this diffusive limit, the paper provides a mathematically consistent bridge between high frequency event based models and macroscopic stochastic descriptions of market microstructure. The work is entirely theoretical and lays a foundation for future analytical and numerical developments without relying on empirical calibration.",

The possible outcomes at a scale of a few decades can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a probability density for the possible portfolio values at the investment horizon. Such studies are critical for long term wealth plannings, for example in the financial component of social insurances or in accumulated capital for retirement. The quality of the results depends on two inputs: the process used for the simulations and its parameters. The base model is a constant drift, a constant covariance and normal innovations, as pioneered by Bachelier. Beyond this model, this document presents in details a multivariate process that incorporate the most recent advances in the models for financial time series. This includes the negative correlations of the returns at a scale of a few years, the heteroskedasticity (i.e. the volatility' dynamics), and the fat tails and asymmetry for the distributions of returns. For the parameters, the quantitative outcomes depend critically on the estimate for the drift, because this is a non random contribution acting at each time step. Replacing the point forecast by a probabilistic forecast allows us to analyze the impact of the drift values, and then to incorporate this uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations.",

By relying on a simple Black-Scholes-type market model for mid-prices and using continuous trading schemes, we define a dynamic family of superhedging sets in continuous time and express them in terms of set-valued integrals. We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets.",

This study examines the relationship between access to finance and food security among smallholder farmers in Ogun State, employing institutional theory as a theoretical framework. The study takes a quantitative method, with a survey for the research design and a population of 37,200 agricultural smallholder farmers. A sample size of 380 was chosen using probability sampling and simple random techniques. The data were analysed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate a favourable relationship between access to finance and food security, with an R2-value of 0.615 indicating a robust link. These findings underline the need of improving financial institutions and implementing enabling policies to enable farmers have access to the financial resources they need to achieve food security outcomes.",

This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.",

I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.",

The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.",

This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior.",

In our classical simulations, we keep the Hilbert-space dimension manageable by decomposing each sentence into short contiguous chunks. Each chunk is mapped to a shallow quantum circuit, and the resulting Bloch vectors are used as a sequence of quantum tokens. Simple averaging of chunk vectors ignores word order and syntactic roles. We therefore add a small Transformer encoder over the raw Bloch-vector sequence and attach a CCG-based type embedding to each chunk. This hybrid design preserves physically interpretable semantic axes of quantum tokens while allowing the classical side to model word order and long-range dependencies. The sequence model improves test macro-F1 over the averaging baseline and chunk-level attribution further shows that evidential mass concentrates on a small number of chunks, that type embeddings are used more reliably for correctly predicted sentences. For real-world quantum language processing applications in finance, future key challenges include circuit designs that avoid chunking and the design of inter-chunk fusion layers.",

We model the risky assets' dynamics using geometric Brownian motions whose drift rates are modulated by an unobservable common stochastic factor to capture market-specific or economy-wide state variables that are typically not directly observable. Using classical stochastic filtering theory, we formulate a suitable optimization problem and solve it for CRRA utility function. We characterise optimal carbon penalised PPI strategies and optimal value functions under full and partial information and quantify the loss of utility due incomplete information. Finally, we carry a numerical analysis showing that the proposed strategy reduces carbon emission intensity without compromising financial performance.",

Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets.",

This unified design preserves economically meaningful GARCH parameters while enabling the networks to learn nonlinear temporal dependencies in financial time series. Comprehensive out-of-sample evaluations across major U.S. equity indices show that both models consistently outperform classical GARCH specifications, pipeline-style hybrids, and neural baselines such as the Transformer across multiple metrics (MSE, MAE, SMAPE, and out-of-sample R\\textsuperscript{2}). Within this family, the GARCH-GRU achieves the strongest accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, training nearly three times faster than GARCH-LSTM while maintaining comparable or superior forecasting accuracy under normal market conditions and delivering stable and economically plausible parameter estimates. The advantages persist during extreme market turbulence. In the COVID-19 stress period, both architectures retain superior forecasting accuracy and deliver well-calibrated 99 percent Value-at-Risk forecasts, achieving lower violation ratios and competitive Pinball losses relative to all benchmarks. Overall, the findings underscore the effectiveness of embedding GARCH dynamics within recurrent neural architectures, yielding models that are accurate, efficient, interpretable, and robust for real-world risk-aware volatility forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.",

We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).",

Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients. For both quantum and classical models, the only tuned quantities are the feature-mixing weights and the KRR ridge alpha; classical hyperparameters (gamma, r, d) are fixed, with the same validation set size for all models.

Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.",

We demonstrate that this formulation extends both spatial models into a unified spatiotemporal framework, expressing them as Gaussian Markov random fields in their innovation form. The resulting model captures spatial, temporal, and joint spatiotemporal correlations in an interpretable way. Simulation studies show that the proposed model outperforms common ad hoc imputation strategies, such as replacing censored values with the limit of detection (LOD) or imputing missing data by the sample mean. We further apply the method to carbon monoxide (CO) concentration data from Beijing's air quality network, comparing the proposed DAGAR-AR model with the traditional Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) approach. The results indicate that while the CAR model achieves slightly better predictive performance, the DAGAR-AR specification offers clearer interpretability and a more coherent representation of the spatiotemporal dependence structure.",

The framework yields estimates of $R_t$ and relative infections, enabling a coherent interpretation of transmission timing and phase. We compare two input strategies-(i) raw viral-load measurements with a log-scale standard deviation, and (ii) state-space-filtered load estimates with time-varying variances-and find no practically meaningful differences in inferred trajectories or peak timing. Given this equivalence, we report the filtered input as a pragmatic default because it embeds week-specific variances while leaving epidemiological conclusions unchanged.",

    "abstract": "Doubly robust estimators (DRE) are widely used in causal inference because they yield consistent estimators of average causal effect when at least one of the nuisance models, the propensity for treatment (exposure) or the outcome regression, is correct. However, double robustness does not extend to variance estimation; the influence-function (IF)-based variance estimator is consistent only when both nuisance parameters are correct. This raises concerns about applying DRE in practice, where model misspecification is inevitable. The recent paper by Shook-Sa et al. (2025, Biometrics, 81(2), ujaf054) demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations that the IF-based variance estimator is biased. However, the paper's findings are empirical. The key question remains: why does the variance estimator fail in double robustness, and under what conditions do alternatives succeed, such as the ones demonstrated in Shook-Sa et al. 2025. In this paper, we develop a formal theory to clarify the efficiency properties of DRE that underlie these empirical findings. We also introduce alternative strategies, including a mixture-based framework underlying the sample-splitting and crossfitting approaches, to achieve valid inference with misspecified nuisance parameters. Our considerations are illustrated with simulation and real study data.",

By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.",

Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).",

We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy. Over a 300 day period and for a range of cost parameters, both controllers substantially reduce ICU burden relative to the observed interventions, illustrating how Bayesian sequential learning combined with RL can support the design of epidemic control policies.",

This works investigates the impact of the order in which the W and FR operator are evaluated and aims to provide a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that with a judicious choice of step size and operator ordering, the split scheme can converge to the target distribution faster than the exact WFR flow (in terms of model time). We obtain variational formulae describing the evolution over one time step of both sequential splitting schemes and investigate in which settings the W-FR split should be preferred to the FR-W split. As a step towards this goal we show that the WFR gradient flow preserves log-concavity and obtain the first sharp decay bound for WFR.",

In the standard multinomial bootstrap, the number of distinct observations in each resample is random. Although this source of variability exists, it has rarely been studied in isolation to understand how much it affects OOB-based quantities. To address this gap, we investigate Sequential Bootstrap, a resampling method that forces every bootstrap replicate to contain the same number of distinct observations, and treat it as a controlled modification of the classical bootstrap within the OOB framework. We reproduce Breiman's five original OOB experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, repeating all analyses across many different random seeds. Our results show that switching from the classical bootstrap to Sequential Bootstrap leaves accuracy-related metrics essentially unchanged, but yields measurable and data-dependent reductions in several variance-related measures. Therefore, Sequential Bootstrap should not be viewed as a new method for improving predictive performance, but rather as a tool for understanding how randomness in the number of distinct samples contributes to the variance of OOB estimators. This work provides a reproducible setting for studying the statistical properties of resampling-based ensemble estimators and offers empirical evidence that may support future theoretical work on variance decomposition in bootstrap-based systems.",

    "abstract": "Background: Non-inferiority studies based on non-randomised data are increasingly used in clinical research but remain prone to unmeasured confounding. The classical E-value offers a simple way to quantify such bias but has been applied almost exclusively with respect to the statistical null. We reformulated the E-value framework to make explicit its applicability to predefined clinical margins, thereby extending its utility to non-inferiority analyses. Development: Using the bias-factor formulation by Ding and VanderWeele, we defined the non-inferiority E-value as the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need with both treatment and outcome, on the risk-ratio scale, to move the 95% confidence-limit estimate to the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Application: This approach was applied to three observational studies and one single-arm trial with external controls to illustrate interpretation and range. The resulting non-inferiority E-values for the confidence limits varied from about one to three, depending on design and findings. In the single-arm trial, a large gap between the confidence-limit and point-estimate NIEs reflected small sample size and wide confidence intervals, highlighting that both should be reported for a balanced assessment of robustness. Conclusion: This study reformulates the E-value to focus on clinically meaningful margins rather than the statistical null, enabling its application to non-inferiority analyses. Although the non-inferiority E-value inherits the limitations of the original method and cannot address all bias sources, it offers a transparent framework for interpreting non-randomised evidence and for generating insights that inform the design of future, more definitive randomised controlled trials.",

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is common, but it can be plagued by numerical issues in small data settings. The addition of a nugget helps but is not a cure-all. Penalized likelihood methods may improve upon traditional MLE, but their success depends on tuning parameter selection. We introduce a new cross-validation (CV) metric called ``decorrelated prediction error'' (DPE), within the penalized likelihood framework for GPs. Inspired by the Mahalanobis distance, DPE provides more consistent and reliable tuning parameter selection than traditional metrics like prediction error, particularly for $K$-fold CV. Our proposed metric performs comparably to standard MLE when penalization is unnecessary and outperforms traditional tuning parameter selection metrics in scenarios where regularization is beneficial, especially under the one-standard error rule.",

Building on Dirichlet regression, we introduce a split conformal approach based on quantile residuals and a highest-density region strategy that combines a fast coordinate-floor approximation with an internal grid refinement to restore sharpness. Both constructions are model-agnostic at the conformal layer and guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability, while respecting the geometry of the simplex. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study spanning homoscedastic and heteroscedastic designs shows that the quantile residual and grid-refined HDR methods achieve empirical coverage close to the nominal 90\\% level and produce substantially narrower regions than the coordinate-floor approximation, which tends to be conservative. We further demonstrate the methods on household budget shares from the BudgetItaly dataset, using standardized socioeconomic and price covariates with a train, calibration, and test split. In this application, the grid-refined HDR attains coverage closest to the target with the smallest average widths, closely followed by the quantile residual approach, while the simple triangular HDR yields wider, less informative sets. Overall, the results indicate that conformal prediction on the simplex can be both calibrated and efficient, providing practical uncertainty quantification for compositional prediction tasks.",

Temporal dynamics are incorporated through dynamic linear models within a fully Bayesian framework, ensuring coherent uncertainty propagation and efficient state-space inference. Additionally, we introduce a strategy for handling missing observations across different variables, preserving the joint data structure without discarding entire time points or stations. Through a simulation study and an application to real-world air quality monitoring data, we demonstrate that incorporating spatial deformation substantially improves interpolation accuracy in anisotropic scenarios while maintaining competitive performance under near-isotropy.

Asymptotic pointwise of the covariance are obtained for sparsified individual trajectories under some regularity conditions. Our proposed nonparametric method well perform the functional principal components analysis for the case of sparsified data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model.

From a network theoretic point of view, gossiping can be seen as a higher-order interaction, as it involves at least two persons talking about a non-present third. The mechanism of gossiping is complex: it is most likely dynamic, as its intensity changes over time, and possibly viral, if a gossiping event induces future gossiping, such as a repetition or retaliation. We define covariates of interest for these effects and propose a relational hyperevent model to study and quantify these complex dynamics. We consider survey data collected yearly from 44 secondary schools in Hungary. No information is available about the exact timing of the events nor about the aggregate number of events within the yearly time interval. What is measured is whether at least one gossiping event has occurred in a given time interval. We extend inference for relational hyperevent models to the case of rightcensored interval-time data and show how flexible and efficient generalized additive models can be used for estimation of effects of interest. Our analysis on the school data illustrates how a model that accounts for linear, smooth and random effects can identify the social drivers of gossiping, while revealing complex temporal dynamics.",

Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope).

Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \\textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \\iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\\textit{item-level}) and \\textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $\\mu \\in \\R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \\iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \\textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.",

    "abstract": "Scaling laws describe how learning performance improves with data, compute, or training time, and have become a central theme in modern deep learning. We study this phenomenon in a canonical nonlinear model: phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs whose covariance spectrum follows a power law. Unlike the isotropic case, where dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system, anisotropy yields a qualitatively new regime in which an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations governs the evolution of the summary statistics. We develop a tractable reduction that reveals a three-phase trajectory: (i) fast escape from low alignment, (ii) slow convergence of the summary statistics, and (iii) spectral-tail learning in low-variance directions. From this decomposition, we derive explicit scaling laws for the mean-squared error, showing how spectral decay dictates convergence times and error curves. Experiments confirm the predicted phases and exponents. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, highlighting how anisotropy reshapes learning dynamics.",

    "title": "Can discrete-time analyses be trusted for stepped wedge trials with continuous recruitment?",
    "abstract": "In stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs), interventions are sequentially rolled out to clusters over multiple periods. It is common practice to analyze SW-CRTs using discrete-time linear mixed models, in which measurements are considered to be taken at discrete time points. However, a recent systematic review found that 95.1\\% of cross-sectional SW-CRTs recruit individuals continuously over time. Despite the high prevalence of designs with continuous recruitment, there has been limited guidance on how to draw model-robust inference when analyzing such SW-CRTs. In this article, we investigate through simulations the implications of using discrete-time linear mixed models in the case of continuous recruitment designs with a continuous outcome. First, in the data-generating process, we characterize continuous recruitment with a continuous-time exponential decay correlation structure in the presence or absence of a continuous period effect, addressing scenarios both with and without a random or exposure-time-dependent intervention effect. Then, we analyze the simulated data under three popular discrete-time working correlation structures: simple exchangeable, nested exchangeable, and discrete-time exponential decay, with a robust sandwich variance estimator. Our results demonstrate that discrete-time analysis often yields minimum bias, and the robust variance estimator with the Mancl and DeRouen correction consistently achieves nominal coverage and type I error rate. One important exception occurs when recruitment patterns vary systematically between control and intervention periods, where discrete-time analysis leads to slightly biased estimates. Finally, we illustrate these findings by reanalyzing a concluded SW-CRT.",

    "abstract": "Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality. Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.",

    "abstract": "Many quantities characterizing infectious disease outbreaks - like the effective reproduction number ($R_t$), defined as the average number of secondary infections a newly infected individual will cause over the course of their infection - need to be modeled as time-varying parameters. It is common practice to use Gaussian random walks as priors for estimating such functions in Bayesian analyses of pathogen surveillance data. In this setting, however, the random walk prior may be too permissive, as it fails to capture prior scientific knowledge about the estimand and results in high posterior variance. We propose several Gaussian Markov process priors for $R_t$ inference, including the Integrated Brownian Motion (IBM), which can be represented as a Markov process when augmented with its corresponding Brownian Motion component, and is therefore computationally efficient and simple to implement and tune. We use simulated outbreak data to compare the performance of these proposed priors with the Gaussian random walk prior and another state-of-the-art Gaussian process prior based on an approximation to a Matérn covariance function. We find that IBM can match or exceed the performance of other priors, and we show that it produces epidemiologically reasonable and precise results when applied to county-level SARS-CoV-2 data.",

It is particularly significant in topological data analysis, which aims to make statistical inference from a topological perspective. In this work, we introduce a new topological summary for Bayesian neural networks, termed the predictive topological uncertainty (pTU). The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through various experiments, in terms of its statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness.",

Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded this http URL a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arXiv:2308.01853v2 ), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp. Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.",

While privacy and fairness have each been extensively studied, their joint treatment remains poorly understood. Existing research often frames them as conflicting objectives, with multiple studies suggesting that strong privacy notions such as differential privacy inevitably compromise fairness. In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm our theoretical results, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness/privacy trade-offs.",

Building on prior work on nonparametric comparison of regression curves, we extend the methodology to accommodate binary response data, which is typical in psychometric applications. The proposed approach includes a new estimator of the asymptotic variance of the test statistic and derives optimal weight functions that maximise local power. Because the asymptotic distribution of the resulting test statistic is unknown, a wild bootstrap procedure is applied for inference. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that the nonparametric approach effectively controls Type I error and achieves power comparable to the traditional logistic regression method, outperforming it in cases with multiple intersections of the underlying IRCs. The impact of bandwidth and weight specification is explored. Application to a verbal aggression dataset further illustrates the method's ability to detect subtle DIF patterns missed by parametric models. Overall, the proposed nonparametric framework provides a flexible and powerful alternative for detecting DIF, particularly in complex scenarios where traditional model-based assumptions may not be applicable.",

Here we use machine learning and simulation analyses to evaluate EEA in the context of California wildfire data from 2003-2020. We identify three major threats to validity: (1) individual event attribution estimates are highly sensitive to algorithmic design choices; (2) common performance metrics like area under the ROC curve or Brier score are not strongly correlated with attribution error, facilitating suboptimal model selection; and (3) distribution shift -- changes in temperature across climate scenarios -- substantially degrades predictive performance. To address these challenges, we propose a more valid and robust attribution analysis based on aggregate machine learning estimates, using an additional metric -- mean calibration error -- to assess model performance, and using subgroup and propensity diagnostics to assess distribution shift.",

To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.",

For example, waning vaccine protection influences booster dose recommendations, while cost-effectiveness analyses require accounting for long-term efficacy of treatments. However, there is no consensus on the methodology to assess and account for treatment effect waning. Even in randomized controlled trials, the common naïve comparison of hazard functions can lead to misleading causal conclusions due to inherent selection bias. Although comparing survival curves is sometimes recommended as a safer measure of causal effect, it only represents a cumulative effect over time and does not address treatment effect waning. We also explore recent formulations of causal hazard ratios, based on the principal stratification approach or the controlled direct effect. These causal hazard ratios cannot be identified without strong modeling assumptions, but bounds can be derived accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and one could try to use them to detect treatment effect waning. However, we illustrate that an increase in causal hazard ratios towards one does not necessarily mean that the protective effect of the treatment is fading. Furthermore, the same survival functions may correspond to both scenarios with and without waning, which shows that treatment effect waning cannot be identified from standard time-to-event data without strong untestable modeling assumptions.",

More broadly, feature engineering encompasses a wider set of practices aimed at enhancing predictive performance, and is typically performed as part of a data pre-processing step. In contrast, this paper integrates a substantial component of the feature engineering process directly into the modelling stage. This is achieved by introducing a novel general framework for embedding interpretable covariate transformations within multi-parameter Generalised Additive Models (GAMs). Our framework accommodates any sufficiently differentiable scalar-valued transformation of potentially high-dimensional and complex covariates. These transformations are treated as integral model components, with their parameters estimated jointly with regression coefficients via maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods, and joint uncertainty quantified via approximate Bayesian techniques. Smoothing parameters are selected in an empirical Bayes framework using a Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood, supported by efficient computation based on implicit differentiation methods. We demonstrate the flexibility and practical value of the proposed methodology through applications to forecasting electricity net-demand in Great Britain and to modelling house prices in London.

We introduce a novel framework for detecting core-periphery structures at the community level. Given a reference grouping of the nodes, the method optimizes an objective function that assigns core or peripheral roles to communities by accounting for the density and strength of their inter-community connections. The node-level partition may correspond to either inferred communities or to a node-attribute classification, such as discipline or location, enabling direct interpretation of how different social or organizational groups occupy central positions in the network.

    "abstract": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) model the timing of discrete events along a timeline and are widely used in fields such as neuroscience and fi- nance. Statistical depth functions are powerful tools for analyzing centrality and ranking in multivariate and functional data, yet existing depth notions for TPPs remain limited. In this paper, we propose a novel product depth specifically designed for TPPs observed only up to the first k events. Our depth function comprises two key components: a normalized marginal depth, which captures the temporal distribution of the final event, and a conditional depth, which characterizes the joint distribution of the preceding events. We establish its key theoretical properties and demonstrate its practical utility through simulation studies and real data applications.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.",

However, simultaneously characterizing power spectra for multiple time series remains challenging due to extra spectral variability and varying time series lengths. We propose a method for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of stationary time series (HBEST) that provides an interpretable framework for efficiently modeling multiple power spectra. HBEST models log power spectra using a truncated cosine basis expansion with a novel global-local coefficient decomposition, enabling simultaneous estimation of population-level and individual-level power spectra and accommodating time series of varying lengths. The fully Bayesian framework provides shrinkage priors for regularized estimation and efficient information sharing. Simulations demonstrate HBEST's advantages over competing methods in computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. An application to heart rate variability time series demonstrates HBEST's ability to accurately characterize power spectra and capture associations with traditional cardiovascular risk factors.",

However, recent disruptions, particularly post-COVID-19, raise questions about shift in these patterns. This study analyzes housing market date (1991-2024) to examine evolving seasonality and regional heterogeneity. Using Housing Price Index (HPI), inventory and sales data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, seasonal components are extracted via the X-13-ARIMA procedure, and statistical tests assess variations across regions. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in prices and volumes, with recent shifts toward earlier annual peak (March-April) and amplified seasonal effects. Regional variations align with differences in climate and market structure, while prices and sales volumes exhibit in-phase movement, suggesting thick-market momentum behaviour. These findings highlight key implications for policymakers, realtors and investors navigating post-pandemic market dynamics, offering insights into the timing and interpretation of housing market activities.",

    "abstract": "We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability. Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.",

We propose UniMoE-Guided, a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach that transfers expertise from multiple task-specific large models (teachers) into a single compact, deployable model (student). The student combines (i) a shared encoder for cross-task representations, (ii) a gated MoE block that balances shared and task-specific processing, and (iii) lightweight task heads. Trained with both ground-truth labels and teacher guidance, the student matches strong task-specific models while being far more efficient to train, store, and deploy. Beyond efficiency, the MoE layer improves transfer and generalization: experts develop reusable skills that boost cross-task performance and enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal additions and tuning. On nine NGSS-aligned science-reasoning tasks (seven for training/evaluation and two held out for adaptation), UniMoE-Guided attains performance comparable to per-task models while using $\\sim$6$\\times$ less storage than maintaining separate students, and $87\\times$ less than the 20B-parameter teacher. The method offers a practical path toward scalable, reliable, and resource-efficient automated scoring for classroom and large-scale assessment systems.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and genomic models are both used to predict breast cancer outcomes, but they are often combined using simple linear rules that do not account for how their risk scores relate, especially at the extremes. Using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, we studied whether directly modeling the joint relationship between clinical and genomic machine learning risk scores could improve risk stratification for 5-year cancer-specific mortality. We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set. These results show that copula-based fusion works in real-world cohorts and that considering dependencies between scores can better identify patient subgroups with the worst prognosis.",

    "abstract": "We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution. This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy. We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.",

We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips. This defines a natural discrete analogue of smoothed optimality generalizing the Gaussian case. Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor. Previously, such algorithms were known only with strong structural assumptions for the discrete hypercube, for example, independent coordinates or symmetric distributions. Our result provides the first computationally efficient guarantee for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces over the Boolean hypercube, bridging the gap between worst-case intractability and practical learnability in discrete settings.",

However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting.",

By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $\\alpha$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / \\alpha$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $\\epsilon > 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\epsilon$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $\\epsilon$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \\exp \\left( O\\left( \\tfrac{\\log^2 1 / \\alpha}{\\epsilon^2} \\right)\\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\\ell_2$ distance at most $\\epsilon$ to the true mean.

    "abstract": "Clustering algorithms have long been the topic of research, representing the more popular side of unsupervised learning. Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \\textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \\textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \\emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \\textit{k} means method. We also address some interesting possible research topics that reveal themselves as we answer the questions we initially set out to address.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic inference is increasingly critical for large language model (LLM) applications such as LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, multi-agent systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy. Code is available at this https URL .",

    "abstract": "Transformers can acquire Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities to solve complex reasoning tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction (CP) is a general framework to quantify the predictive uncertainty of machine learning models that uses a set prediction to include the true label with a valid probability. To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data. Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.",

This distinguishes our approach from most existing limit theorems in network econometrics, which are based on weak dependence concepts such as strong mixing, near-epoch dependence, and $\\psi$-dependence. By relaxing the assumption of an underlying metric space, our theorems can be applied to a broader range of network data, including financial and social networks. To derive the limit theorems, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (also known as physical dependence) from time series to random variables with network dependence. Using this framework, we establish several inequalities, a law of large numbers, and central limit theorems. Furthermore, we verify the conditions for these limit theorems based on primitive assumptions for spatial autoregressive models, which are widely used in network data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Many deployed learning systems must update models on streaming data under memory constraints. The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.",

The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.",

Although correlated noise, in particular via matrix factorizations, has been shown to improve accuracy, prior theoretical work focused primarily on the prefix-sum workload. That workload assumes a constant learning rate, whereas in practice learning rate schedules are widely used to accelerate training and improve convergence. We close this gap by deriving general upper and lower bounds for a broad class of learning rate schedules in both single- and multi-epoch settings. Building on these results, we propose a learning-rate-aware factorization that achieves improvements over prefix-sum factorizations under both MaxSE and MeanSE error metrics. Our theoretical analysis yields memory-efficient constructions suitable for practical deployment, and experiments on CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets confirm that schedule-aware factorizations improve accuracy in private training.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Linkage Clustering Beyond Binary Trees and Ultrametrics",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering seeks to uncover nested structures in data by constructing a tree of clusters, where deeper levels reveal finer-grained relationships. Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the linkage function under which this procedure exactly recovers the finest valid hierarchy, and we show that all linkage functions satisfying these conditions yield the same hierarchy after pruning. Notably, classical linkage rules such as single, complete, and average satisfy these conditions, whereas Ward's linkage fails to do so.",

    "abstract": "Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical to understanding complex scientific and engineering phenomena, yet traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive. Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method. Our method not only reduces average error but also the 99\\%, 95\\%, and 50\\% quantiles of error, which is rare for an AL algorithm. All in all, our approach offers a data-efficient solution to surrogate modeling for PDEs.",

    "abstract": "Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and class priors $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty.

Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping.

We formalize \\emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \\textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.",

    "abstract": "Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity, and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives. OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model development, evaluation, and comparison.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.",

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.",

Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL.",

Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.",

We provide explicit bounds on the $p$-variation norms and establish a Skorohod integral representation connecting our pathwise construction to the Malliavin calculus framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications to rough differential equations driven by MFBM, enabling the use of Lyons' universal limit theorem for this class of processes. Finally, we study the signature of MFBM paths, providing a complete algebraic characterization of their geometric properties. Our approach unifies the treatment of multiple fractional components and reveals the fundamental interactions between different regularity scales, completing the rough path foundation for mixed fractional processes with applications in stochastic analysis and beyond.",

However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network.",

We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval.",

This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.",

    "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",

    "abstract": "This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature. In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.",

We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.",

    "title": "Bayesian inference in high-dimensional models",
    "abstract": "Models with dimension more than the available sample size are now commonly used in various applications. A sensible inference is possible using a lower-dimensional structure. In regression problems with a large number of predictors, the model is often assumed to be sparse, with only a few predictors active. Interdependence between a large number of variables is succinctly described by a graphical model, where variables are represented by nodes on a graph and an edge between two nodes is used to indicate their conditional dependence given other variables. Many procedures for making inferences in the high-dimensional setting, typically using penalty functions to induce sparsity in the solution obtained by minimizing a loss function, were developed. Bayesian methods have been proposed for such problems more recently, where the prior takes care of the sparsity structure. These methods have the natural ability to also automatically quantify the uncertainty of the inference through the posterior distribution. Theoretical studies of Bayesian procedures in high-dimension have been carried out recently. Questions that arise are, whether the posterior distribution contracts near the true value of the parameter at the minimax optimal rate, whether the correct lower-dimensional structure is discovered with high posterior probability, and whether a credible region has adequate frequentist coverage. In this paper, we review these properties of Bayesian and related methods for several high-dimensional models such as many normal means problem, linear regression, generalized linear models, Gaussian and non-Gaussian graphical models. Effective computational approaches are also discussed.",

We characterize three different classes of summaries and demonstrate their importance for correctly analyzing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We demonstrate that minimizing the expected posterior entropy (EPE) under the prior predictive distribution of the model provides a unifying principle that subsumes many existing methods; they are shown to be equivalent to, or special or limiting cases of, minimizing the EPE. We offer a unifying framework for obtaining informative summaries and propose a practical method using conditional density estimation to learn high-fidelity summaries automatically. We evaluate this approach on diverse problems, including a challenging benchmark model with a multi-modal posterior, a population genetics model, and a dynamic network model of growing trees. The results show that EPE-minimizing summaries can lead to posterior inference that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, dedicated likelihood-based approaches, providing a powerful and general tool for practitioners.",

In $\\mathsf{CAT}$, one first trains a classifier by feeding it labeled synthetic samples generated by the null and alternative distributions, which is then used to predict labels of the actual data samples. This method is widely used in practice when the null and alternative are only specified via simulators (as in many scientific experiments). We study goodness-of-fit, two-sample ($\\mathsf{TS}$) and likelihood-free hypothesis testing ($\\mathsf{LFHT}$), and show that $\\mathsf{CAT}$ achieves (near-)minimax optimal sample complexity in both the dependence on the total-variation ($\\mathsf{TV}$) separation $\\epsilon$ and the probability of error $\\delta$ in a variety of non-parametric settings, including discrete distributions, $d$-dimensional distributions with a smooth density, and the Gaussian sequence model. In particular, we close the high probability sample complexity of $\\mathsf{LFHT}$ for each class. As another highlight, we recover the minimax optimal complexity of $\\mathsf{TS}$ over discrete distributions, which was recently established by Diakonikolas et al. (2021). The corresponding $\\mathsf{CAT}$ simply compares empirical frequencies in the first half of the data, and rejects the null when the classification accuracy on the second half is better than random.",

Our analysis shows that the SGD iterates and their invariant limit distribution \\emph{inherit} sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential concentration properties when these hold true for the gradient.

    "abstract": "High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Matérn covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.",

We show that, under any form of interference, the H-T estimator is inadmissible with respect to mean squared error for designs that generate a random number of units for a given treatment-exposure combination, which includes completely randomized and Bernoulli designs. In contrast, the Hajek and Ratio estimators are admissible under such designs as long as their weights exceed one. We show that the H-T estimator becomes admissible under restricted randomization schemes that fix treatment-exposure counts. These findings motivate a new estimator, the conditional horvitz-Thompson (CHT) estimator, which uses propensity scores conditional on the realized number of units in each treatment-exposure combination. We prove that the CHT estimator is unbiased and admissible for network causal effects, for any design, within the class of linear estimators. Because computing conditional propensity scores can be challenging in practice, we develop three practical approximations: an MCMC approximation and two closed-form approximations based on the difference-in-means and Ratio estimators, the first one avoids computing any propensity scores.

    "abstract": "Algorithm evaluation and comparison are fundamental questions in machine learning and statistics -- how well does an algorithm perform at a given modeling task, and which algorithm performs best? Many methods have been developed to assess algorithm performance, often based around cross-validation type strategies, retraining the algorithm of interest on different subsets of the data and assessing its performance on the held-out data points. Despite the broad use of such procedures, the theoretical properties of these methods are not yet fully understood. In this work, we explore some fundamental limits for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. In particular, we make a distinction between two questions: how good is an algorithm A at the problem of learning from a training set of size n, versus, how good is a particular fitted model produced by running A on a particular training data set of size $n$? Our main results prove that, for any test that treats the algorithm A as a ``black box'' (i.e., we can only study the behavior of A empirically), there is a fundamental limit on our ability to carry out inference on the performance of A, unless the number of available data points $N$ is many times larger than the evaluation sample size $n$ of interest. On the other hand, evaluating the performance of a particular fitted model can be easy when evaluating an algorithm is hard. We also ask whether an assumption of algorithmic stability might be sufficient to circumvent this hardness result. Surprisingly, we find that the same hardness result still holds for the problem of evaluating the performance of A, aside from a high-stability regime where fitted models are essentially nonrandom. Finally, we also establish similar hardness results for the problem of comparing multiple algorithms.",

In particular, the analytical expressions of the asymptotic behavior of the weighted sample trace moments of generalized inverse matrices are deduced in terms of the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can be easily computed in practice. The existent results for pseudo-inverses are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings provide universal methodology for construction of fully data-driven improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, optimal portfolio weights and beyond. It is found that the Moore-Penrose inverse acts asymptotically as a certain regularizer of the true covariance matrix and it seems that its proper transformation (shrinkage) performs similarly to or even outperforms the existing benchmarks in many applications, while keeping the computational time as minimal as possible.",

Factor analytic decompositions express the covariance as a sum of a low rank and diagonal matrix.

In this article, we exploit a blessing of dimensionality to develop a provably accurate pseudo-posterior for the covariance matrix that bypasses the need for Gibbs or other variants of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Our proposed Factor Analysis with BLEssing of dimensionality (FABLE) approach relies on a first-stage singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the latent factors, and then defines a jointly conjugate prior for the loadings and residual variances. The accuracy of the resulting pseudo-posterior for the covariance improves with increasing dimensionality. We show that FABLE has excellent performance in high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation, including producing well calibrated credible intervals, both theoretically and through simulation experiments. We also demonstrate the strength of our approach in terms of accurate inference and computational efficiency by applying it to a gene expression data set.",

However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \\emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \\emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.",

The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real data show that our robust estimators are competitive with state-of-the-art estimators.",

However, recent research has shown that this assumption can lead to severely misleading results if treatment effects vary with exposure time, i.e. time since the intervention started. Models that account for time-varying treatment effects, such as the exposure time indicator (ETI) model, allow researchers to target estimands such as the time-averaged treatment effect (TATE) over an interval of exposure time, or the point treatment effect (PTE) representing a treatment contrast at one time point. However, this increased flexibility results in reduced power. In this paper, we use public power calculation software and simulation to characterize factors affecting SW-CRT power. Key elements include choice of estimand, study design considerations, and analysis model selection. or common SW-CRT designs, the sample size (clusters per sequence or individuals per cluster-period) must be increased substantially, commonly by a factor of 1.5 to 3, but often by much more, to maintain 90\\% power when switching from an IT model to an ETI model (targeting the TATE over the study). However, the inflation factor is lower for TATE estimands over shorter periods that exclude longer exposure times. In general, SW-CRT designs (including the \"staircase\" variant) have much greater power for estimating \"short-term effects\" relative to \"long-term effects\". For an ETI model targeting a TATE estimand, substantial power can be gained by adding time points to the start of the study or increasing baseline sample size, but surprisingly little power is gained from adding time points to the end of the study.

Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Extrapolating treatment effects from related studies is a promising strategy for designing and analyzing clinical trials in situations where achieving an adequate sample size is challenging. Bayesian methods are well-suited for this purpose, as they enable the synthesis of prior information through the use of prior distributions. While the operating characteristics of Bayesian approaches for borrowing data from control arms have been extensively studied, methods that borrow treatment effects -- quantities derived from the comparison between two arms -- remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the findings of an extensive simulation study designed to address this gap. We evaluate the frequentist operating characteristics of these methods, including the probability of success, mean squared error, bias, precision, and credible interval coverage. Our results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of existing methods in the context of confirmatory trials. In particular, we show that the Conditional Power Prior and the Robust Mixture Prior perform better overall, while the test-then-pool variants and the p-value-based power prior display suboptimal performance.",

    "abstract": "Modern data often arises with multiple modalities. For example, covariates and a network are observed on the same subjects, and both contain useful information. Effectively integrating these modalities is important and challenging, especially when the response is unavailable. We study the fundamental covariate selection problem for high-dimensional data by leveraging network information. We propose the Network-Guided Covariate Selection (NGCS) algorithm. NGCS exploits the spectral structure of the network to construct a network-guided screening statistic, and employs data-driven Higher Criticism Thresholding for covariate recovery. We establish consistency guarantees for NGCS under general networks. In particular, under two commonly used network models, we relate the projected signal strength to the individual signal strength, and demonstrate that NGCS is optimal for covariate selection. It could achieve the same rate as supervised learning. We further consider a two-study setting for downstream applications, where the network is observed only in Study 1. For clustering and regression, we propose NG-clu and NG-reg algorithms. NG-clu accurately clusters all subjects, while NG-reg improves prediction by using the post-selection covariate matrix. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of our algorithms across various network models, noise distributions, and signal strengths.",

Despite its popularity and relevance, the theoretical properties of the softmax-contaminated MoE have remained unexplored in the literature. In the paper, we study the convergence rates of the maximum likelihood estimator of gating and prompt parameters in order to gain insights into the statistical properties and potential challenges of fine-tuning with a new prompt. We find that the estimability of these parameters is compromised when the prompt acquires overlapping knowledge with the pre-trained model, in the sense that we make precise by formulating a novel analytic notion of distinguishability. Under distinguishability of the pre-trained and prompt models, we derive minimax optimal estimation rates for all the gating and prompt parameters. By contrast, when the distinguishability condition is violated, these estimation rates become significantly slower due to their dependence on the prompt convergence rate to the pre-trained model.

    "abstract": "Structured data in the form of networks are increasingly common in a number of fields, including the social sciences, biology, physics, computer science, and many others. A key task in network analysis is community detection, which typically consists of dividing the nodes into groups such that nodes within a group are strongly connected, while connections between groups are relatively scarce. A generative model well suited for the formation of such communities is the assortative stochastic block model (SBM), which prescribes a higher probability of a connection between nodes belonging to the same block rather than to different blocks. A recent line of work has utilized Bayesian nonparametric methods to recover communities in the SBM by placing a prior distribution on the number of blocks and estimating block assignments via collapsed Gibbs samplers. However, efficiently incorporating the assortativity constraint through the prior remains an open problem. In this work, we address this gap by studying the effect of enforcing assortativity on Bayesian community detection and identifying the scenarios in which it pays dividends in comparison with standard SBM. We illustrate our findings through an extensive simulation study.",

The unit count is small, heterogeneity is large, and the optimal Supergeo partitioning problem is NP-hard. We introduce Optimized Supergeo Design (OSD), a two-stage framework that renders Supergeo designs practical for large-scale markets. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) first reduces the covariate space to create interpretable geo-embeddings. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver then selects a partition that balances both baseline outcomes and pre-treatment covariates. We provide theoretical arguments that OSD's objective value is within (1+{\\epsilon}) of the global optimum under community-structure assumptions. Rigorous ablation analysis demonstrates that PCA-based clustering achieves statistical parity with unit-level randomization (7% higher RMSE, not statistically significant) while enabling operational benefits through coarser granularity. Crucially, OSD solves the scalability bottleneck: for N=210 markets, OSD completes in 0.22 seconds compared to weeks for exact methods -- a speedup of over 5 million times. In extensive simulations with up to 1,000 units, OSD achieves excellent covariate balance (SMD < 1%) and retains every media dollar, establishing a scalable framework that matches the statistical efficiency of randomization with the operational practicality of Supergeos.",

We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, we consider $N$ independent stochastic processes, each driven by a linear combination of standard Brownian motion and an independent fractional Brownian motion, and governed by a drift term that depends on an unobserved random effect with unknown distribution. Based on discrete-time statistics of process increments, we construct parametric estimators for the Brownian motion volatility, the scaling parameter for the fractional Brownian motion, and the Hurst parameter using a generalized method of moments. We establish strong consistency and joint asymptotic normality of these estimators. Then, from one trajectory, we consistently estimate the random effects, using a plug-in approach, and we study their asymptotic behavior under different asymptotic regimes as $N$ and $n$ grow. Finally, we construct a nonparametric estimator for the distribution function of these random effects using a Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev-Gauss nodes based method, and we analyze its asymptotic properties as both the number of subjects $N$ and the number of observations per-subject $n$ increase. A numerical simulation framework is also investigated to illustrate the theoretical results of the estimators behavior.",

Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam.

This construction avoids direct estimation of conditional mean embeddings and reduces the problem to scalar-valued regressions, resulting in robust finite-sample size control. Theoretically, we derive the limiting distribution of the SGCM statistic, establish the validity of a wild bootstrap for inference, and obtain uniform asymptotic size control under doubly robust conditions. As an additional contribution, we show that exponential kernels induced by continuous semimetrics of negative type are characteristic on general Polish spaces -- with extensions to finite tensor products -- thereby providing a foundation for applying our test and other kernel methods to complex objects such as distribution-valued data and curves on metric spaces. Extensive simulations indicate that the SGCM-based CI test attains near-nominal size and exhibits power competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art alternatives across a range of challenging scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive (top-down) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative (bottom-up) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a linkage method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment with 40 different products as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process. We show formally that confoundness stems from ambiguous prompting strategies. Therefore, it can be addressed by developing unambiguous prompting strategies through unblinding, i.e., revealing the experiment design in LLM simulations. Our empirical results show that this strategy consistently enhances model performance across all tested models, including both out-of-box reasoning and non-reasoning models. We also show that it is a technique that complements fine-tuning: while fine-tuning can improve simulation performance, an unambiguous prompting strategy makes the predictions robust to the inclusion of irrelevant data in the fine-tuning process.",

The dominant current approach to the quantitative evaluation of mechanisms relies on the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) with respect to pre-treatment covariates. This paper develops a framework to understand when the existence of such heterogeneous treatment effects can support inferences about the activation of a mechanism. We show first that this design cannot provide evidence of mechanism activation without additional, generally implicit, exclusion assumptions. Further, even when these assumptions are satisfied, the presence of HTEs supports the inference that mechanism is active but the absence of HTEs is generally uninformative about mechanism activation.

This paper presents a novel unlearning framework that enables fully parallel unlearning among models exhibiting inheritance. We use a chronologically Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture various unlearning scenarios occurring in model inheritance networks. Central to our framework is the Fisher Inheritance Unlearning (FIUn) method, designed to enable efficient parallel unlearning within the DAG. FIUn utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to assess the significance of model parameters for unlearning tasks and adjusts them accordingly. To handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, we propose the Merging-FIM (MFIM) function, which consolidates FIMs from multiple upstream models into a unified matrix. This design supports all unlearning scenarios captured by the DAG, enabling one-shot removal of inherited knowledge while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our unlearning framework. For single-class tasks, it achieves complete unlearning with 0% accuracy for unlearned labels while maintaining 94.53% accuracy for retained labels. For multi-class tasks, the accuracy is 1.07% for unlearned labels and 84.77% for retained labels. Our framework accelerates unlearning by 99% compared to alternative methods.

Our analysis captures both statistical heterogeneity (including covariate and concept shifts) and variation in local dataset sizes, aspects often overlooked in prior work. We further extend these results to nonlinear models including logistic regression and one-hidden-layer ReLU networks. Specifically, we design a spectral estimator that leverages independent replicas of local averages to approximate the non-convex least-squares solution and derive a nearly matching minimax lower bound. Our estimator achieves the optimal statistical rate when the shared representation is well covered across clients -- i.e., when no direction is severely underrepresented. Our results reveal two distinct phases of the optimal rate: a standard parameter-counting regime and a penalized regime when the number of clients is large or local datasets are small.

In this paper, we present the first theoretical analysis of FT methods for machine unlearning within a linear regression framework, providing a deeper exploration of this phenomenon. Our analysis reveals that while FT models can achieve zero remaining loss, they fail to forget the forgetting data, as the pretrained model retains its influence and the fine-tuning process does not adequately mitigate it. To address this, we propose a novel Retention-Based Masking (RBM) strategy that constructs a weight saliency map based on the remaining dataset, unlike existing methods that focus on the forgetting dataset. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RBM not only significantly improves unlearning accuracy (UA) but also ensures higher retaining accuracy (RA) by preserving overlapping features shared between the forgetting and remaining datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, showing that RBM outperforms existing masking approaches in balancing UA, RA, and disparity metrics.",

    "abstract": "Training data attribution (TDA) is concerned with understanding model behavior in terms of the training data. This paper draws attention to the common setting where one has access only to the final trained model, and not the training algorithm or intermediate information from training. We reframe the problem in this \"final-model-only\" setting as one of measuring sensitivity of the model to training instances. To operationalize this reframing, we propose further training, with appropriate adjustment and averaging, as a gold standard method to measure sensitivity. We then unify existing gradient-based methods for TDA by showing that they all approximate the further training gold standard in different ways. We investigate empirically the quality of these gradient-based approximations to further training, for tabular, image, and text datasets and models. We find that the approximation quality of first-order methods is sometimes high but decays with the amount of further training. In contrast, the approximations given by influence function methods are more stable but surprisingly lower in quality.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.",

    "abstract": "Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence. Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and conformal.",

Compared to other problems from the vehicle routing family, the interrelations between inventory and routing decisions render IRP optimization more challenging and call for advanced solution techniques. A few studies have focused on developing large neighborhood search approaches for this class of problems, but this remains a research area with vast possibilities due to the challenges related to the integration of inventory and routing decisions. In this study, we advance this research area by developing a new large neighborhood search operator tailored for the IRP. Specifically, the operator optimally removes and reinserts all visits to a specific retailer while minimizing routing and inventory costs. We propose an efficient tailored dynamic programming algorithm that exploits preprocessing and acceleration strategies. The operator is used to build an effective local search routine, and included in a state-of-the-art routing algorithm, i.e., Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS).

In these complex domains, exact posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable, motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI). However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from slow convergence and numerical instability. We propose SDE Inference via Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We provide theoretical guarantees that SING approximately optimizes the intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets, including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.",

Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than its model-based counterparts.

We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classification tasks, quantifying how input perturbations affect outputs. Our main result shows that wide LIF-SNN classifiers are stable on average, a property explained by the concentration of their Fourier spectrum on low-frequency components. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of spectral simplicity, which formalizes simplicity in terms of Fourier spectrum concentration and connects our analysis to the simplicity bias observed in deep networks. Within this framework, we show that random LIF-SNNs are biased toward simple functions. Experiments on trained networks confirm that these stability properties persist in practice.

A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%).",

Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced.

To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios.",

We observe that encoder-decoder ASR models (e.g., Whisper) surface word-level mismatches between speech and text via cross-attention, providing a fine-grained reward signal. Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR). Without explicit reward annotations, W3AR uses attention from a pre-trained ASR model to drive finer-grained alignment and optimization of sequences predicted by a TTS model. Experiments show that W3AR improves the quality of existing TTS systems and strengthens zero-shot robustness on unseen speakers.

However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches. Validation across contrasting sites: topographically complex Nikko, Japan, and flat Landes, France, demonstrates 15-16% improvements over original GEDI positions and 0.5-2% improvements over the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm. L-BFGS-B with Area-based metrics achieves optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, while population-based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) excel in complex terrain. The platform-agnostic framework facilitates straightforward adaptation to emerging spaceborne LiDAR missions, providing a generalizable foundation for universal geolocation correction essential for reliable global forest monitoring and climate policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "CMOS-compatible single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have emerged in many systems as the solution of choice for cameras with photon-number resolution and photon counting capabilities. Being natively digital optical interfaces, SPADs are naturally drawn to in situ logic processing and event-driven computation; they are usually coupled to discrete FPGAs to enable reconfigurability. In this work, we propose to bring the FPGA on-chip, in direct contact with the SPADs at pixel or cluster level. To demonstrate the suitability of this approach, we created an architecture for processing timestamps and photon counts using programmable weighted sums based on an efficient use of look-up tables. The outputs are processed hierarchically, similarly to what is done in FPGAs, reducing power consumption and simplifying I/Os. Finally, we show how artificial neural networks can be designed and reprogrammed by using look-up tables in an efficient way.",

    "abstract": "Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a unified image reconstruction framework that bridges real-time and gated cardiac MRI, including quantitative MRI. Methods: We introduce Generative Multitasking, which learns an implicit neural temporal basis from sequence timings and an interpretable latent space for cardiac and respiratory motion. Cardiac motion is modeled as a complex harmonic, with phase encoding timing and a latent amplitude capturing beat-to-beat functional variability, linking cardiac phase-resolved (\"gated-like\") and time-resolved (\"real-time-like\") views. We implemented the framework using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and evaluated it for free-breathing, non-ECG-gated radial GRE in three settings: steady-state cine imaging, multicontrast T2prep/IR imaging, and dual-flip-angle T1/T2 mapping, compared with conventional Multitasking. Results: Generative Multitasking provided flexible cardiac motion representation, enabling reconstruction of archetypal cardiac phase-resolved cines (like gating) as well as time-resolved series that reveal beat-to-beat variability (like real-time imaging). Conditioning on the previous k-space angle and modifying this term at inference removed eddy-current artifacts without globally smoothing high temporal frequencies. For quantitative mapping, Generative Multitasking reduced intraseptal T1 and T2 coefficients of variation compared with conventional Multitasking (T1: 0.13 vs. 0.31; T2: 0.12 vs. 0.32; p<0.001), indicating higher SNR. Conclusion: Generative Multitasking uses a CVAE with complex harmonic cardiac coordinates to unify gated and real-time CMR within a single free-breathing, non-ECG-gated acquisition. It allows flexible cardiac motion representation, suppresses trajectory-dependent artifacts, and improves T1 and T2 mapping, suggesting a path toward cine, multicontrast, and quantitative imaging without separate gated and real-time scans.",

    "abstract": "Lensless imaging enables exceptionally compact fluorescence sensors, advancing applications in \\textit{in vivo} imaging and low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics. These sensors require a filter to block the excitation light while passing fluorescent emissions. However, conventional thin-film interference filters are sensitive to angle of incidence (AOI), complicating their use in lensless systems. Here we thoroughly analyze and optimize a technique using a fiber optic plate (FOP) to absorb off-axis light that would bleed through the interference filter while improving image resolution. Through simulations, we show that the numerical aperture (NA) of the FOP drives inherent design tradeoffs: collection efficiency improves rapidly with a higher NA, but at the cost of resolution, increased device thickness, and fluorescence excitation efficiency. To illustrate this, we optimize two optical frontends with full-width at half maximums (FWHMs) of 8.3° and 45.7°. Implementing these designs, we show that angle-insensitivity requires filters on both sides of the FOP, due to scattering. In imaging experiments, the 520-$\\mu$m-thick high-NA design is 59$\\times$ more sensitive to fluorescence while only degrading resolution by 3.2$\\times$. Alternatively, the low-NA design is capable of three-color fluorescence imaging with 110-$\\mu$m resolution at a 1-mm working distance. Overall, we demonstrate a versatile optical frontend that is adaptable to a range of applications using different fluorophores, illumination configurations, and lensless imaging techniques.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.",

    "abstract": "Discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), such as the DCT-2 and the DST-7, are widely used in video codecs for their balance between coding performance and computational efficiency. In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are widely employed for medical image segmentation, but they are still challenged by their intrinsic characteristics. CNNs are limited from capturing varying-scaled features and global contextual information due to the employment of fixed-sized kernels. In contrast, ViTs employ self-attention and MLP for global information modeling, but they lack mechanisms to learn spatial-wise local information. Additionally, self-attention leads the network to show high computational complexity. To tackle these limitations, we propose Progressively Entangled Transformer Large Kernel (PTLK) and Collaboratively Entangled Transformer Large Kernel (CTLK) modules to leverage the benefits of self-attention and large kernel convolutions and overcome shortcomings. Specifically, PTLK and CTLK modules employ the Multi-head Large Kernel to capture multi-scale local features and the Efficient Decomposed Self-attention to model global information efficiently. Subsequently, they employ the Attention Entanglement mechanism to enable local and global features to enhance and calibrate each other progressively and collaboratively. Additionally, an Attention-gated Channel MLP (AG-MLP) module is proposed to equip the standard MLP module with the capabilities of modeling spatial information. PTLK and CTLK modules are further incorporated as a Cross Entanglement Decoding (CED) block for efficient feature fusion and decoding. Finally, we propose a novel network for volumetric medical image segmentation that employs an encoder-decoder architecture, termed TransLK-Net. The encoder employs a hierarchical ViT architecture whose block is built by incorporating PTLK and CTLK with AG-MLP into a ViT block, and the decoder employs the CED block.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit.",

Data-driven methods are widely used, but they often overlook physical principles, leading to unrealistic spectra, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands. To address this challenge, we propose the Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SSRNO), which incorporates atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) prior into the data-driven procedure, yielding more physically consistent predictions. The proposed SSRNO framework consists of three stages: upsampling, reconstruction, and refinement. In the upsampling stage, we leverage prior information to expand the input multispectral image, producing a physically plausible hyperspectral estimate. Subsequently, we utilize a neural operator in the reconstruction stage to learn a continuous mapping across the spectral domain. Finally, the refinement stage imposes a hard constraint on the output HSI to eliminate color distortion. The upsampling and refinement stages are implemented via the proposed guidance matrix projection (GMP) method, and the reconstruction neural operator adopts U-shaped spectral-aware convolution (SAC) layers to capture multi-scale features. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate the optimality of the GMP method. With the neural operator and ART priors, SSRNO also achieves continuous spectral reconstruction and zero-shot extrapolation.

A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas.",

Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity.",

The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a {\\pi} difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices.

    "abstract": "Event-based control, unlike analogue control, poses significant analytical challenges due to its hybrid dynamics. This work investigates the stability and inter-event time properties of a control-affine system under event-based impulsive control. The controller consists of multiple neuronal units with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics acting on a time-invariant, multiple-input multiple-output plant in closed loop. Both the plant state and the neuronal units exhibit discontinuities that cancel if combined linearly, enabling a direct correspondence between the event-based impulsive controller and a corresponding analogue controller. Leveraging this observation, we prove global practical stability of the event-based impulsive control system. In the general nonlinear case, we show that the event-based impulsive controller ensures global practical asymptotic stability if the analogue system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to specific disturbances. In the linear case, we further show global practical exponential stability if the analogue system is stable. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. The findings reveal a fundamental link between analogue and event-based impulsive control, providing new insights for the design of neuromorphic controllers.",

    "title": "Diverse Instance Generation via Diffusion Models for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images",
    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel instances with only a limited number of labeled training samples, presenting a challenge that is particularly prominent in numerous remote sensing applications such as endangered species monitoring and disaster assessment. Existing FSOD methods for remote sensing images (RSIs) have achieved promising progress but remain constrained by the limited diversity of instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that can leverage a diffusion model pretrained on large-scale natural images to synthesize diverse remote sensing instances, thereby improving the performance of few-shot object detectors. Instead of directly synthesizing complete remote sensing images, we first generate instance-level slices via a specialized slice-to-slice module, and then embed these slices into full-scale imagery for enhanced data augmentation. To further adapt diffusion models for remote sensing scenarios, we develop a class-agnostic image inversion module that can invert remote sensing instance slices into semantic space. Additionally, we introduce contrastive loss to semantically align the synthesized images with their corresponding classes. Experimental results show that our method hasachieved an average performance improvement of 4.4% across multiple datasets and various approaches. Ablation experiments indicate that the elaborately designed inversion module can effectively enhance the performance of FSOD methods, and the semantic contrastive loss can further boost the performance.",

    "abstract": "Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).",

    "abstract": "The Broad Learning System (BLS) has gained significant attention for its computational efficiency and less network parameters compared to deep learning structures. However, the standard BLS relies on the pseudoinverse solution, which minimizes the mean square error with $L_2$-norm but lacks robustness against sensor noise and outliers common in industrial environments. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Broad Learning System (S-BLS) framework. Instead of the traditional ridge regression, we incorporate the Sequential Threshold Least-Squares (STLS) algorithm -- originally utilized in the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) -- into the output weight learning process of BLS. By iteratively thresholding small coefficients, the proposed method promotes sparsity in the output weights, effectively filtering out noise components while maintaining modeling accuracy. This approach falls under the category of sparse regression and is particularly suitable for noisy environments. Experimental results on a numerical nonlinear system and a noisy Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and achieves superior robustness compared to standard BLS.",

    "abstract": "Real-time traffic crash detection is critical in intelligent transportation systems because traditional crash notifications often suffer delays and lack specific, lane-level location information, which can lead to safety risks and economic losses. This paper proposes a real-time, lane-level crash detection approach for freeways that only leverages sparse telematics trajectory data. In the offline stage, the historical trajectories are discretized into spatial cells using vector cross-product techniques, and then used to estimate a vehicle intention distribution and select an alert threshold by maximizing the F1-score based on official crash reports. In the online stage, incoming telematics records are mapped to these cells and scored for three modules: transition anomalies, speed deviations, and lateral maneuver risks, with scores accumulated into a cell-specific risk map. When any cell's risk exceeds the alert threshold, the system issues a prompt warning. Relying solely on telematics data, this real-time and low-cost solution is evaluated on a Wisconsin dataset and validated against official crash reports, achieving a 75% crash identification rate with accurate lane-level localization, an overall accuracy of 96%, an F1-score of 0.84, and a non-crash-to-crash misclassification rate of only 0.6%, while also detecting 13% of crashes more than 3 minutes before the recorded crash time.",

    "abstract": "Accurate mass estimation is essential for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous heavy-duty vehicles, particularly during transportation missions in unstructured environments such as mining sites, where vehicle mass can vary significantly due to loading and unloading. While prior work has recognized the importance of acceleration profiles for estimation accuracy, the systematic design of driving profiles during transport has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents a framework for designing driving profiles to support accurate mass estimation. Based on application-oriented input design, it aims to meet a user-defined accuracy constraint under three optimization objectives: minimum-time, minimum-distance, and maximum accuracy (within a fixed time). It allows time- and distance-dependent bounds on acceleration and velocity, and is based on a Newtonian vehicle dynamics model with actuator dynamics. The optimal profiles are obtained by solving concave optimization problems using a branch-and-bound method, with alternative rank-constrained and semi-definite relaxations also discussed. Theoretical analysis provides insights into the optimal profiles, including feasibility conditions, key ratios between velocity and acceleration bounds, and trade-offs between time- and distance-optimal solutions. The framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on a Scania truck with different payloads. Results show that the designed profiles are feasible and effective, enabling accurate mass estimation as part of normal transportation operations without requiring dedicated calibration runs. An additional contribution is a non-causal Wiener filter, with parameters estimated via the Empirical Bayes method, used to filter the accelerometer signal with no phase-lag.",

    "abstract": "Modular Multilevel Converter-based High Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) system is a promising technology for integration of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, onshore AC faults on MMC-HVDC reduce the power transfer capability of onshore converter station, leading to surplus power accumulation in HVDC link. This surplus power causes a rapid rise in DC-link voltage and may hinder safe operation of OWFs. To address such a situation, this paper presents an AC fault ride-through scheme that combines the storage of surplus power in MMC submodule (SM) capacitors and dissipation of residual power in an energy dissipation device (EDD). The proposed energy control facilitates use of half-bridge MMC SMs with low-capacitance, with their storage capacity leveraged to share the surplus power during faults, with a lower-rated EDD. The proposed scheme is tested on a 640kV/420MW MMC-HVDC system. The results show that proposed control scheme effectively maintains DC link voltages, ensuring connection of OWFs.",

Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements, a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC.",

The proposed algorithm employs truncated statistics to separate target and noise components in the radar echo power spectrum, thereby restoring the homogeneity assumption of the reference window. In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples. Compared with various CFAR algorithms, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of the reference window, accurately estimates the noise spectrum, and exhibits superior detection performance and computational efficiency in complex scenarios affected by sidelobe contamination.",

Nevertheless, existing studies are largely confined to single-antenna systems, failing to offer dedicated guidance for multi-antenna communication scenarios. To address the inherent conflict between traditional real-value pathloss map and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) coherent beamforming in B5G/6G systems, this paper proposes a novel concept of BeamCKM and CKMTransUNet architecture. The CKMTransUNet approach combines a UNet backbone for multi-scale feature extraction with a vision transformer (ViT) module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors, utilizing a composite loss function to characterize the beam propagation characteristics. Furthermore, based on the CKMTransUNet backbone, this paper presents a methodology named M3ChanNet. It leverages the multi-modal learning technique and cross-attention mechanisms to extract intrinsic side information from environmental profiles and real-time multi-beam observations, thereby further improving the map construction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) interpolation methods and deep learning (DL) approaches, delivering superior performance even when environmental contours are inaccurate.

    "abstract": "Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation. Audio samples are available at: this https URL",

SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.",

    "abstract": "Expired functional drinks have great valorisation potential due to the high concentration of organic molecules present. However, detailed information of the resources in these expired functional drinks is limited, hindering the rational design of a recovery system. To address this gap, we present here a study that comprehensively characterises the chemical composition of functional drinks and discus their potential use as feedstocks for biomethane production. The example functional drinks were abundant in sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, and were especially rich in glucose, fructose, and alanine. Our studies revealed that functional drinks with high COD values that corresponded to high proportions of sugar and organic acid and low proportions of sorbitol and amino acids could realise profitable recovery through anaerobic digestion, with a minimum biomethane yield of 11.72 mL CH4 / mL drink. To assess utility further we also examined the dynamic composition of functional drinks up to 16 weeks (at 4 °C) after expiration to capture the shift in resources during deterioration. In doing so, we identified 4 distinct periods of carbon resource variation: 1) chemically stable period, 2) sorbitol degradation period, 3) sugar degradation period, and 4) acidification period. Based on the time-course biomethane production experiments for expired functional drinks, the optimal operating time window for biomethane production from drinks without ascorbic acid would be after sorbitol degradation period in terms of its economic performance through convenient natural deterioration. Therefore, this comprehensive study on dynamic chemical composition in expired functional drinks and their biomethane production potential could facilitate a rational design of resource recovery system for soft drink field.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.",

Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.",

Leveraging pretrained LLMs, we propose a channel quality prediction method empowered by LLMs to optimize AMC, termed LLM4AMC. We freeze most parameters of the LLM and fine-tune it to fully utilize the knowledge acquired during pretraining while better adapting it to the AMC task. We design a network architecture composed of four modules, a preprocessing layer, an embedding layer, a backbone network, and an output layer, effectively capturing the time-varying characteristics of channel quality to achieve accurate predictions of future channel conditions.

    "abstract": "Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of 6G systems demands advanced technologies to boost network capacity and spectral efficiency, particularly in the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods.",

Conventional hard-magnetization with well-established three-phase voltages during transformer energization induces severe inrush currents due to flux offset, which can damage power semiconductor devices. To overcome this drawback, an ultra-fast soft-magnetization method is firstly introduced, leveraging the voltage programmability of the inverter to actively reshape the initial voltage profile and thereby eliminate flux offset of the transformer core. By suppressing the formation of flux offset itself, the proposed approach prevents magnetic saturation and achieves nominal terminal voltage within a few milliseconds while effectively suppressing inrush current. However, this method can still trigger surge currents to power semiconductor devices in the presence of an LC filter due to abrupt voltage magnitude and phase transitions. To address this issue, an enhanced Archimedean spiral soft-magnetization method is developed, where both voltage magnitude and phase evolve smoothly to simultaneously suppress inrush and surge currents. Furthermore, residual flux in the transformer core is considered, and a demagnetization sequence using the inverter is validated to ensure reliable start-up. Experimental results confirm that the proposed methods achieve rapid black-start performance within one fundamental cycle while ensuring safe and stable operation of GFM converters.",

The kinetic energy of such systems is commonly invariant to the induced action by the Lie group, and the system dynamics can be written as a coupled ordinary differential equation on the group and the dual space of its Lie algebra, termed a Lie-Poisson system. In this paper, we show that Lie-Poisson systems can also be written as a left-invariant system on a semi-direct Lie group structure placed on the trivialised cotangent bundle of the symmetry group. The authors do not know of a prior reference for this observation and we are confident the insight has never been exploited in the context of tracking control. We use this representation to build a right-invariant tracking error for the full state of a Lie-Poisson mechanical system and show that the error dynamics for this error are themselves of Lie-Poisson structure, albeit with time-varying inertia. This allows us to tackle the general trajectory tracking problem using an energy shaping design metholodology.

Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets.

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless communication and sensing performance towards sixth-generation (6G) networks through flexible antenna movement. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance.",

We propose an adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (A-PCS) coherent system utilizing enumerated spherical shaping (ESS) for distribution matching. With PCS-64QAM, the system achieves continuous rate control from conventional QPSK-equivalent to 64QAM spectral efficiency, providing quasi-continuous control with granularities of approximately $0.05$~bits/4D for spectral efficiency and $0.1$~dB for the post-FEC SNR threshold, and a maximum control depth of $12.5$~dB. Leveraging ESS for efficient sequence utilization, it offers higher spectral utilization and finer control granularity than constant composition DM (CCDM)-based A-PCS systems. We further model and analyze the FSO channel, presenting calculations and comparisons of outage probability and ergodic capacity under varying turbulence intensities and pointing errors. Results demonstrate 99.999~\\% reliability at maximum $\\sigma_\\mathrm{R}^2 = 1.39$ and $\\sigma_\\mathrm{s} = 0.5~\\mathrm{m}$, meeting requirements under severe turbulence and large pointing errors.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.",

The study employs data visualisation and complex statistics to examine critical data about power systems in Bangladesh. This includes load patterns on a daily, monthly, annual, weekend, and weekday basis. Significant alterations in these patterns have been observed during our study e.g., in April and May of 2020, the power demand decreased by approximately 15.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. We have used a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to predict the load profile of 2020 excluding COVID-19 effects. This model is compared with the actual load profile to determine the degree to which COVID-19 has impacted. The comparison indicates that the average power demand decreased by approximately 19.5% in April 2020 and 18.3% in May 2020, relative to its projected value. The study also investigates system stability by analyzing transmission loss and load factor, and the environmental effect by analyzing the Carbon Dioxide emission rate. Finally, the study provides recommendations for overcoming future disasters, such as developing more resilient power systems, investing in renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency.",

This mechanism has only one degree of freedom (DoF) and thus makes for efficient and reliable deployment without loss of structural integrity. It employed a systematic design approach starting from a triple scissors links modular unit to a 25m aperture assembly. Different configurations constituting variable numbers of modular units were analyzed in SolidWorks to identify the deployable mechanism with lowest deformation. While the 24 units configuration offered superior stowage compactness, it exhibited higher deformation (0.01437mm), confirming the 12 units configuration as the optimal balance between structural stability and deployment efficiency. Screw theory was employed to analyze the kinematic properties, and numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB and SolidWorks. The deployable space antenna showed transition from stowed to fully deployed state in just 53 seconds with high stability throughout the deployment process. The TSDAM attained a storage ratio of up to 15.3 for height and volume with 0.01048mm of deformation for a 12 units configuration. Mesh convergence analysis proved the consistency of the simulation results for 415314 tetrahedral shaped elements. The virtual experiments in SolidWorks verified the analytical Screw theory based model and ensured that the design was smooth and flexible for deployment in operational conditions. The research establishes a robust design framework for future deployable antennas, offering enhanced performance, simplified structure, and improved reliability",

    "abstract": "Flow measurement in partially filled pipes presents greater complexity compared to fully filled systems, primarily due to the complex velocity distribution within the cross-section, which is a key source of measurement inaccuracy. To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.",

We consider a scenario where a multi-antenna, dual-function base station (BS) performs secure beamforming for a multi-antenna legitimate receiver while simultaneously detecting potential targets. Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs.",

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) represent a novel approach that enables flexible adjustments to antenna positions, effectively altering the channel environment and thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs.",

Where previous data driven, set-based approaches to PI set synthesis used deterministic sampling schemes, this work instead synthesizes PI sets from any pre-collected data sets. Beyond a data set and Lipschitz continuity, no additional information about the system is needed. A tree data structure is used to partition the space and select samples used to construct the PI set, while Lipschitz continuity is used to provide deterministic guarantees of invariance.

As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.",

Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior.

    "abstract": "Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.",

Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs. Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics. Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms represent a key advancement in autonomous systems, enabling coordinated missions through inter-UAV communication. However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency. To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources. Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system. Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems.",

    "abstract": "The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.",

A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.",

While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \\( d_H(\\mathcal{E}_N,\\mathcal{E}_\\infty) \\le r_W\\,\\gamma^{N+1}/(1-\\gamma), \\) where $\\gamma<1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.",

In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) enable a number of magnetically guided surgical procedures. A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils. The results demonstrate that feedback is a practical path to scalable, efficient, and clinically relevant magnetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $\\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \\& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\\texttt{PAAD}$.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a coupled physical statistical framework for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested areas using dual frequency X and Ku band SAR observations. The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.",

While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication.

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples.

Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.",

    "abstract": "Low-carbon liquid fuels play a key role in energy system decarbonization scenarios. This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems.",

Our method discovers diverse motion patterns, ranging from trotting to galloping, robust standing policies, jumping, and handstand balancing, purely through the optimization of high-level objectives. Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities. In simulation, we further showcase more complex behaviors, such as backflips, dynamic handstand balancing and locomotion on a Humanoid, all without requiring reference tracking or offline pre-training.",

    "abstract": "Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.",

The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. We accordingly derive a necessary and sufficient graph condition for our algorithms to succeed; also, our tracking error bounds are smaller than that of the existing method. Furthermore, it is emphasized that even when agents do not use relays, our condition is tighter than the sufficient conditions in the literature. With multi-hop relays, we can further obtain more relaxed graph requirements. Finally, we present numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.",

We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled.

In our model, a dispatcher either admits every arrival into the system (when there is room) or blocks it. Every served job yields a fixed reward but incurs a per unit time holding cost which includes the waiting time in the queue to get service if there is any. We aim to design a dispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward by observing arrival times and system state at arrivals, a realistic decision-event driven sampling of such systems. The dispatcher observes neither service times nor departure epochs, which excludes the use of reward-based reinforcement learning approaches. We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning problem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalent control switches between always admit if room (explore infinitely often), and never admit (terminate learning), so at judiciously chosen times we avoid the never admit recommendation. We prove that our proposed policy asymptotically converges to the optimal policy and present finite-time regret guarantees. The extreme contrast in the control policies shows up in our regret bounds for different parameter regimes: constant in one versus logarithmic in another.",

However, it relies heavily on the expertise and clinical experience of the sonographer. In ultrasound images, a single nodule might present heterogeneous appearances in different cross-sectional views which makes it hard to perform per-nodule examination. Sonographers usually discriminate different nodules by examining the nodule features and the surrounding structures like gland and duct, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. To address this problem, we collected hundreds of breast ultrasound videos and built a nodule reidentification system that consists of two parts: an extractor based on the deep learning model that can extract feature vectors from the input video clips and a real-time clustering algorithm that automatically groups feature vectors by nodules. The system obtains satisfactory results and exhibits the capability to differentiate ultrasound videos. As far as we know, it's the first attempt to apply re-identification technique in the ultrasonic field.",

With a simple academic example, we show that existing moving horizon estimation (MHE) approaches for joint state and parameter estimation as well as classical adaptive observers can result in diverging state estimates in the absence of PE, even if the noise is small. We propose an MHE formulation involving a regularization based on a constant prior estimate of the unknown system parameters. Only assuming the existence of a stable state estimator, we prove that the proposed MHE approach results in practically robustly stable state estimates irrespective of PE. We discuss the relation of the proposed MHE formulation to state-of-the-art results from MHE and adaptive estimation. The properties of the proposed MHE approach are illustrated with a numerical example of a car with unknown tire friction parameters.",

    "abstract": "Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many settings. In particular, the performance properties of decentralized event-triggered control schemes with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we examine these performance properties for a consensus problem considering single-integrator agent dynamics, a level-triggering rule, and a complete communication graph. We consider the long-term average quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting, we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the relationship between two seemingly contrasting consistency results from the literature.",

    "abstract": "With a broad range of emerging applications in 6G networks, wireless traffic prediction has become a critical component of network management. However, the dynamically shifting distribution of wireless traffic in non-stationary 6G networks presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and stable predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI)-enabled 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel self-refined Large Language Model (LLM) for wireless traffic prediction, namely TrafficLLM, through in-context learning without parameter fine-tuning or model training. The proposed TrafficLLM harnesses the powerful few-shot learning abilities of LLMs to enhance the scalability of traffic prediction in dynamically changing wireless environments. Specifically, our proposed TrafficLLM embraces an LLM to iteratively refine its predictions through a three-step process: traffic prediction, feedback generation, and prediction refinement. Initially, the proposed TrafficLLM conducts traffic predictions using task-specific demonstration prompts. Recognizing that LLMs may generate incorrect predictions on the first attempt, this paper designs feedback demonstration prompts to provide multifaceted and valuable feedback related to these initial predictions. The validation scheme is further incorporated to systematically enhance the accuracy of mathematical calculations during the feedback generation process. Following this comprehensive feedback, our proposed TrafficLLM introduces refinement demonstration prompts, enabling the same LLM to further refine its predictions and thereby enhance prediction performance. Evaluations on two realistic datasets demonstrate that the proposed TrafficLLM outperforms LLM-based in-context learning methods, achieving performance improvements of 23.17% and 17.09%, respectively.",

Sparse-view CT alleviates this burden but yields incomplete sinograms with structured signal loss, hampering accurate reconstruction. Unlike RGB images, sinograms encode overlapping features along projection paths and exhibit distinct directional spectral patterns, which make conventional RGB-oriented inpainting approaches--including diffusion models--ineffective for sinogram restoration, as they disregard the angular dependencies and physical constraints inherent to tomographic data. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCDM, a diffusion-based framework tailored for sinograms, which restores global structure through bidirectional frequency reasoning and angular-aware masking, while enforcing physical plausibility via physics-guided constraints and frequency-adaptive noise control. Experiments on real-world datasets show that FCDM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving SSIM over 0.93 and PSNR above 31 dB across diverse sparse-view scenarios.",

To address this problem, we propose the use of Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (RN-SDEs), which are a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting (MR) stochastic differential equations. To demonstrate the generalizability of RN-SDEs, we conducted experiments with two different LACT datasets, ChromSTEM and C4KC-KiTS. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that by leveraging learned MR-SDEs as a prior and emphasizing data consistency using Range-Null Space Decomposition (RNSD) based rectification, we can recover high-quality images from severely degraded ones and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most LACT tasks.

In particular, $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{m \\times n}$ is a sparse random combinatorial matrix with independent columns, where each column is chosen uniformly among the vectors with exactly $d~(d \\leq m/2)$ ones. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the confined OMP algorithm, leverages the properties of the sparse signal $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and the measurement matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ to reduce redundancy in $\\boldsymbol{A}$, thereby requiring fewer column indices to be identified. To this end, we first define a confined set $\\Gamma$ with $|\\Gamma| \\leq n$ and then prove that the support of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is a subset of $\\Gamma$ with probability 1 if the distributions of nonzero components of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ satisfy a certain condition. During the process of the confined OMP algorithm, the possibly chosen column indices are strictly confined to the confined set $\\Gamma$.

Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its compact architecture, FSG-Net delivers performance competitive with SOTA methods across multiple public datasets.

    "abstract": "Constant-envelope signals are widely used in mobile edge applications and wireless communication systems for their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and reliability. However, reliable detection with simple, power-efficient receivers remains challenging. Coherent methods offer superior performance but require complex synchronization, increasing complexity and power use. Noncoherent detection is simpler, avoiding synchronization, but traditional approaches rely on in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators for signal magnitudes and assume energy detectors without theoretical justification. This paper proposes a framework for optimal detection using a bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) with Bayes criterion and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) under unknown amplitudes. Using modified Bessel function approximations, we show the optimal detector shifts based on SNR: in the low-SNR regime, we rigorously prove for the first time that the well-known energy detector (ED) is the Bayesian-optimal solution, thus providing a firm theoretical foundation for its widespread use; in high-SNR regimes, a novel amplitude detector (AD) compares estimated amplitude to noise deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection strategy. For unknown SNR, a reliability-based intelligent decision (RID) rule adaptively selects detectors, leveraging their strengths across SNR ranges. Simulations confirm energy and amplitude detectors minimize errors in their domains, with RID providing robust gains. The proposed framework provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and enables low-complexity implementations for resource-constrained, interference-limited mobile edge applications, including wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems.",

Traditional nonlinear closed-loop system identification methods struggle with reliance on precise noise models, robustness to data variations, or computational feasibility. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the identified model is stabilized by the same controller used during data collection, ensuring alignment with the true system's closed-loop behavior. The dual Youla parameterization provides a promising solution for linear systems, offering statistical guarantees and closed-loop stability. However, extending this approach to nonlinear systems presents additional complexities. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable framework for identifying complex, potentially unstable systems while ensuring closed-loop stability using a complete parameterization of systems stabilized by a given controller. We establish asymptotic consistency in the linear case and validate our method through numerical comparisons, demonstrating superior accuracy over direct identification baselines and compatibility with the true system in stability properties.",

    "abstract": "Markov games (MGs) provide a mathematical foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling self-interested agents to learn their optimal policies while interacting with others in a shared environment. However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has remained open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.",

    "abstract": "Many inverse problems and signal processing problems involve low-rank regularizers based on the nuclear norm. Commonly, proximal gradient methods (PGM) are adopted to solve this type of non-smooth problems as they can offer fast and guaranteed convergence. However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied in settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches; therefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence guarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth approximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value. By providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory, we show that important properties can be established for the proposed regularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Moreover, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularizer gradient, enabling the use of standard iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradient) that can easily address the case of overlapping patches and have well-known convergence guarantees. In addition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic majorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics of the proposed regularizer. Finally, we assess the proposed optimization framework by providing empirical results in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction in the context of local low-rank models with overlapping patches.",

Leveraging the specific signal processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the joint use of spectrum and hardware resources for radar sensing and data transmission, serving as a key enabler of next-generation wireless networks. However, most existing ISAC studies have been limited to operation within a single frequency band and have not been designed to adapt to diverse wireless propagation environments or user configurations. To address these limitations, this paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system employing an adaptive bandwidth-splitting strategy under near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) coexistence. The system comprises a full-duplex access point (AP), an RIS and multiple users, where an ISAC user (IU) is both a sensing target and a communication user in the NF region, while communication-only users (CUs) rely on the RIS and experience either NF or FF propagation depending on their placement. The proposed system jointly exploits traditional sensing-only (SO) and ISAC bands and adopts uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for simultaneous transmission. We formulate a joint optimization problem for the receive beamforming vector, bandwidth-splitting ratio, and RIS phase shifts to minimize the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) under rate and resource constraints. An efficient algorithm is developed based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework combined with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional schemes that operate solely in either the ISAC or SO band, achieving superior performance across various RIS and user configurations under hybrid NF and FF coexistence scenarios.",

Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.",

While extensive research has focused on computing high-quality OPF solutions, assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints. To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF test cases.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.",

This work addresses that gap by proposing a data-driven approach that learns Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors that only flag deviations, the proposed method assesses whether the system can still be certified as stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS severe turbulence incident, this framework revealed that, within 60 seconds of the aircraft's descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be constructed to certify system stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first application of a data-driven Lyapunov-based stability verification method to real civil aviation data, achieved without any access to proprietary controller logic.

    "abstract": "Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here, leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines. Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex systems.",

The design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects. To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also achieves superior target detection performance.

A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS features across all four domains. BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude and slope, providing supportive, but less stable, discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation can be traced to stable inter-individual differences in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry.

    "abstract": "Single-photon emission computed tomography for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI SPECT) is a widely used diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease. However, the procedure requires considerable scanning time, leading to patient discomfort and the potential for motion-induced artifacts. Reducing the number of projection views while keeping the time per view unchanged provides a mechanism to shorten the scanning time. However, this approach leads to increased sampling artifacts, higher noise, and hence limited image quality. To address these issues, we propose sparseview SPECT image enhancement (SPASHT), inherently training the algorithm to improve performance on defect-detection tasks. We objectively evaluated SPASHT on the clinical task of detecting perfusion defects in a retrospective clinical study using data from patients who underwent MPI SPECT, where the defects were clinically realistic and synthetically inserted. The study was conducted for different numbers of fewer projection views, including 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 of the typical projection views for MPI SPECT. Performance on the detection task was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Images obtained with SPASHT yielded significantly improved AUC compared to those obtained with the sparse-view protocol for all the considered numbers of fewer projection views. To further assess performance, a human observer study on the task of detecting perfusion defects was conducted. Results from the human observer study showed improved detection performance with images reconstructed using SPASHT compared to those from the sparse-view protocol. The results provide evidence of the efficacy of SPASHT in improving the quality of sparse-view MPI SPECT images and motivate further clinical validation.",

To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.",

In this paper, we explore the use of MA to improve physical layer security in an analog beamforming (AB) communication system. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit AB and MA position, subject to constant modulus (CM) constraints on the AB and position constraints for the MA. The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS. This method is efficient, providing an analytical solution at each step and ensuring convergence to a KKT point. Simulation results show that the MA system achieves a higher secrecy rate than systems with fixed-position antennas.",

    "abstract": "Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems.",

    "abstract": "Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

In such scenarios, remote assistance from a human can provide the required input for the vehicle to continue its operation. Typical sensors used in autonomous vehicles include camera and lidar sensors. Due to the massive volume of sensor data that must be sent in real-time, highly efficient data compression is elementary to prevent an overload of network infrastructure. Sensor data compression using deep generative neural networks has been shown to outperform traditional compression approaches for both image and lidar data, regarding compression rate as well as reconstruction quality. However, there is a lack of research about the performance of generative-neural-network-based compression algorithms for remote assistance. In order to gain insights into the feasibility of deep generative models for usage in remote assistance, we evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms regarding their applicability and identify potential weaknesses. Further, we implement an online pipeline for processing sensor data and demonstrate its performance for remote assistance using the CARLA simulator.",

    "abstract": "Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.",

We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth SDE structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification. In contrast to existing RL analyses that diverges as the sampling interval shrinks, the approximation error of PhiBE remains remains well-conditioned and independent of the discretization step by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.",

We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.",

Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system.

    "abstract": "Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.",

    "abstract": "Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software. This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.",

    "title": "Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication",
    "abstract": "As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain reliability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge, which may be part of the training set of the SemCom system, between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into a digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding based on the shared index of Y2, while the eavesdropper's decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves security comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.",

    "abstract": "Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.",

Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieves finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm. Our results hold for any periodic sequence of combination matrices. We clarify the interplay between approximation error of the finite-time consensus sequence and the length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, satellite-IoT systems using the LoRa technique have been increasingly deployed to provide widespread Internet services to low-power and low-cost ground devices. However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time, frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems, respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.",

    "title": "Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing",
    "abstract": "Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs.

Long-term audio generation is critical for applications in Text-to-Music (TTM) and Text-to-Audio (TTA) systems, where maintaining temporal coherence, prosodic consistency, and harmonic structure over extended durations remains a significant challenge. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD) + MED, MSD + MRD, and Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD)) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS).

    "abstract": "Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.",

The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.",

To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence.

We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this \"control gap\" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control.

Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes.

    "title": "Limit Theorems for Network Data without Metric Structure",
    "abstract": "This paper develops limit theorems for random variables with network dependence, without requiring that individuals in the network to be located in a Euclidean or metric space. This distinguishes our approach from most existing limit theorems in network econometrics, which are based on weak dependence concepts such as strong mixing, near-epoch dependence, and $\\psi$-dependence. By relaxing the assumption of an underlying metric space, our theorems can be applied to a broader range of network data, including financial and social networks. To derive the limit theorems, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (also known as physical dependence) from time series to random variables with network dependence. Using this framework, we establish several inequalities, a law of large numbers, and central limit theorems. Furthermore, we verify the conditions for these limit theorems based on primitive assumptions for spatial autoregressive models, which are widely used in network data analysis.",

By decomposing option value into switching and catalytic components, we show that high exploration rates can coexist with bounded switching probabilities. This mechanism generates three insights. First, strong catalytic motives cause separating equilibria to collapse in signaling games as receivers explore indiscriminately. Second, agents optimally acquire more precise information about the status quo than about alternatives, reversing rational inattention intuitions. Third, catalytic exploration creates negative externalities: information technology improvements can paradoxically reduce welfare by encouraging excessive benchmarking.",

We employ a selective conditional inference approach, deriving the conditional distribution of coefficient estimates given the group structure estimated from the data. Our procedure provides valid inference under possible violations of group separation, where distributional properties of group-specific coefficients remain unestablished. Furthermore, even when group separation does hold, our method demonstrates superior finite-sample properties compared to traditional asymptotic approaches. This improvement stems from our procedure's ability to account for statistical uncertainty in the estimation of group structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through Monte Carlo simulations and apply the methods to two datasets on: (i) the relationship between income and democracy, and (ii) the cyclicality of firm-level R&D investment.",

Despite several financial interventions targeted at increasing agricultural production, smallholder farmers continue to lack access to reasonable, timely, and sufficient financing, limiting their ability to invest in improved technology and inputs, lowering productivity and food supply. This study examines the relationship between access to finance and food security among smallholder farmers in Ogun State, employing institutional theory as a theoretical framework. The study takes a quantitative method, with a survey for the research design and a population of 37,200 agricultural smallholder farmers. A sample size of 380 was chosen using probability sampling and simple random techniques. The data were analysed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate a favourable relationship between access to finance and food security, with an R2-value of 0.615 indicating a robust link. These findings underline the need of improving financial institutions and implementing enabling policies to enable farmers have access to the financial resources they need to achieve food security outcomes.",

Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.",

This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior.",

We develop a unified computational framework (DP + Monte Carlo) that introduces Cognitive Heterogeneity across classes. Our Hybrid Model (M-H) posits that the poor act as \"Rational Survivors\" (M1 utility, Reality parameters), while the middle/rich act as \"Biased Strivers\" (M4b utility, Belief parameters). Our simulations yield three core findings. First, we confirm that the \"Survival\" strategy is objectively rational whenever risk exceeds a low threshold ($\\sigma > 0.45$). Given that real-world risk is massive ($\\sigma_{Real} \\approx 4.9$), the modern \"Quality\" strategy is objectively fragile. Second, the trap for the Middle/Rich ($B \\ge 200$) is driven by a \"Two-Stage Belief Error\": they are first \"baited\" by a Causal Error (underestimating risk) to enter the status game, and then \"trapped\" by a Marginal Error (underestimating returns) which triggers a stop in fertility. Third, the U-shape is driven by the cognitive divide. The Poor escape the trap by retaining a \"Rational Survival\" strategy in the face of real high risk. Conversely, the Aspirational Middle Class ($HC \\approx 12, B \\ge 200$) is uniquely trapped by their Biased Beliefs. Their high competence raises their dynastic reference point ($R$) to a level where, under perceived low returns, restricting fertility to $N=1$ becomes the only rational choice within their biased belief system.",

We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness. In addition, we propose an alternative estimator using a further reformulation of RMS as a special layer in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which allows the estimation procedure to be implemented via state-of-the-art software and hardware for DNN.",

Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets.",

The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.",

Our method employs basis expansions to construct high-dimensional nonlinear VAR models. We derive convergence rates and model selection consistency for least squared estimators, considering dependence measures of the processes, error moment conditions, sparsity, and basis expansions. Our theory significantly extends prior linear VAR models by incorporating both non-Gaussianity and non-linearity. As a key contribution, we derive sharp Bernstein-type inequalities for tail probabilities in both non-sub-Gaussian linear and nonlinear VAR processes, which match the classical Bernstein inequality for independent random variables. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of the nonlinear VAR model for a gene expression time series dataset.",

We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game. We further model intra-round dynamics using an index to capture coordinated asynchronous seller updates coupled through buyers' joint constraints. Together, these constructions explain how local interactions propagate across auctions and gives premise for coherent equilibria--without requiring global information or centralized control.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the impact of regulatory policies on social welfare generally requires the identification of counterfactual distributions. Many of these policies (e.g. minimum wages or minimum working time) generate mass points and/or discontinuities in the outcome distribution. Existing approaches in the difference-in-difference literature cannot accommodate these discontinuities while accounting for selection on unobservables and non-stationary outcome distributions. We provide a unifying partial identification result that can account for these features. Our main identifying assumption is the stability of the dependence (copula) between the distribution of the untreated potential outcome and group membership (treatment assignment) across time. Exploiting this copula stability assumption allows us to provide an identification result that is invariant to monotonic transformations. We provide sharp bounds on the counterfactual distribution of the treatment group suitable for any outcome, whether discrete, continuous, or mixed. Our bounds collapse to the point-identification result in Athey and Imbens (2006) for continuous outcomes with strictly increasing distribution functions. We illustrate our approach and the informativeness of our bounds by analyzing the impact of an increase in the legal minimum wage using data from a recent minimum wage study (Cengiz et al 2019).",

The threshold reserve model we introduce supports independent priority orderings, mixtures of hard and soft reserves, and overlapping categories, thereby capturing both beneficiary designations and eligibility constraints while offering policymakers greater flexibility. Our Iterative Max-in-Max Assignment Mechanism (IMMAM) satisfies all desirable properties in this domain: it respects priorities within categories, maximizes resource utilization, and then lexicographically maximizes beneficiary assignments. IMMAM is path independent and therefore well-behaved in settings with multiple institutions making simultaneous allocation decisions. We leverage path independence to obtain comparative statics and to significantly improve the mechanism's computational efficiency. We outline applications of our framework in the context of vaccine allocation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread implementation of conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries, evidence on their long-term effects remains limited. This paper evaluates the impact of Ecuador's Human Development Grant on the formal labour market outcomes of children from eligible households. The programme, one of the first of its kind, was characterised by weak enforcement of its eligibility criteria. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the grant increased the probability of working in the formal sector by almost 13\\% around 15 years after exposure, thereby helping to curb the intergenerational transmission of poverty. This positive effect is most likely to operate through human capital accumulation.",

    "title": "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Causal Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "The credibility revolution advances the use of research designs that permit identification and estimation of causal effects. However, understanding which mechanisms produce measured causal effects remains a challenge. The dominant current approach to the quantitative evaluation of mechanisms relies on the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) with respect to pre-treatment covariates. This paper develops a framework to understand when the existence of such heterogeneous treatment effects can support inferences about the activation of a mechanism. We show first that this design cannot provide evidence of mechanism activation without additional, generally implicit, exclusion assumptions. Further, even when these assumptions are satisfied, the presence of HTEs supports the inference that mechanism is active but the absence of HTEs is generally uninformative about mechanism activation. We provide novel guidance for interpretation and research design in light of these findings.",

Our procedures accommodate various data scenarios in which the number of defendants handled by a judge may be either small or large, and allow for discrete or continuous instrumental variables. When the validity of the design is rejected, a variant of the marginal treatment effect can be identified under weaker assumptions. We apply our test to the Philadelphia court data studied by Stevenson (2018) and demonstrate that it outperforms non-sharp joint tests by significant margins in simulation studies",

By constructing LLM Agents equipped with various functional modules, we replicate three representative survey experiments involving several expectations across different types of economic agents. Our results show that although the expectations simulated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of humans, they consistently outperform LLMs relying simply on prompt engineering, and possess human-like mental mechanisms. Evaluation reveals that these capabilities stem from the contributions of their components, offering guidelines for their architectural design. Our approach complements traditional methods and provides new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research",

    "abstract": "We study a dynamic labor market in which a risk-averse worker with career concerns chooses each period between self-employment, which generates publicly observed binary output, and employment at a firm, which pays a flat wage but keeps individual performance hidden from the outside market. The worker values future opportunities through a reputation for talent, understood as the public belief used by firms to set wages. Firms may be myopic, pricing only off public beliefs, or sophisticated, inferring from who is expected to apply. Three forces organize the results: an insurance - information trade-off, selection by talent, and inference from application decisions. A self-confirming absorbing hidden-employment region arises naturally when the value of insurance dominates the value of additional public signals, so some workers optimally stop generating public information. At any public belief there is a unique talent cutoff governing selection into self-employment, and sophisticated firms, by internalizing application-based inference, compress wages and induce different patterns of public information production than myopic firms. The framework yields testable predictions for the prevalence of self-employment, switching into opaque jobs, and wage dynamics across markets with different degrees of performance transparency.",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge in research on causal panel data models, leading to many new estimators for average causal effects. However, researchers have paid less attention to quantifying the precision of these estimators. This paper addresses that gap by studying the problem of variance estimation in causal panel settings. We develop a unified framework for comparing the three main variance estimators used in these settings: regression-based, Unit-Placebo, and Time-Placebo estimators. We show that each relies on a distinct exchangeability assumption and, correspondingly, each targets a different conditional variance. We find that, under some assumptions, all three estimators are all valid, but that their statistical power differs substantially depending on the heteroskedasticity present in the data. Building on these insights, we propose a new variance estimator that flexibly accounts for heteroskedasticity across the unit and time dimensions, and delivers superior statistical power in realistic panel data settings.",

We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).",

I also propose specification tests to determine whether the conformity model or the spillover model is consistent with the observed data in the presence of heterogeneous peer effects. Applying the model to data on smoking and alcohol consumption among secondary school students, I show that assuming a homogeneous preference for conformity leads to biased estimates.",

    "title": "The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment with 40 different products as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process. We show formally that confoundness stems from ambiguous prompting strategies. Therefore, it can be addressed by developing unambiguous prompting strategies through unblinding, i.e., revealing the experiment design in LLM simulations. Our empirical results show that this strategy consistently enhances model performance across all tested models, including both out-of-box reasoning and non-reasoning models. We also show that it is a technique that complements fine-tuning: while fine-tuning can improve simulation performance, an unambiguous prompting strategy makes the predictions robust to the inclusion of irrelevant data in the fine-tuning process.",
