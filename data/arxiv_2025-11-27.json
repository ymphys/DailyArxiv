    "title": "High-energy radiation from the pulsar Equatorial Current Sheet",
    "abstract": "Pulsars emit beams of radiation that reveal the extreme physics of neutron star magnetospheres. Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere.",

    "abstract": "I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.",

    "abstract": "We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \\textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.",

Three of the four CO emitters are multiple images of the same galaxy. Compared to previous line-emitter searches in ALMA deep fields, our sample probes molecular gas masses $\\sim$1 dex below the lower bound, thanks to gravitational lensing (typically $\\mu \\sim 4$, up to $\\sim$30 in extreme cases). Most emitters are located in a region similar to normal star-forming galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus molecular gas mass plane. To reduce dependence on SFR and stellar mass, we analyzed the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence. We found that most emitters broadly follow the scaling relations from previous studies, consistent within the intrinsic scatter. In addition, we serendipitously detected the CH $N = 1$, $J = 3/2 \\rightarrow 1/2$ $\\Lambda$-doublet transition from one CO emitter at $z = 1.142$, representing the first detection of CH from an individual galaxy at cosmological distances through a blind survey. The CH/CO column density ratio of $\\sim$$10^{-4}$ is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays.",

Using the footprints of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we query and uniformly reprocess ALMA data to produce continuum images and two complementary source catalogues: (i) a prior-based catalogue anchored to optical/near-infrared detections, and (ii) a blind catalogue based on significant ALMA detections. Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 < z < 15.0$. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from $0.12 < z < 6.85$. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage.",

    "abstract": "Carbon (C) is thought to be produced by both core collapse supernovae (CCSN) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, but the relative contributions of these two sources are uncertain. We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate.",

Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM.",

Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.",

    "abstract": "We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ model (yielding $M_\\nu<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\\nu<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $o\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ and $M_\\nu<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\\nu$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.",

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects.",

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10${\\mu}$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10${\\mu}$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime.",

We use 17 simulated low-mass galaxies from the Auriga Project ($\\sim 3 \\times 10^8 \\, M_\\odot \\leq M_* \\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$). We study the metallicity and the ages of these galaxies and their stellar halos, as well as the relation between these two properties. We find that all galaxies have negative radial [Fe/H] gradients, and that the centres of less massive dwarfs are generally more metal poor than those of more massive dwarfs. We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime. We also find that the dispersion in the mass-metallicity relation found in the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies can be explained with the infall time of their most dominant satellite: at a fixed accreted stellar halo mass, dwarf galaxies that accreted this satellite at later times have more metal-rich accreted stellar halos. Regarding the ages of the analysed galaxies, we find a prominent U-shape in the radial mean age profiles of $\\sim 65\\%$ of them, which is mainly driven by the in situ stellar material. This presence of a U-shape in the age profiles is due to the combination of the cessation of recent star formation at large radial distances and the merger events these galaxies undergo, which redistribute the stellar material to their outer regions. When focusing on the ages of the stellar halos, we find that more massive ones are older than less massive ones. Our results show a wide variety in ages and metallicities of low-mass galaxies and their stellar halos, reflecting the complex and non-uniform evolutionary pathways these systems can follow.",

    "abstract": "Mass loss in oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars remains poorly understood, as the dust detected around them appears too transparent to drive winds through absorption alone. The current paradigm invokes outflows driven by photon scattering on relatively large grains ($\\sim0.3\\,\\mu$m), but whether such grains exist in sufficient quantities remains uncertain. We test whether the dust around the oxygen-rich AGB star R~Doradus can drive its wind by combining polarimetric constraints, elemental abundance limits, and force-balance calculations. We examine Fe-free silicates (MgSiO$_3$), alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), and Fe-bearing silicates (MgFeSiO$_4$) to evaluate whether any species can produce enough radiative pressure under realistic conditions. Using high-angular-resolution polarimetric observations from SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the VLT, we model the circumstellar dust with RADMC-3D and explore a broad parameter space in grain size, density structure, and wavelength-dependent stellar radius. For models consistent with the observations, we assess wind feasibility using updated gas-density profiles, elemental depletion constraints, and radiation-pressure thresholds. Although several dust configurations reproduce the observed scattering patterns, none generate sufficient radiative force at realistic gas-to-dust ratios, even under maximal elemental depletion. Our results for R~Doradus indicate that photon scattering on dust cannot by itself launch the wind, implying that additional mechanisms must contribute.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks are an essential component of the planet-formation process. The amount of dust and gas in the disk constrains the number and size of planets that can form in a system. We analyze 178 T-Tauri stars, 18 in Serpens and 160 in L1641/L1647, and measure their disk dust masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and multiwavelength data, including 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) fluxes from the literature. The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.",

    "abstract": "We report the detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH) toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Compact Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on UT 2025 August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, and of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on September 12 and 15. These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS).",

We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model.",

Galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) are difficult to estimate accurately without spectroscopic diagnostics or far-infrared (FIR) photometry, both of which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for large numbers of faint, high-redshift galaxies. Here we present the empirical relation between SFR and broadband optical-to-NIR colors learned from Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging using an innovative stacking analysis that bins galaxies with similar optical-to-NIR spectral energy distributions using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Stacking based on optical-to-NIR colors ensures that our FIR stacks are built from galaxies with similar intrinsic physical properties as opposed to stacking simply by stellar mass. We train a 40$\\times$40 SOM using 230,638 galaxies selected from the COSMOS field, and stack the mid-to-far infrared images from 24 micron to 500 micron. We are able to measure the median FIR luminosities from half of the SOM cells to calibrate the star formation rate. In addition to investigating the common structures of optical-to-NIR properties and FIR detections labeled on the SOM, we provide calibrated star formation rates for nearly half of the galaxies in the COSMOS fields down to $i-$band magnitude $\\leq 25.5$, and present the evolution of the galaxy main sequence for low-mass galaxies to redshift $z\\sim2.5$.",

Among them are the relatively rare $\\gamma$ Doradus / $\\delta$ Scuti ($\\gamma$ Dor / $\\delta$ Sct) hybrid pulsators, which have been previously studied using Kepler data. These stars are perfect laboratories to probe both inner and outer interior stellar layers thanks to them exhibiting both pressure and gravity modes. We seek to classify an all-sky sample of AF stars observed by TESS to find previously undiscovered hybrid pulsators and supply them in a catalogue of candidates. We also aim to compare the light curves produced with the TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) pipeline, currently underused in variability studies, with other publicly available light curves. We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \\kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\\%. The analysis of dominant frequencies in high-probability candidates shows that we find more pressure-mode dominant hybrids.

COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.",

Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\\lesssim 20,000 M_{\\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical study of high-order gravity-mode period spacing ($\\Delta P_g$) pattern is relevant for the better understanding of internal properties of intermediate-mass ($1.5 \\, M_\\odot < M < 8 \\, M_{\\odot}$) main-sequence g-mode pulsators. In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency on the $\\Delta P_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \\, M_\\odot < M < 3 \\, M_{\\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $\\Delta P_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $\\Delta P_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\\sim 2 \\, M_\\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $\\Delta P_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $\\Delta P_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $\\Delta P_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $\\gamma$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates.",

Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centers of mass of these two components. Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations. These matter -- dark matter oscillations may affect direction and magnitude of the dark matter wind coming to Earth.",

    "abstract": "In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.",

The survey covers $\\sim4.5$deg$^{2}$ over three extragalactic fields to Y$_{AB}<21.2$mag and probes sources at $0<z<1.2$, with a median redshift of $z=0.53$. Here we describe the DEVILS spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift analysis. We then describe and release to the community all DEVILS data in the 10h (D10, COSMOS) region including: i) catalogues of redshifts, photometry, SED fitting for physical properties, visual morphologies, structural decompositions and group environments/halo masses, ii) matched imaging in 28 bands from x-rays to radio continuum, and iii) reduced 1D spectra. All data are made publicly available through Data Central. Within D10 we obtain 5,442 new high-quality spectroscopic redshifts. When combined with existing, lower-quality, redshift information ($i.e.$ photometric redshifts) this is increased to 7,946. Of these, 3,122 have a spectroscopic redshift from another source (many that was not available at the time of the DEVILS observations). As such, DEVILS provides new unique high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for 4,824 faint sources in COSMOS. This increases the spectroscopic completeness at Y-mag$\\sim$21 from $\\sim$50% in other samples to $\\sim$90% in DEVILS. Finally, we show the power of this dataset by exploring the suppression of star formation in over-dense environments, split by morphology and stellar mass, and highlighting the ubiquitous nature of environmental quenching.",

A substantial fraction of dEs are known to harbor central nuclei, which are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. The large-scale distribution and the underlying origin of nucleated and non-nucleated dEs remain unresolved. Using a state-of-the-art machine learning framework, we systematically scan the Virgo cluster region ($15\\arcdeg \\times 20\\arcdeg$ centered at $R.A. = 187.2\\arcdeg$ and $Dec. = 9.6\\arcdeg$) and construct the largest homogeneous sample of dEs (of total 2,123) with robust nucleus classifications. We find that nucleated dEs are more spatially clustered and exhibit a stronger association with massive galaxies than their non-nucleated counterparts. This suggests that most nucleated dEs likely formed alongside massive galaxies within the cluster (i.e, the in-situ formation). In contrast, non-nucleated dEs are more widely distributed across the cluster and align more closely with Virgo's global potential well, as traced by the cluster's hot gas. This indicates that most non-nucleated dEs originated outside the cluster (i.e, the ex-situ formation) and were later accreted and redistributed within it. Our findings shed new light on how dEs and their central nuclei form and evolve.",

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy.

Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS.

For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1$\\times$10^{5} km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.",

We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.",

Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.",

Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands.

    "abstract": "Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present a spatially resolved analysis of the molecular star formation law (SFL) and gravitational instability in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies (NGC 1035, NGC 4310, NGC 4451, NGC 4701, NGC 5692, and NGC 6106), using high-resolution $^{12}$CO ($J=1\\rightarrow0$) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) by combining the Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 $\\mu$m imaging data to examine the relationship between molecular gas and SFR densities on scales of several hundred parsecs. We find that the power-law slope of the molecular SFL ranges from 0.62 to 1.08, with an average value of N$=0.81\\pm0.18$, increasing to N$=0.87\\pm0.05$ when excluding galaxies with poorly constrained CO data. These results are roughly consistent with values observed in massive spiral galaxies, suggesting a universal molecular SFL when analyzed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity. Radial profiles of the Toomre $Q$ parameter remain close to unity across the disks, with minimal radial variation, consistent with a self-regulated star formation model. Our results suggest that, despite their lower mass and metallicity, star formation in dwarf galaxies is governed by the same fundamental physical processes as in larger systems. This highlights the significance of high-resolution molecular gas observations in low-mass galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The stellar origin of the elements molybdenum (Mo, Z=42) and ruthenium (Ru, Z=44) is still a matter of debate. Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed.",

    "abstract": "Building on our previous work, we apply a U-Net Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to denoise galaxy images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and enhance morphological classification. This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe. The results highlight the potential of VAE-based denoising as a robust pre-processing step for analyzing high-redshift galaxy populations in ongoing astronomical surveys.",

    "abstract": "Shock types of low-velocity molecular outflows are not always well constrained. Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies.",

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\\rm 0.5-7\\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\\rm 0.5-7\\ keV}=10^{42.31\\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.",

HERA Phase II constitutes several significant improvements in the signal chain compared to Phase I, most notably resulting in expanded frequency bandwidth, from 50-250 MHz. In these first upper limits, we investigate a small two-week subset of the available Phase II observations, with a focus on identifying new systematic characteristics of the instrument, and establishing an analysis pipeline to account for them.

In classical theories of non-accreting planetary migration, both type I and type II migration typically result in inward migration, which is hard to align with the architecture of the planetary this http URL this work, we conduct systematic, high-resolution 3D/2D numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the migration of an accreting planet. Under different disk conditions, we compared the dynamical evolution of planets with different planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that accretion of planets can significantly diminish the inward migration tendency of planets, or even change the migration direction. The migration of low-/high-mass planets is classified as Type I/II inward migration, respectively, while intermediate-mass planets, which have the strongest accretion, show an outward migration trend. We confirm that the outward migration is mainly attributed to the positive torque from the azimuthal asymmetric structures around the accreting planet, similar to Li et al. (2024). The termination of planetary mass growth is thus synonymous with the transition from outward to inward migration. For the high viscosity $\\alpha=0.04$ and disk aspect ratio height $h_0=0.05$ cases, the mass ratio range for planetary outward migration is $1\\times10^{-4}\\lesssim q\\lesssim4\\times10^{-3}$. For the low viscosity case with $\\alpha=0.001$, and/or the low disk aspect ratio cases $h_0=0.03$, the mass ratio range for the outward migration will shift toward the lower end. Our parameter survey reveals that a simple gap opening parameter determines the outward migration condition; details of the analytical interpretation are presented in Ida et al. (2025).",

Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.",

    "abstract": "In binary systems, studying tidal interactions is key to understanding the evolution of binary populations. The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies.",

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.",

    "title": "Quantifying the differences in transmission and emission spectra for hot irradiated gaseous exoplanet Atmospheres: A comparison of 1D and 3D modeling using JWST",
    "abstract": "Modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets is fundamental to understanding their atmospheric physics and chemical processes. While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.",

    "abstract": "Stage-IV surveys will enable unprecedented tests of gravity on cosmological scales. However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\\sim12\\sigma$ for both $\\{\\Omega_{\\rm m}, \\sigma_8\\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys.",

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 years with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented dataset will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX, a scalable light curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST's multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\\sim 10^2-10^4 \\times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX's multiband capability allows robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs -- such as those residing in dwarf galaxies -- through their distinctive variability signatures.",

    "title": "The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds",
    "abstract": "Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) occasionally show signs of outflowing material from the accretion disk. Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\\log{(\\xi/{\\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\\log{(n_H/{\\rm cm^{-3})}}\\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy mergers are known to trigger bursts of central star formation, which should therefore lead to stellar mass growth in their inner regions. However, observational measurements of this `burst mass fraction' are scant. Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers.",

A significant milestone was achieved with the blazar TXS 0506+056, which was found to be in a flaring state of high gamma-ray emission and associated at the 3$\\sigma$ level with a 290 TeV neutrino detected by IceCube in September 2017. This discovery motivated deeper exploration of the theoretical link between photon and neutrino emissions. In this context, simulations of proton-photon interactions in blazars and radiative processes are conducted using advanced numerical codes to predict neutrino spectra. The LeHa-Paris code, previously applied to TXS 0506+056, enables the computation of both leptonic and hadronic components of blazar spectral energy distributions, facilitating exploration of a broad parameter space. In this work, starting from the case of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest and most studied High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), known for its extreme variability and subject of multi-wavelength observational campaigns, a methodology has been developed to extend neutrino flux templates, optimized via LeHa-Paris, to the full class of HBLs. Afterwards, neutrino emission models for a subset of HBLs from the 3HSP catalogue are derived.",

In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $\\beta$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\\beta$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $\\beta$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.",

    "abstract": "We quantify galaxy correlations using two distinct three-dimensional samples from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI): the Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) and the Luminous Red Galaxy Sample (LRGS). Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\\langle n(r) \\rangle \\propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \\sim 400$~\\text{Mpc}/$h$.",

    "abstract": "Spider systems are a class of close binaries in which a neutron star first accretes from a normal companion, and later ablates it in some cases. New observations have expanded this category, with the addition of a Huntsman group, tentatively linked to a short donor phase along the red bump in the secondary evolutionary track. We present explicit evolutionary tracks that support the Huntsman nature recently suggested, and discuss how the whole class of spiders emerges from the full consideration of irradiation and ablating winds. We address the irradiation feedback (IFB) effects and the hydrogen-shell burning detachment (HSBD) simultaneously, and show that they act independently and do not interfere with each other, supporting a physical picture of the Huntsman group. We employ our binary evolution code to compute a suite of binary systems formed by a donor star and a neutron star for different initial orbital periods, assuming solar composition and Z=0.01. Although many models do not consider IFB, we also present the evolution with IFB for one system as an example. We found that the recently suggested association of Huntsman pulsar with the evolutionary stage where (as a consequence of the dynamics of HSBD) the system remains detached for a few million years is plausible. However, this feature alone is unable to account for the occurrence of Redback spider pulsars. Meanwhile, models including IFB, with pulsed mass transfer, display detachment episodes that can be naturally associated with the Redback stage. Irradiation feedback does not preclude or modify HSBD and in fact, Huntsman systems were already present as an implicit prediction in our earlier calculations. We conclude that Huntsman is an expected stage of the spider systems under quite general conditions. This is another step towards a unified picture of spider pulsars as a group.",

    "abstract": "We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\\dot{P} = 0.04\\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \\gtrsim 3.1 \\times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.",

Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass ($\\log(M_{*} / M_{\\odot}) = 11.15 \\pm 0.16$) and redshift ($z_{\\text{phot}} = 3.62_{-0.04}^{+0.06}$) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be $\\mu_{\\text{max}} = 3.2$, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least $\\lambda_{\\text{Edd}}^{\\text{intrinsic}} > 4.9$. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among $z>5$ supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe.",

    "title": "Evidence For A Correlation Between Astrophysical Neutrinos and Radio Flares",
    "abstract": "We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for evidence of a correlation between radio variability and the detection of astrophysical neutrinos. We find an excess number of associations between flaring radio sources and neutrinos that were detected between the first and second VLASS observations at $>2\\sigma$ confidence. This excess is consistent with radio flares contributing $\\sim13\\,\\%$ of the astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. Notably $>80\\,\\%$ of the radio flares associated with neutrinos are not detected at either $\\gamma$-ray or X-ray wavelengths, highlighting the importance of radio observations for identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. No excess in the number of associations between the wider radio-variable population and the IceCube neutrinos is seen when no time constraint is placed on the neutrino detection. We predict that data from future VLASS epochs will see an excess number of associations between radio flares and neutrinos at the $>3\\sigma$ level, and expected improvements to the positional constraints on the neutrinos may increase that confidence to $>5\\sigma$, should our results be representative.",

    "title": "Axion Constraints from White Dwarf Cooling in 47 Tucanae",
    "abstract": "We analyse the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae to look for evidence of axion emission affecting the rate of white dwarf cooling. If axions exist and couple to electrons, then axions could be produced at an appreciable rate in the electron-degenerate core of a white dwarf through axion bremsstrahlung from electrons. The emission of these axions would provide an additional cooling mechanism for white dwarfs that would affect the cooling rate, and hints of axions have been suggested based on observations of anomalous cooling reported for white dwarfs in the Galactic disc and halo. We performed stellar evolution simulations of white dwarf cooling that accounted for the additional energy loss due to axion bremsstrahlung from electrons, producing a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different values of the axion-electron coupling constant, as well as the white dwarf mass and envelope thickness. These cooling models are compared to observations of white dwarfs in 47 Tucanae from the Hubble Space Telescope through an unbinned likelihood analysis. The optimal model found by this analysis corresponds to the case of no axion emission with a thick white dwarf envelope, and we find a new bound on the axion-electron coupling of $g_{aee} \\leq 0.81 \\times 10^{-13}$ at 95% confidence level. This improves upon the previous white dwarf cooling bound for this coupling and excludes the range of values favoured by the axion hints from the anomalous cooling of Galactic white dwarfs.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.",

    "abstract": "We study the cosmological predictions of (extended) Proca-Nuevo theory. This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\\sigma$ to $2.3\\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.",

In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\\Omega_c \\approx 5\\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant.

Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.",

Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.",

Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $\\sigma$ allows for the coupling $N S \\sigma$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\\rightarrow S\\sigma$), and (ii) for $T_{\\rm EW}<T_{\\rm rh}\\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $\\sigma-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $\\sigma-h$ coupling is small, then $\\sigma$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($\\sigma\\rightarrow S\\nu$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\\Delta{N}_{\\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $\\Delta{N}_{\\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.",

This study presents a realistic pipeline to improve $r$ constraints using foreground-cleaned maps with negligible residuals. The pipeline, based on simulations, is adaptable for future experiments. We focus on two delensing approaches: (1) subtracting the gradient-order lensing B-mode template, computed by convolving the E-mode with the lensing potential, from the observed B-mode signal; and (2) remapping observations using the estimated inverse deflection angle. For parameter constraints, we employ three models to reduce $r$ uncertainty and bias, finding consistent uncertainties across models, though biases vary due to the multipole-dependence of the delensing fraction. %We demonstrate the pipeline using simulated maps from future CMB polarization experiments, including a small-aperture (sub-1m) telescope, a large-aperture (6m) telescope, and a future space mission (3m). We demonstrated this pipeline using simulated observation maps from future CMB polarization experiments, which included current representative ground-based small aperture telescopes (sub-1m), next-generation ground-based large aperture telescopes (6m), and highly competitive future space-based medium aperture missions (3m). Results show a delensing efficiency of 40\\% with the small-aperture telescope alone, increasing to 65\\% when combined with the large-aperture telescope, and 80\\% with the satellite mission.

For example, the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) project on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) aims to observe over 3,000 hours spread over hundreds of observing sessions, covering two pointings and two frequency settings. The two primary problems encountered when processing this data are the need for storage and that processing is primarily I/O limited. To address these issues, we have implemented an deep imaging pipeline based on the storage of an intermediate data product in the software ASKAPSoft, that of the uv-gridded data, and have demonstrated lossy and lossless compression of this data on ASKAP, using MGARD and ADIOS2 libraries. We find data compression ratios from a factor of 7 (lossless) up to 20 (using lossy compression with an absolute error bound of $10^{-4}$), and processing is faster by a factor of 7 for lossless compression. We discuss the effectiveness of lossy MGARD compression and its adherence to the designated error bounds, the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the potential consequences of these I/O and storage improvements on the science quality of the data products.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying matter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in cosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence ($\\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks, which seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making method. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary conditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\\kappa$ maps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by integrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence field over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a scale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts: large-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale analysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both analyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\\kappa$ map. We tested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks, demonstrating that the reconstructed $\\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high accuracy. For the reconstructed $\\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the reconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\\kappa^{\\rm{rec}}$ and the correlation coefficient with the true $\\kappa$ map $r_\\ell$ achieve accuracies of $(1-C_\\ell^{\\rm{rec}}/C_\\ell^{\\rm{true}}) \\lesssim 1\\%$ and $(1-r_\\ell) \\lesssim 1\\%$, respectively.

    "abstract": "We report the modeling of the millimeter and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of 71 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with a lower flux-density limit of 8 mJy at 220 GHz (1.4 mm). All sources were cross-identified with Herschel surveys at 500, 350, and 250 {\\mu}m, and nineteen of our sources were observed at with the Submillimeter Array. A probabilistic cataloging algorithm, PCAT, favors multiple unresolved flux components in the Herschel data for the majority of ACT-selected DSFGs. We compare the derived physical properties of the DSFGs obtained from modeling the flux densities with those from similar studies of both lensed and unlensed DSFG populations. We find the median, 16th and 84th percentiles for the following model parameters: redshift zphot=3.3(+0.7)(-0.6), apparent size {\\mu}d=5.2(+0.9)(-2.4) kpc, apparent dust mass log10({\\mu}Md/Msun)=9.14(+0.12)(-0.04) and cutoff temperature Tc=35.6(+4.8)(-1.6) K, and the corresponding apparent far-infrared luminosity log10({\\mu}LIR/Lsun)=13.6(+0.2)(-0.3), where {\\mu} is lensing magnification. While many of the properties broadly agree with those of samples of primarily lensed DSFGs, we exercise caution in interpreting them. ACT's lower flux limit, the PCAT decomposition, and the higher-resolution SMA observations all suggest that some fraction of these DSFGs are likely to be unlensed and possibly multiples. The SMA data indicate that at least fourteen out of nineteen sources are such, either via \"missing\" flux in comparison to the ensemble model or detection of additional sources in the fields. Additional high-resolution follow-up and targeted redshift observations are needed to better understand this flux-limited sample of DSFGs.",

    "title": "Delensing for Precision Cosmology: Optimizing Future CMB B-mode Surveys to Constrain r",
    "abstract": "The detection of primordial B-modes, a key probe of cosmic inflation, is increasingly challenged by contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by large-scale structure (LSS). We present a delensing pipeline designed to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing reliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using simulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS surveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes (l<200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing potential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct the lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE) applied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to improve delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order template and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode templates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40 percent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction, improving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate our results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian approximation, finding consistent constraints on r. Our work establishes a streamlined framework for ground-based CMB experiments, demonstrating that synergies with LSS surveys significantly enhance sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves.",

    "title": "Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation",
    "abstract": "Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.",

For temperatures $\\gtrsim 7 \\times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\\approx 0.1 M_\\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \\times 10^4$y.

    "title": "Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots",
    "abstract": "Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of $A_V \\gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential \"dust budget crisis\" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly and consistently constrained to $A_V \\lesssim 1.0-1.5$ mag for A2744-45924, RUBIES-BLAGN-1, and stacked SEDs from a large sample of LRDs under the SMC extinction law, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$ values yield radiative efficiencies of $\\sim 10\\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Sołtan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.",

    "title": "The Impact of $Ω_{m0}$ Prior Bias on Cosmological Parameter Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination Results",
    "abstract": "Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe) observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameters ($\\oo, \\oa$) from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model predictions ($\\oo=-1, \\oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\\Omo$ prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a statistical analysis using 1000 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\\oo$, $\\oa$, and $\\Omo$ causes significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\\Omo$ prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an $\\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock data, assuming a true $\\Lambda$CDM universe ($\\Omo=0.30, \\oo=-1, \\oa=0$), yields biased estimates such as $\\oo \\approx -0.82 \\pm 0.06$ and $\\oa \\approx -0.82 \\pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\\Omo$ prior, moves the estimated parameters towards the non-$\\Lambda$CDM region, offering a qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO + Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\\oa = -0.17 \\pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\\Lambda$CDM parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\\Omo$ prior tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.",

    "abstract": "We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \\times 10^{4} M_\\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.",

We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations.

    "abstract": "Spectroscopic studies of massive and luminous O-type stellar atmospheres and winds have primarily been done by using 1D, spherically symmetric and stationary models. Both observations and modern theoretical models show that such stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We present first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model atmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D simulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative transfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well as integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation numbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering source functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star reveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local emergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles of optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or microturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity dispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs are larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source functions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening of the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively well-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly structured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results further suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our models without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We also discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future studies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.",

    "title": "Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data",
    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\\eta(z)=D_{\\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$; (ii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\\eta_0$ and $M_{\\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.",

Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei.

In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax.\" This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We began the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB.

    "abstract": "With dayside temperatures elevated enough for all atmospheric constituents to be present in gas form, ultra-hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to probe the composition of giant planets. We aim to infer the composition and thermal structure of the dayside atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b from two NIRISS$/$SOSS secondary eclipses observed as part of a full phase curve. We extract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction pipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to explore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium condensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed dayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a stratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral contributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We measure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched (~10x stellar) but comparatively titanium poor (~1x stellar), potentially due to partial cold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether reflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a geometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted Ag = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be consistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere enriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory titanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap. Considering H2O dissociation is critical in free retrieval analyses, leading to order-of-magnitude differences in retrieved abundances for WASP-121b if neglected. Simple chemical equilibrium retrievals assuming that all species are governed by a single metallicity parameter drastically overpredict the TiO abundance.",

    "title": "Deciphering galaxy images using machine vision -- Combining variational autoencoder and principal component analysis for feature extraction",
    "abstract": "Here, we present a machine vision approach, combining a VAE framework with PCA, to decipher galaxy images. Using mock gri-band images from the EAGLE simulation, the VAE finds that around 35 features are needed to describe the images. Adding the PCA, we identify an optimal range of 10-12 features needed to capture 99.9% of the variance in galaxy images. The exact optimal number varies with galaxy complexity: disk-dominated galaxies require 12 features, bulge-dominated galaxies need 9, and intermediate systems require 10-11 features. Correlations between extracted PCA features and structural measurements reveal that the VAE prioritizes galaxy size during reconstruction, with half-light radius strongly correlating with the highest-ranked principal components. Subsequent features capture morphology-dependent characteristics: disk-dominated galaxies emphasize size, asymmetry, and position angle; bulge-dominated systems focus on size, concentration, and axis ratio; while intermediate galaxies show enhanced attention to Sersic index, indicating greater emphasis on accurately reproducing both disk and bulge structures. The PCA process significantly reduces the entanglement of the features compared to the raw VAE latent features, decreasing the correlations with the half-light radius and the Sersic index from 14.5+-1.0 and 6.0+-1.5 features, respectively, to only 2.0+-1.0 components after PCA. Using UMAP, we construct two-dimensional visualizations that preserve neighborhood relationships from the high-dimensional feature space. This demonstrates that machine vision can effectively distinguish galaxy populations across different morphological types, including systems with atypical structures that may be overlooked by traditional classification methods, providing a data-driven complement to conventional structural measurements.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients with very shallow light-curve declines and weak AGN activity in their host galaxies, have been reported. Stars form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears in low-luminosity AGNs. We propose that the tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are more energetic and evolve more slowly than typical tidal disruption events (TDEs), without the black hole mass limit as in TDEs. In this scenario, the SMBH capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{7.5}\\,M_\\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \\(\\gtrsim10^{45}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}\\) in weak AGNs even with SMBH mass much larger than $10^{8}\\,M_\\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.",

    "abstract": "Boxy/peanut and X-shaped (BP/X) bulges are prominent features in edge-on disk galaxies and are believed to be vertically thickened bars. Despite their relevance in bar evolution, a statistically robust census of these structures in large surveys has been lacking. We aim to provide the largest catalog of BP/X structures in edge-on galaxies to date, and to investigate their properties and role in shaping galaxy scaling relations. We selected a sample of 6684 edge-on galaxies from SDSS DR8 using Galaxy Zoo classifications, requiring a high edge-on probability ($> 0.9$) and a minimum of 10 independent votes. Two-dimensional image decomposition is performed using GALFIT to obtain structural parameters. Residual images are visually inspected to classify BP/X features into four categories: strong both-sided, both-sided, one-sided, and control (no BP/X). We also estimated stellar mass, distance, and physical size for each galaxy. Out of 6653 classified galaxies, we identified 1673 ($\\sim$25%) with both-sided BP/X features-504 ($\\sim$8%) strong and 1169 ($\\sim$17%) weak-as well as 1112 ($\\sim$17%) one-sided structures, making up a total of 2785 BP/X-hosting galaxies ($\\sim$42%). One-sided structures, likely signatures of ongoing buckling, are more frequent than strong both-sided bulges across all stellar masses. The fraction of BP/X bulges increases with stellar surface mass density, indicating a connection with bar formation in dense disks. We also find that galaxies with strong BP/X bulges contribute to increased scatter in the stellar mass-size and stellar mass-surface density relations, particularly at higher masses.",

Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and radial velocities, we infer the velocity field using information field theory on a 70 x 70 x 50 grid at 3 pc resolution. Our model suggests the existence of a primary stellar velocity field with a secondary field that accounts for an additional young kinematic component in Upper Scorpius and Lupus. We find clear tracers of a feedback-driven expansion of the association, while Galactic rotation appears to play a subordinate role. The results confirm the existence of cluster chains and reveal coherent large-scale expansion with characteristic speeds of 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ and local maxima of about 10 km s$^{-1}$. Power spectra indicate an excess of small-scale structure and slopes shallower than Kolmogorov, consistent with energy injection from stellar feedback. Maps of the divergence reveal net positive values, implying an approximate dispersal timescale of 10-15 Myr. A comparison with molecular gas in Lupus and Ophiuchus shows broadly consistent patterns but systematic velocity offsets of several km s$^{-1}$, suggesting partial decoupling for optically visible young stars and gas. The framework presented provides a physically motivated description of the Sco-Cen velocity field and a basis for quantifying the dynamical state and feedback history of OB associations in the local Galaxy.",

    "title": "Eclipse Mapping with Ariel: Future Prospects for a Population-Level Mapping Survey",
    "abstract": "Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our demographic understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.",

    "abstract": "The physical origin of prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question since it has been studied more than half a century. Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence, ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRBs. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its nondetected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\\Gamma=300$ and $\\varepsilon_{p} \\text{/} \\varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model. Moreover, we find that the fractions of the dissipative photosphere model, the internal shock model, and the ICMART model are constrained to be [0, $0.5\\%$], [0, $1.1\\%$], and [$98.9\\%$, 1], respectively, for the method of summing up the individual GRB contributions. For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\\%$], [0, $8.2\\%$], and [$91.8\\%$, 1], respectively. However, such fractions of different models are also dependent on the parameters of $\\Gamma$ and $\\varepsilon_{p} \\text{/} \\varepsilon_{e}$.",

Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \\sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \\ge 10^4 M_{\\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial \"structure\" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.",

This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.",

We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior.

    "abstract": "The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.",

We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.",

    "abstract": "Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.",

However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.",

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\\omega_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $\\omega_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.",

The force driving the process towards equilibrium is the corresponding out-of-balance Young's force. However, the speed with which the liquid front advances depends strongly on an opposing friction force arising from dissipative processes due to the moving solid-liquid-gas contact line. In analogy to the treatment of hydrodynamic friction we present an exact method, based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, to extract this friction from equilibrium data. We find that the contact line exhibits long-lasting memory with a characteristic power-law decay due to coupling to the systems hydrodynamic modes. Within linear response regime, we obtain the frequency-dependent dissipative and elastic response of the contact line to an external perturbation, including a frequency-dependent friction coefficient. Similar to hydrodynamic friction in liquids, we find that the friction decreases beyond a characteristic frequency and the system exhibits predominantly elastic behavior.",

    "abstract": "Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.",

These include interactions between a disk and a material point, between two disks, and between a disk and a wall. Each object is treated as a continuous medium of materials points interacting by the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. By integrating this potential in a pairwise manner, expressions for the potentials and resultant forces between extended objects are obtained. All the results are validated with numerical integrations. The analytical potentials are implemented in LAMMPS and used to simulate two-dimensional suspension of disks with an explicit solvent modeled as a Lennard-Jones liquid. In monodisperse disk suspensions, a disorder-to-order transition of disk packing is observed as the area fraction of disks is increased or as the solvent evaporates. In bidisperse disk suspensions being rapidly dried, stratification is found with the smaller disks enriched at the evaporation front. Such \"small-on-top\" stratification echoes the similar phenomenon occurring in three-dimensional polydisperse colloidal suspensions that undergo fast drying. These potentials can be applied to a wide range of two-dimensional systems involving disk-like objects.",

We show that the stationary vesicle length remains finite at the critical extension rate. The critical behaviour of the stationary vesicle length and of the growth rates of small perturbations is obtained analytically and confirmed by direct numerical computations.

    "abstract": "Understanding phase transitions requires not only identifying order parameters but also characterizing how their correlations behave across scales. By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $\\eta$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $\\eta$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.",

    "abstract": "Geometric frustration gives rise to emergent quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter. While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability. This work paves a pathway for scalable digital hardware that embeds physical symmetries to enable large scale simulations of material systems.",

In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\\,cm$^-1$ \\& 190\\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.",

Through comprehensive measurements of the transverse thermoelectric response as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we observe a pronounced Nernst signal near $T_c$ in the (111) oriented SrRuO$_3$ thin films. The strong temperature and nontrivial field dependence underscore the pivotal role of the magnetic anisotropy in tuning the Berry curvature and, consequently, the anomalous Nernst effect in SrRuO$_3$.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of solid-state batteries depends on the development of lithium-ion conductors that exhibit both high ionic conductivity and stability across a wide range of electrochemical and chemical conditions. In this paper, we investigate the chemical factors that control the stability of Li-NASICONs and garnets in highly alkaline aqueous environment. While this is of general importance, it is particularly important for the operation of Li-air cells with humidified air. Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte. In this work, we combine machine learning and first-principles calculations to conduct a high-throughput computational screening of alkaline-stable oxide-based Li-ion conductors in order to better characterize the tradeoff between the various relevant properties. We evaluate the material stability in terms of pH, voltage, and species present in the environment (LiOH and H2O) across a vast range of chemical compositions with NASICON and garnet crystal structures. We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications.",

Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.",

    "abstract": "Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \\emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \\emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.",

    "abstract": "As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.",

Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity.

As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau.

Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $\\kappa$ and $\\kappa_\\mathrm{L}/\\kappa$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$\\kappa$ candidates.

Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional layered materials (2DLM). Despite their small dimensions, 2DLM exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfigurations. In this review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in mono and bulk 2DLM, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the co-existence of multiple mechanisms and influence of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized 'atomristor'-type switching, we provide insights into the atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal-2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we present the progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices.

    "abstract": "Alpha-Formamidinium-tin-iodide (alpha-FASnI3) is a leading candidate for lead-free photovoltaic applications, adopting a nearly cubic structure at room temperature, but its stability remains limited by oxidation-driven degradation. Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair. Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, <111>-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell. These results define the essential ingredients for reliable modelling of alpha-FASnI3 and provide a rigorous foundation for studying lone-pair-driven physics in tin halide perovskites.",

In this study, an active learning (AL) framework was employed to identify HEC/MCC materials with a pyrochlore structure, with acceptable thermal conductivity (TC) for TBC applications. The AL framework was applied through a Bayesian optimisation (BO) strategy, coupled with a random forest surrogate model. TC was selected as the optimisation criterion as that is the most basic requirement of TBC materials. Over two iterations of the AL cycle, four compositions were generated and synthesized in the lab for experimental evaluation. The first iteration yielded two single-phase pyrochlores, $(La_{0.29}Nd_{0.36}Gd_{0.36})_2Zr_2O_7$ and $(La_{0.333}Nd_{0.26}Gd_{0.15}Ho_{0.15}Yb_{0.111})_2Zr_2O_7$, with measured thermal conductivities of 2.03 and 1.90 $W/mK$, respectively. The surrogate model predicted a TC of 2.009 $W/mK$ for both compositions, demonstrating it's accuracy for completely new compositions. The second iteration compositions showed dual-phase when synthesized, highlighting the need to take into account phase formation in the AL framework.",

    "title": "Discovery and recovery of crystalline materials with property-conditioned transformers",
    "abstract": "Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-{\\pi} (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-{\\pi} provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.",

However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (0.3 $\\leq x \\leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.",

    "abstract": "We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.",

If activity is localized in an annulus within the disk, the defect moves on a circular trajectory around the center of the disk.

Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.",

    "abstract": "Since more than 100 years, melting is thought to be governed by the Lindemann criterion. It assumes that a crystal melts when, upon heating, the growing atomic vibration amplitudes become sufficiently large to destabilize its crystalline lattice. However, it is unclear why the viscosities eta or the related relaxation times tau of the resulting liquids, measured directly at the melting point Tm, differ by up to nine decades, depending on the material. Based on the empirical rule that the ratio of the glass-transition temperature and Tm is about 2/3, here we show that this strong variation is due to differences in the liquid's fragilities, a property associated with pronounced non-Arrhenius behavior and often ascribed to cooperative motions. We propose that, without cooperativity, all crystals would melt into liquids with a universal viscosity value and relaxation time. Hence, the real melting point is only partly determined by the Lindemann criterion and strongly enhanced by the cooperativity of the resulting liquid. Our findings are corroborated by the determination of the idealized, fragility-free melting temperatures, and of the corresponding eta and tau values for various example materials.",

Therefore, controlling their nucleation and growth is key to advancing high-performance optoelectronic devices based on perovskite semiconductors. Millimeter-scale perovskite crystals can be synthesized as a continuous film through methylamine treatment, with nucleation sites directed by pre-patterned seeds. Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance.",

    "abstract": "Experiments have evidenced proton pairing in Y-doped BaZrO3. However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.",

Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall.

Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.",

The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics.

    "abstract": "We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential for the ${\\alpha}$-Fe-H system based on the tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP) formalism. Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the ${\\alpha}$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\\bar{2}]$-notched ${\\alpha}$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems.",

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.",

Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.",

Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.",

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.",

Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields.

    "abstract": "Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.",

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems.",

To validate this conjecture, we study topological chiral and nonreciprocal dynamics by encircling the exceptional points (EPs) of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in a trapped ion system. These dynamics are topologically robust against external perturbations even in the presence dissipation-induced nonadiabatic processes. Our findings indicate that they are protected by dynamical vorticity -- an emerging topological invariant associated with the energy dispersion of non-Hermitian band structures in a parallel transported eigenbasis. The symmetry breaking and other key features of topological dynamics are directly observed through quantum state tomography.

By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.",

The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to \"mechanical screening\" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.",

However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.",

The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $\\mu$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm.

Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.",

The momentum-energy representation $\\phi(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert.

The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.",

By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^{\\alpha}$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\\alpha$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\\alpha$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\\alpha=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\\alpha$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\\alpha=0$, we find that for small $\\alpha$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\\alpha=0$. At intermediate $\\alpha$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\\alpha$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\\tau$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\\alpha$ when $\\tau$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\\alpha$.

Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.",

    "abstract": "A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \\leq P < 1.8 \\mathrm{\\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \\mathrm{\\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.",

Our study reveals that $\\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\\Delta_{\\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\\lambda_{\\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\\Delta_{\\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material.

Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.",

Nevertheless, the system displays rich spatiotemporal flow patterns with pronounced small-scale intermittency. We uncover strongly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, a feature distinct from both bacterial and classical fluid turbulence. Furthermore, we observe power-law regimes in the kinetic energy spectra, characterized by unique scaling exponents. Not only do our results provide compelling evidence for active turbulence in systems devoid of nematic or polar structures, but they also challenge current theoretical models.

In such materials, the electrical resistivity has a strong linear dependence on temperature ($T$) and electrical current is not carried by electron quasiparticles as in conventional metals.

Our neutron scattering observations and the strange metal behaviour are consistent with a spin density wave quantum phase transition in a metal with spatial disorder in the tuning parameter. Numerical computations using a theory of spin density waves in a disordered metal yield an extended `Griffiths phase' with scaling properties in agreement with experimental observations. Thus we establish that low-energy spin excitations and spatial disorder are central to the strange metal behaviour.",

However, realistic modeling of CDWs-capturing effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the high computational cost of first-principles methods. Here, we develop a physically informed workflow for training machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on the E(3)-equivariant Allegro architecture, tailored to capture the subtle structural and dynamical signatures of CDWs in mono- and bilayer NbSe$_2$.We find that while CDW lattice distortions are relatively easy to learn, modeling vibrational properties remains more challenging. It requires targeted dataset design and careful hyperparameter tuning, pushing the boundaries and testing the extensibility of current MLIP frameworks. Our MLIPs enable reliable simulations of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, including their sensitivity to dimensionality and stacking, as well as CDW dynamics, phonons, and transition temperatures estimated via the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other two-dimensional systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.",

Moreover, the pressure dependence of the amplitudes of $M_1$($T$) and $M_2$($T$) indicates a continuous transfer of the volume fraction between the two SC phases.

In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1>2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1<2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\\mathbb{Z}_q\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases.

We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.",

According to this article, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies\".

Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable.

However, the potential for resistive heating and unregulated temperature increases due to domain wall conduction remains unexplored. Here, scanning thermal microscopy is employed to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure, and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of ~20 K at most, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate electrical conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from the filament-based heating typically observed in resistive switching oxides. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.",

We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.",

We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales.

    "title": "Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps",
    "abstract": "Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.",

    "abstract": "We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement cycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated fluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback strategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for such memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the potential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We show that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal baths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of bath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we introduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain the covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby exploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic analysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of positional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles. In particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains outperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay between bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding principles for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium environments.",

    "title": "Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model",
    "abstract": "Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.",

Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. A pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noise originating from field pulses. The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the change in the state of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has the potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since the MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE signals from various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, significantly extending the limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate material properties in pulsed fields.",

Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA).

In this work, we employ a phase-diagram-guided synthesis strategy to clarify the processing-structure-property relationships governing BiFeO$_3$ ceramics. Based on previous reports and our experimental observations, a refined Bi$_2$O$_3$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram was constructed identifing the onset of liquid-phase formation near 835$^\\circ$C in Bi-rich compositions. Solid-state synthesis using non-stoichiometric precursor ratios (55$\\colon$45 and 70$\\colon$30 Bi$_2$O$_3$ $\\colon$ Fe$_2$O$_3$) reveals that the 55$\\colon$45 composition sintered at 775$^\\circ$C favours phase-pure rhombohedral $R3c$ BiFeO$_3$ with suppressed sillenite- and mullite-type impurities, lattice contraction, and improved grain uniformity. These structural refinements result in near-Debye dielectric relaxation and a four-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in electrical conductivity relative to lower-temperature or Bi-rich conditions.

    "abstract": "Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.",

Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe$_2$ and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe$_2$, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.",

    "abstract": "Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom.",

We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure.",

    "abstract": "The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations",

We highlight universal aspects of the analogue field-theory approach. The first aim is to present an extended self-consistent construction of the analogue effective field-theory framework for data, which can be viewed as a maximum entropy model. In particular and exploiting universality arguments, we justify the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry of the classical action and we stress the existence of a large-scale (local) regime and of a small-scale (nonlocal) regime. Secondly and related to noise models, we observe the universal relation between phase transition and symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the detection threshold. Finally, we discuss the issue of defining the covariance matrix for tensorial-like data. Based on the cutting graph prescription, we note the superiority of definitions based on complete graphs of large size for data analysis.",

Our analytics allow us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\\langle c_i^\\dagger c_j \\rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\\langle c_{i_1}^\\dagger c^\\dagger_{i_2} \\cdots c_{i_n} \\rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.",

Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.",

This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.",

    "abstract": "Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.",

However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.",

Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics.

However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.",

The previous study demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.",

The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool.

A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \\textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}.

    "abstract": "A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.",

Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force.

Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.",

Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral.

When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.",

Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.",

We examine the structure of critical photon orbits and the corresponding optical appearance under spherical accretion. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we compute the quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, and explore their correspondence with the black hole shadows in the eikonal limit. A systematic parameter study demonstrates that the CoS intensity has the primary influence on the shadows, QNMs and GBFs, while the MCDF parameters introduce more complex but characterizable modifications to each. Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.",

The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\\sim 135^{\\circ} < \\phi < 270^{\\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.",

Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.",

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.",

While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Plebański--Demiański family.

Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics.

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.",

We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.",

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.",

Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.",

    "abstract": "We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ model (yielding $M_\\nu<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\\nu<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $o\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ and $M_\\nu<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\\nu$.

The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.",

    "abstract": "In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.",

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\\sigma$ to $2.3\\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.",

In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\\Omega_c \\approx 5\\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant.

Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\\ell,\\alpha)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\\ell$ and $\\alpha$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordström--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordström--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class.",

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.",

In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases.

Here, we discuss a recently developed numerical tool that, for the first time, implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We explain how it is used to find new solutions to that constraint and to show that some quantum geometric observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. We also point out that these new numerical methods can find applications in other domains.",

    "abstract": "The classical Penrose inequality, a relation between the ADM mass and the area of any cross section of the black hole event horizon, was introduced as a test of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture: if it fails, the trapped surface is not necessarily behind the event horizon and a naked singularity could form. Since that original derivation, a variety of proofs have developed, mainly focused on the initial data formulation on maximal spacelike slices of spacetime. Most of these proofs are applicable only for classical fields, as the energy conditions required are violated in the context of quantum field theory. In this work we provide two generalizations of the Penrose inequality for spherically symmetric spacetimes: a proof of a classical Penrose inequality using initial data and an average energy condition, and a proof of a modified Penrose inequality for evaporating black holes with a connection to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. The latter case could also be applicable to quantum fields as it uses a condition inspired by quantum energy inequalities. Finally, we provide physically motivated examples for both.",

We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.",

Once again, NFDG can successfully reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension $D\\left (R\\right)$, as with the nine other galaxies previously studied with these methods. In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model, which is capable of deriving the fractional mass dimension $D_{m}\\left(R \\right)$ from a single equation, as opposed to the previous $D\\left (R\\right)$, which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data for each galaxy.

After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.",

However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.",

We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly. The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.",

Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.",

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$; (ii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\\eta_0$ and $M_{\\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR.

We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales.

The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\\log T$ and $(1/2)\\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent.

On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state.

    "abstract": "Studies of strong interactions between hadrons provide a valuable opportunity to test Quantum Chromodynamics at nucleon-scale distances. The femtoscopy technique has proven to be an effective tool for studying interactions between unstable hadrons by measuring the correlation function of hadron pairs in momentum space. While several measurements of the strong interactions between light and strange hadrons have been conducted using this technique, studies of charm hadrons have been limited. These studies can shed light on the formation of exotic charm states or, in the case of baryons, nuclei with charm content. In these proceedings, measurements of the strong interaction between charm hadrons and light-flavor hadrons using the femtoscopy technique are presented. The final results on the correlation functions and residual strong interactions between $\\rm D$ mesons and light hadrons measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV are discussed. Additionally, new studies of correlations between $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$ and protons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, utilizing the new data samples collected from LHC Run 3, are presented.",

    "abstract": "The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.",

This study presents a 3D virtual laboratory developed using Unreal Engine 5 to support the High Voltage Engineering course for undergraduate students in Power Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Electromechanics. The research investigates how an immersive, gamified virtual laboratory enhances learning outcomes, safety training, and preparedness for urban infrastructure challenges. We hypothesize that VLab-HV significantly improves student engagement, knowledge retention, practical skills, and safety awareness compared to traditional laboratories, contributing to urban energy system resilience. Through ten curriculum-aligned experiments, gamified interactions, and AI-driven pedagogical tools, VLab-HV offers a risk-free environment for mastering HV concepts. Evaluation via usability testing, engagement metrics, and surveys confirms superior learning outcomes. The study highlights the role of VLab-HV in training engineers and professionals for urban energy challenges, with planned expansions for multiplayer and virtual reality integration.",

In the photophobic limit ($g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}=0$), ALPs couple to electroweak gauge bosons and are produced in association with two jets ($pp\\to jj a$) via both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector-boson-fusion (VBF)-like topologies, followed by $a\\to W^+W^-$ decay. We target the different-flavour dilepton mode $W^+W^-\\to e^\\pm\\mu^\\mp\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ with two jets and moderate missing transverse momentum. The analysis employs a two-step strategy: an initial preselection that defines the signal-like final state, followed by a multivariate analysis (MVA) trained on dijet and dileptonic-$WW$ kinematics from both the $s$-channel and VBF-like production mechanisms to separate signal from background; the MVA threshold is optimized independently at each $m_a$. We present $2\\sigma$ and $5\\sigma$ discovery sensitivities for the ALP-$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ across the $170$--$4000$ GeV mass range. For $260$ GeV $\\le m_a \\le 1500$ GeV, the $2\\sigma$ ($5\\sigma$) sensitivity is approximately flat around 0.61 (0.76) TeV$^{-1}$. We also report model-independent discovery thresholds for the fiducial quantity $\\sigma(pp\\to jj a)\\,\\mathrm{Br}(a\\to W^+W^-)$ over the same mass range to enable reinterpretation for other models. These results indicate that the $WWjj$ topology offers competitive and complementary sensitivity to heavy photophobic ALPs at the HL-LHC.",

    "abstract": "Exotic interactions between fermions mediated by new bosons beyond the Standard Model may hold the key to several fundamental conundrums on the frontier of this http URL , laboratory searching for exotic interactions on small length scales is fundamentally held back by the short force this http URL we propose that the force range of exotic interactions tends to infinity when the oscillation frequency of exotic interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, i.e., the new bosons become nearly on-shell. This is named as the near-threshold enhancement. Through the near-threshold enhancement, even fermions at distances larger than the original force range can make considerable contributions to exotic interactions. Therefore, the size of the experimental apparatus can break the limitation of the force range, and thus both the signal of exotic interactions and the sensitivity of sensors can be greatly enhanced. We also propose a method to search for the exotic interactions in the mass range between 80 $\\mu$eV and 800 $\\mu$eV taking advantage of the near-threshold enhancement. For the coupling $g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm e}g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm e}$, we expect an improvement on its upper bounds of 10 orders of magnitude at 800 $\\mu$eV. This method can be further extended to enhance the search for other types of exotic interactions and boost the study of new physics beyond the Standard Model.",

    "abstract": "The Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE) remains a compelling but enigmatic signal from the inner region of our galaxy. Muonphilic dark matter (DM), which couples exclusively to muons via a new mediator, provides a viable explanation for the GCE and relic density while naturally evading constraints from direct detection, collider searches and other multi-messenger observations. Based on the viable non-resonant parameter space identified in previous global fits, we perform a comprehensive study exploring the prospects for discovering such muonphilic DM in the context of a future $3$ TeV muon collider, focusing on simplified models with a $Z_2$-even mediator. Three distinct search strategies are investigated: visible on-shell mediator decays ($\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\gamma$ final state), invisible on-shell mediator decays (mono-photon plus missing energy), and mono-photon production via off-shell mediators. Through a detailed signal-background analysis using cut-and-count methods, we project the exclusion limits at $95\\%$ confidence level for seven representative models across a wide range of mediator masses. Our results demonstrate that the projected limits cover a significant portion of the viable parameter space that explains the GCE, establishing a muon collider as a decisive machine for testing the muonphilic DM hypothesis.",

First we update the analysis by applying the latest SNO+ constraints, that slightly shift the $(\\delta m^2,\\,\\sin^2\\theta_{12})$ best fits. Then we apply the constraints placed by the first JUNO results, that significantly reduce the uncertainties of both parameters. Our updated global bounds (as of 2025) can be summarized as: $\\delta m^2/10^{-5}{\\rm eV}^2 = 7.48\\pm 0.10$ and $\\sin^2\\theta_{12}=0.3085\\pm0.0073$ (with correlation $\\rho=-0.20$), corresponding to $1\\sigma$ uncertainties as small as $1.3\\%$ and $2.4\\%$, respectively.

This measurement utilizes data from 6.4$\\times10^{20}$ protons on target of exposure collected using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam with a mean neutrino energy of approximately 0.8~GeV. The mapping from reconstructed kinematics to truth quantities, particularly from reconstructed to true neutrino energy, is validated within uncertainties by comparing the distribution of reconstructed hadronic energy in data to that of the model prediction in different muon scattering angle bins after applying a conditional constraint from the muon momentum distribution in data. The success of this validation gives confidence that the missing energy in the MicroBooNE detector is well-modeled within uncertainties in simulation, enabling the unfolding to a three-dimensional measurement over muon momentum, muon scattering angle, and neutrino energy. The unfolded measurement covers an extensive phase space, providing a wealth of information useful for future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments measuring neutrino oscillations. Comparisons against a number of commonly used model predictions are included and their performance in different parts of the available phase-space is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\\gtrsim 7 \\times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\\approx 0.1 M_\\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \\times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\\langle \\phi_a \\rangle \\approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI).

In the present case we adopt a collinear configuration for the initial state, keeping transverse momentum effects only in the fragmentation mechanism. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. While not being a proof, due the assumptions and limitations behind the entire approach, these findings corroborate the hypothesis of TMD factorization for such processes as well as of the universality of the Collins function and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.",

After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.",

These techniques can be applied to other phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons to obtain the complete $\\mathcal O(\\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate, with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear radius. We find that $\\mathcal O(\\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level.

The additional term \\chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \\chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices.

One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities.

    "abstract": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.",

    "abstract": "Exotic interactions between fermions mediated by new bosons beyond the Standard Model may hold the key to several fundamental conundrums on the frontier of this http URL , laboratory searching for exotic interactions on small length scales is fundamentally held back by the short force this http URL we propose that the force range of exotic interactions tends to infinity when the oscillation frequency of exotic interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, i.e., the new bosons become nearly on-shell. This is named as the near-threshold enhancement. Through the near-threshold enhancement, even fermions at distances larger than the original force range can make considerable contributions to exotic interactions. Therefore, the size of the experimental apparatus can break the limitation of the force range, and thus both the signal of exotic interactions and the sensitivity of sensors can be greatly enhanced. We also propose a method to search for the exotic interactions in the mass range between 80 $\\mu$eV and 800 $\\mu$eV taking advantage of the near-threshold enhancement. For the coupling $g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm e}g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm e}$, we expect an improvement on its upper bounds of 10 orders of magnitude at 800 $\\mu$eV. This method can be further extended to enhance the search for other types of exotic interactions and boost the study of new physics beyond the Standard Model.",

    "abstract": "The Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE) remains a compelling but enigmatic signal from the inner region of our galaxy. Muonphilic dark matter (DM), which couples exclusively to muons via a new mediator, provides a viable explanation for the GCE and relic density while naturally evading constraints from direct detection, collider searches and other multi-messenger observations. Based on the viable non-resonant parameter space identified in previous global fits, we perform a comprehensive study exploring the prospects for discovering such muonphilic DM in the context of a future $3$ TeV muon collider, focusing on simplified models with a $Z_2$-even mediator. Three distinct search strategies are investigated: visible on-shell mediator decays ($\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\gamma$ final state), invisible on-shell mediator decays (mono-photon plus missing energy), and mono-photon production via off-shell mediators. Through a detailed signal-background analysis using cut-and-count methods, we project the exclusion limits at $95\\%$ confidence level for seven representative models across a wide range of mediator masses. Our results demonstrate that the projected limits cover a significant portion of the viable parameter space that explains the GCE, establishing a muon collider as a decisive machine for testing the muonphilic DM hypothesis.",

Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.",

    "abstract": "In the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, a residual symmetry known as lepton parity: $(-1)^L$, remains preserved. Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $\\sigma$ allows for the coupling $N S \\sigma$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\\rightarrow S\\sigma$), and (ii) for $T_{\\rm EW}<T_{\\rm rh}\\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $\\sigma-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $\\sigma-h$ coupling is small, then $\\sigma$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($\\sigma\\rightarrow S\\nu$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\\Delta{N}_{\\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $\\Delta{N}_{\\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.",

    "abstract": "We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ model (yielding $M_\\nu<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\\nu<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $o\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ and $M_\\nu<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\\nu$.

We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size.

The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal\" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.",

    "abstract": "The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\\Omega_c \\approx 5\\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.",

    "abstract": "We solve time-reversed stochastic inflation in the semi-infinite flat potential with a constant drift term and derive an exact expression for the probability distribution of the curvature fluctuations. It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae to look for evidence of axion emission affecting the rate of white dwarf cooling. If axions exist and couple to electrons, then axions could be produced at an appreciable rate in the electron-degenerate core of a white dwarf through axion bremsstrahlung from electrons. The emission of these axions would provide an additional cooling mechanism for white dwarfs that would affect the cooling rate, and hints of axions have been suggested based on observations of anomalous cooling reported for white dwarfs in the Galactic disc and halo. We performed stellar evolution simulations of white dwarf cooling that accounted for the additional energy loss due to axion bremsstrahlung from electrons, producing a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different values of the axion-electron coupling constant, as well as the white dwarf mass and envelope thickness. These cooling models are compared to observations of white dwarfs in 47 Tucanae from the Hubble Space Telescope through an unbinned likelihood analysis. The optimal model found by this analysis corresponds to the case of no axion emission with a thick white dwarf envelope, and we find a new bound on the axion-electron coupling of $g_{aee} \\leq 0.81 \\times 10^{-13}$ at 95% confidence level. This improves upon the previous white dwarf cooling bound for this coupling and excludes the range of values favoured by the axion hints from the anomalous cooling of Galactic white dwarfs.",

We undertake such a dual analysis for a class of two-component scalar dark matter models stabilized by $\\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ symmetries, specifically the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, $\\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ frameworks. Each model is tested against the latest observational data, including the Planck relic abundance and stringent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment. Simultaneously, we evaluate their theoretical integrity up to the GUT and Planck scales by enforcing vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity with one-loop Renormalization Group Equations. This combined approach reveals a rich and varied landscape of possibilities. We demonstrate that the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ model offers a broadly viable parameter space sustained by efficient semi-annihilation. In stark contrast, the $\\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ scenario is shown to be highly fine-tuned, with solutions confined to the Higgs resonance. Our most significant finding concerns the $\\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$ model: we show that an apparent conflict between experimental data and high-scale consistency is resolved when the model is viewed as an effective field theory, yielding a concrete prediction for new physics at or below the $10^6$ GeV scale.

In the present case we adopt a collinear configuration for the initial state, keeping transverse momentum effects only in the fragmentation mechanism. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. While not being a proof, due the assumptions and limitations behind the entire approach, these findings corroborate the hypothesis of TMD factorization for such processes as well as of the universality of the Collins function and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.",

After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.",

These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.",

The results indicate that the second-order scaled density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the phase coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment could be explained by the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.",

Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\\mu}(x)A{\\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, unless the integrated additional term \\chi=(g^2/16\\pi^2)\\int d^4xL(x) is not zero, these modified relations are not compatible with gauge invariance. The additional term \\chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \\chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When \\chi is zero, Q_a=3Q_t is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of Q_a is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when Q_t is stabilized around -1.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - \"Schwinger atoms\" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.",

Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.",

We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases.

    "abstract": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$; (ii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\\eta_0$ and $M_{\\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.",

This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation.

In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the naıve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections.

Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit.

To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures.

Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.",

In two dimensions, when the added operator has conformal weights $h=\\bar{h}=1$, conformal symmetry is not broken and the resulting theory is a distinct CFT. Studying such marginal operators for celestial CFTs allows for a geometric understanding of the space of allowed boundary theories dual to quantum field theories (QFT) in bulk asymptotically flat spacetimes. In traditional holographic examples, a marginal deformation on the boundary corresponds to a vacuum transition in the bulk theory. We affirm this in celestial CFTs which requires a general definition of marginal operators as composite celestial operators via pairs that live at distinct corners of celestial memory and Goldstone diamonds.",

Intriguingly, the vertices of this non-relativistic theory are less constrained than the ones of the original $4d$ chiral massless theory since we do not have enough dynamical generators to fix the couplings uniquely. Anticipating higher-spin interactions should be suppressed, we propose a simple approximate mass-spin relation which interpolates between the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. With the proposed mass-spin relation, we observe that that higher-spin interactions indeed become suppressed at large spins, consistent with low-energy physics. We conjecture that the holographic dual of the non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity proposed in this work is a $2d$ non-relativistic Landau-Ginzburg theory in the light-cone gauge. This non-relativistic theory is expected to describe a two-fluid system with a $\\lambda$-point constrained in one spatial dimension.",

    "abstract": "We study tensionless bosonic strings propagating in the presence of a constant Kalb-Ramond background and show how closed strings undergo a transition into open strings in this regime. The tensionless (Carrollian) limit induces a universal gluing between the worldsheet oscillators, which we generalize to include the effects of a constant $B$-field. We derive the modified mixed boundary conditions, construct the corresponding gluing matrix and obtain the generalized induced vacuum as a squeezed boundary state. This vacuum continuously emerges from the closed string vacuum through a Bogoliubov transformation, providing a precise realization of the closed-to-open string transition. We further extend the analysis to toroidal compactifications, and show that the mechanism of worldsheet Bose-Einstein condensation persists unaltered. In the second part of the paper, we give a unified symplectic derivation of the open string noncommutative parameter. We show that the boundary symplectic form alone determines the noncommutative geometry, and that in the tensionless limit the $B$-field term becomes the unique surviving contribution. Its inverse produces a noncommutative parameter similar to the Seiberg-Witten result, but arising intrinsically from the Carrollian worldsheet dynamics. Our results establish a coherent picture in which the emergence of open strings, boundary noncommutativity, and generalized vacuum structure all arise naturally from the worldsheet geometry of null strings in a $B$-field background.",

In this work, we extend the analysis to include the full tower of subleading corrections in the late-time and early-time expansion of the electric and magnetic waveforms, providing explicit expressions that depend only on the kinematic data and the electric and magnetic charges of the scattered objects. Using independent electric and magnetic potentials, we compute the full classical soft expansion for general dyonic scattering. We provide explicit, recursive expressions for the trajectory coefficients and the resulting electric and magnetic waveforms. The resulting soft expansion exhibits manifest covariance under the electric-magnetic duality. The electric and magnetic waveforms transform as an $SO(2)$ doublet under electric-magnetic duality. This provides a non-trivial consistency check on our formulation. For the specific case of two-body scattering, we obtain resummed expressions for the waveforms in both the time and frequency domains.",

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\\sigma$ to $2.3\\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.",

In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\\Omega_c \\approx 5\\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant.

Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\\ell,\\alpha)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\\ell$ and $\\alpha$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordström--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordström--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class.",

Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ model (yielding $M_\\nu<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\\nu<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $o\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ and $M_\\nu<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\\nu$.

    "abstract": "In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by \"coherent states.\" Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.",

    "abstract": "Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.",

When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.",

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.",

Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.",

    "abstract": "Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such \"impossible measurements\", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in \"impossible measurement\" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.",

The definition relies on constructing a canonical family of bounding cochains that satisfy the point-like condition of the second author and Tukachinsky. Since the Lagrangian is even dimensional, the parameter of the family is odd. Thus, to avoid the vanishing of invariants with more than one boundary constraint, the parameter must be non-commutative. The invariants are defined either when the Lagrangian is a rational cohomology sphere or when the Lagrangian is fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, has dimension $2$ modulo $4$, and its cohomology is that of a sphere aside from degree $1$ modulo $4$. In dimension $2$, these invariants recover Welschinger's invariants. We develop an obstruction theory for the existence and uniqueness of bounding cochains in a Fukaya $A_\\infty$ algebra with non-commutative coefficients. The obstruction classes belong to twisted cohomology groups of the Lagrangian instead of the de Rham cohomology of the commutative setting. A spectral sequence is constructed to compute the twisted cohomology groups. The extension of scalars of an $A_\\infty$ algebra by a non-commutative ring is treated in detail. A theory of pseudo-completeness is introduced to guarantee the convergence of the Maurer-Cartan equation, which defines bounding cochains, even though the non-commutative parameter is given zero filtration.",

For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\\,{=}\\,\\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection.

We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly. The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and the bosonic ghost-scale symmetries of a set of coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) combined field-theoretic system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories. We demonstrate that the Noether (anti-)BRST charges are non-nilpotent due to the presence of a set of non-trivial Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions on our theory. These CF-type restrictions are derived and discussed from different theoretical angles in our present endeavor. In addition to it, we obtain the nilpotent versions of the above (anti-)BRST charges from their counterparts non-nilpotent versions and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent charges to show that the physical states (existing in the total quantum Hilbert space of states) are those that are annihilated by the operator forms of the first-class constraints of our classical 4D combined field-theoretic system. The standard BRST algebra among the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and the bosonic ghost charge is derived, too.",

    "abstract": "Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the naıve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.",

In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\\log T$ and $(1/2)\\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.",

The mechanism relies on hidden fermionic symmetries of the worldline BRST formulation, rather than on standard BRST structure or physical supersymmetry. These symmetries localize the target-space trajectory. For the harmonic oscillator this yields an alternative localization derivation of the Jacobi-Poisson formula. Moreover, after the trajectory is localized, the remaining proper-time integral exhibits an emergent zero-dimensional supersymmetry generated by modular invariance, allowing the modulus T itself to be localized. For scalar QED the same structure provides a controlled computation of both the real and imaginary parts of the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. In particular, the imaginary part arises from a moduli space of circular worldline instantons, offering a localization perspective on the semiclassical exactness of the Schwinger pair-production result observed by Affleck-Alvarez-Manton.",

Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.",

Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\\mu}(x)A{\\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged.

The additional term \\chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \\chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices.

    "abstract": "A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schrödinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincaré algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.",

    "abstract": "Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.",

We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases.

    "abstract": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

In the present case we adopt a collinear configuration for the initial state, keeping transverse momentum effects only in the fragmentation mechanism. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. While not being a proof, due the assumptions and limitations behind the entire approach, these findings corroborate the hypothesis of TMD factorization for such processes as well as of the universality of the Collins function and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.",

The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schrödinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \\textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes.

These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.",

Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the anti-de Sitter geometry appears in the asymptotics of quantum invariants. In addition, based on the connection to conformal field theory, we reveal a correspondence between the edge lengths and the dihedral angles of truncated hyperideal anti-de Sitter tetrahedra and the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of hyperbolic four-holed spheres. We also provide a concrete instance of $3D/2D$ holography, in the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity numerical simulation serves as a cornerstone for exploring magnetization dynamics in micromagnetics. This work introduces a novel third-order temporally accurate and stable numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, aiming to address the limitations in accuracy and efficiency often encountered with conventional approaches. Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $\\alpha$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis. Salient distinctions between the proposed scheme and an existing third-order semi-implicit method include: (1) Solving the linear system associated with the existing scheme demands substantially greater computational time, underscoring the need for highly efficient solvers; (2) Although the proposed method shows increased sensitivity to damping parameters, it reliably converges to stable physical states and is effective in simulating magnetic domain wall motion, producing outcomes consistent with prior validated studies; (3) The energy levels computed by the proposed method are significantly lower than those obtained via the existing third-order scheme.",

    "abstract": "We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.",

We investigate the class AI$^†$ of complex symmetric random matrices, for which available analytic results remain scarce. Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class. This behavior is expected to be universal, as further supported by numerical evidence for Bernoulli random matrices.",

Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}.

By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings.

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.",

Treating the Richardson number as a small parameter and recasting the stability problem into an adjoint-residual form, we derive a first-order correction for the eigenvalues using only the neutrally buoyant eigenvalue problem. This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions.",

While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation.

To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds.

    "abstract": "We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241 . In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q<4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \\[ \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{\\lfloor nt \\rfloor}}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\frac{\\log(n)}{{2\\pi }\\sqrt{n}} \\mathcal{D}_{\\lfloor nt \\rfloor}\\right)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\stackrel{\\text{d}}{\\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}, \\] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275 , we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.",

    "abstract": "We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.",

In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent \"ghost\" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity.

We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly. The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.",

On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$.

We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality.

The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures.

Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.",

    "title": "Floquet thermalization by power-law induced permutation symmetry breaking",
    "abstract": "Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^{\\alpha}$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\\alpha$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\\alpha$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\\alpha=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\\alpha$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\\alpha=0$, we find that for small $\\alpha$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\\alpha=0$. At intermediate $\\alpha$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\\alpha$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\\tau$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\\alpha$ when $\\tau$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\\alpha$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.",

    "abstract": "We study the existence of polychromatic solutions of cubically nonlinear Maxwell equations in the whole space and with dispersive media, i.e., with a time delayed polarization. Due to the complex nature of the dielectric function, the frequencies are complex, resulting in a decay in time. The geometry is that of a waveguide in $x$ with the propagation direction being $y$ and the solutions are localized in $x$ and TM-polarized. These are often referred to as breathers. They are given as a Fourier series in $y$ and $t$ with the leading frequency $\\omega$ being an eigenvalue of a corresponding operator pencil on $\\mathbb{R}$ (in the $x$ variable). Each term in the series corresponds to a different temporal decay rate or a different frequency. The series is constructed iteratively via a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Our general result provides the existence under some assumptions on the spectrum and on estimates of the resolvent of the corresponding linear operator. We also produce an example of a waveguide given by the interface of two spatially homogeneous physically relevant media for which these assumptions are satisfied. For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons.",

    "abstract": "Inferring stochastic dynamics from data is central across the sciences, yet in many applications only unordered, non-sequential measurements are available-often restricted to limited regions of state space-so standard time-series methods do not apply. We introduce IDyNSD, a first-principles framework that identifies unknown dynamical parameters from such non-sequential data by minimizing Fokker-Planck residuals. We develop two complementary routes: a local route that handles region-restricted data via locally estimated scores, and a global route that fits dynamics from globally sampled data using a kernel Stein discrepancy without explicit density or score estimation. When the dynamics are affine in the unknown parameters, we prove a necessary-and-sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inferred parameters and derive a sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters are tightly constrained by the data and which remain effectively free under over-parameterization. For general non-affine case, both routes define differentiable losses amenable to gradient-based optimization. As demonstrations, we recover (i) the three parameters of a stochastic Lorenz system from non-sequential data (region-restricted data for the local route and full steady-state data for the global route) and (ii) a 3x7interaction matrix of a nonlinear gene-regulatory network derived from a published B-cell differentiation model, using only unordered steady-state samples and applying the global route. Finally, we show that the same Fokker-Planck residual viewpoint supports a \"dynamics-to-density\" complement that trains a normalized density estimator directly from known dynamics without any observations. Overall, IDyNSD provides two first-principles routes for system-identification from non-sequential data, grounded in the Fokker-Planck equation, that link data, density, and stochastic dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We use exponential asymptotic analysis to identify the relevance of Stokes' phenomenon to integrability in discrete systems. We study Stokes' phenomenon in two discrete problems with the same (leading-order) continuous limit, a finite-difference discretisation of the first continuous Painlevé equation and the first discrete Painlevé equation, as well as a family of differential equation associated with each discrete problem. This analysis reveals two important observations. Firstly, the orderly behaviour that characterises Stokes' phenomenon in discrete equations emerges naturally from corresponding continuous differential equations as the order of the latter increases, although this is not apparent at low orders. Secondly, Stokes' phenomenon vanishes in the continuum limit of the integrable discrete equation, but not the non-integrable discrete equation. This means that subdominant exponentials do not appear in the integrable equation, and therefore do not cause moveable singularities to form in the solution. The results are clarified further by consideration of one-parameter family of difference equations that interpolates between the two considered in detail.",

    "abstract": "We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting tsunami-like solitons with a rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductors. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schrödinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \\textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions originates from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multivalued Baker--Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \\textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider their classification.",

The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.",

Here, we report the first experimental observation of turbulence in a fundamentally different class of systems: dense monolayers of motile unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exhibit neither orientational order nor topological defects. Nevertheless, the system displays rich spatiotemporal flow patterns with pronounced small-scale intermittency. We uncover strongly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, a feature distinct from both bacterial and classical fluid turbulence. Furthermore, we observe power-law regimes in the kinetic energy spectra, characterized by unique scaling exponents. Not only do our results provide compelling evidence for active turbulence in systems devoid of nematic or polar structures, but they also challenge current theoretical models. Our work opens new avenues for understanding emergent dynamics in active-matter systems and suggests intriguing biological implications, including enhanced mixing and transport in dense cell suspensions.",

In heavy nuclei, this balance is expected to be achieved at lower energies than in protons, making lead-lead collisions at the LHC an ideal environment to probe the onset of saturation. The diffractive photoproduction of the $J/\\psi$ vector meson provides an excellent tool to study this regime since it directly probes the gluon distribution in the target. ALICE offers unique kinematic coverage of the photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy, spanning from 20 to 800 GeV, corresponding to three orders of magnitude in Bjorken-$x$ from about $10^{-2}$ down to $10^{-5}$. This contribution presents the latest ALICE results on the energy dependence of coherent $J/\\psi$ production, which is sensitive to the average gluon density, and on the energy and Mandelstam-$t$ dependence of incoherent production, which probes fluctuations of the gluon field at different spatial scales.

The hyperfine structures in two different atomic ground-state transitions at 398.4~nm and 398.2~nm were probed by in-source laser spectroscopy at the RISIKO mass separator in Mainz, using the PI-LIST high-resolution ion source. Experimental results were combined with hyperfine fields from various atomic ab-initio calculations, in particular using MultiConfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, as implemented in GRASP18. In this manner, the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments were derived to be $\\mu = -0.75(5)~ \\mu_\\textrm{N}$ and $Q_\\textrm{S} = +5.84(13)$~eb, respectively. The magnetic moment indicates occupation of the $\\nu$~7/2[613] Nilsson orbital, while the large quadrupole moment confirms strong, stable prolate deformation consistent with systematics in the heavy actinides. Comparisons with available expectation values from nuclear theory show good agreement, providing a stringent benchmark for the used theoretical models.

Detector R$\\&$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \\textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.",

The deuteron yield arising from the two-point baryon correlation is small compared to the leading-order contribution, which is attributed to the fact that in the regime of low collision energy, i.e., the region of large baryon chemical potential, the freeze-out curves deviate from the critical region, resulting in that the enhancement of the deuteron yield stemming from the critical fluctuations near the CEP is mild.",

These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\\beta$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation.

Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation.

In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.",

Before implementing the two methods, we analyze using Fourier series the linearized version of the equation by removing the nonlinear term $3(u^{2})_{xx}$, and found that a particular bound or condition needs to be satisfied to avoid blow-up solution. We found that high-frequency Fourier modes that do not satisfy the condition must be excluded from the Fourier solution. We then apply this condition to the numerical methods for solving the nonlinear Boussinesq equation and found that including only the Fourier modes that satisfy the condition gives stable solution with good accuracy. Including even just a few number of Fourier modes that violate the condition result in a blow-up solution. The accuracy of the method is measured by computing the $L^{\\infty}$ error against a soliton exact solution.

Unlike particle-based dark matter models, hodons are kinematically inert and possess ultra-light effective mass derived from vacuum energy density and holographic volume bounds. We introduce a covariant scalar field $\\mathcal{N}(x^\\mu)$ representing local hodon density and derive an entropy-driven evolution equation consistent with causal structure and general relativity. The resulting stress-energy contribution from hodon fluctuations yields gravitational clumpiness without invoking new particles or modified gravity. A virial-based toy model demonstrates that baryonic matter surrounded by hodons forms stable, cored halo profiles, consistent with galactic rotation curves and low-mass halo observations. The framework naturally suppresses small-scale structure via spatial uncertainty relations, aligning with constraints from the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and weak lensing. By integrating Bousso's covariant entropy bound and distinguishing between strong and weak holography, we situate the model within a broader epistemological context. These results suggest that dark sector phenomenology may emerge from the statistical geometry of space itself, offering a falsifiable alternative to particle dark matter.",

    "abstract": "China, the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) market, plays a pivotal role in global transport decarbonization. We present the first high-resolution assessment of EV low-carbon development across 295 cities, using over 20 million registrations of 586 models from 2022-2024, and projects transition pathways to 2035. Real-world data reveal that EVs are 30.9212.8 megajoules per 100 kilometers more energy-efficient than internal combustion vehicles, yet carbon intensity varies widely-from 18.2 to 270.4 gCO2/kilometer across provinces. Despite rapid electrification, gasoline still accounts for 44% of EV energy use, underscoring the limited electrification of hybrids. Scenario projections suggest emissions will peak around 2030 at 21.1-30.9 MtCO2, declining by 2035 with solid-state battery deployment and stronger policies. These findings establish an empirical foundation for accurate emission accounting, emphasize the need to reduce regional disparities, and offer globally relevant insights to accelerate deep-decarbonization in transport.",

    "abstract": "Force transmission at large length scales is crucial for such biological functions as cell motility and morphogenesis. The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to \"mechanical screening\" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how charge-carrier mobility evolves as high-purity germanium (HPGe) is thinned from bulk to micrometer scale is essential for optimizing advanced radiation detectors, thin-body Ge electronics, and emerging quantum devices. We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $\\mu(t) = \\mu_0 \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\big( - (t/\\tau)^{\\beta} \\big) \\right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $\\tau = 6$--$50~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $\\lambda_D < \\tau \\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \\gtrsim 3\\tau$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies.",

By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart. This work introduces a general framework for nonreciprocal negative refraction across frequency regimes, expanding the design space of time-varying metasurfaces and photonic time crystals.",

    "abstract": "Lithium diffusion in solid-state battery anodes occurs through thermally activated hops between metastable sites often separated by large energy barriers, making such events rare on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) timescales. Here, we present a bottom-up multiscale workflow that integrates AIMD, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to establish a quantitatively consistent link between atomistic hopping mechanisms and mesoscale transport. MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, from these long MLFF trajectories, we obtain statistically converged lithium jump networks and construct MSMs that remain Markovian across more than two orders of magnitude in the lag times used for their construction. The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways. Although demonstrated for defect-free crystalline Li$_x$Si$_y$ phases, the AIMD$\\rightarrow$MLFF$\\rightarrow$MSM framework is general and provides a transferable approach for describing lithium transport in amorphous materials, defect-mediated diffusion, and next-generation solid-state anodes.",

While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.",

We report a detailed study of impurity distribution in a single Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal produced at University of South Dakota (USD). The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions. These findings inform process-optimization strategies for HPGe crystal pulling, improve impurity control along the boule, and support the reliable fabrication of large, low-background HPGe detectors for next-generation rare-event searches.",

We find that while the emulator realistically captures internal atmospheric variability, it produces a significantly amplified forced teleconnection response to ENSO. This amplified response leads to biases in simulating extremes, notably an overestimation of atmospheric blocking frequency and duration with the underestimation of peak intensity. Our findings underscore that coupled DL climate models require in-depth and physically-grounded validation, analogous to traditional numerical models, to build confidence in their use for physical climate analysis.",

The hyperfine structures in two different atomic ground-state transitions at 398.4~nm and 398.2~nm were probed by in-source laser spectroscopy at the RISIKO mass separator in Mainz, using the PI-LIST high-resolution ion source. Experimental results were combined with hyperfine fields from various atomic ab-initio calculations, in particular using MultiConfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, as implemented in GRASP18. In this manner, the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments were derived to be $\\mu = -0.75(5)~ \\mu_\\textrm{N}$ and $Q_\\textrm{S} = +5.84(13)$~eb, respectively. The magnetic moment indicates occupation of the $\\nu$~7/2[613] Nilsson orbital, while the large quadrupole moment confirms strong, stable prolate deformation consistent with systematics in the heavy actinides. Comparisons with available expectation values from nuclear theory show good agreement, providing a stringent benchmark for the used theoretical models.

    "abstract": "Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of premixed hydrogen-air flames anchored in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) are performed at a friction Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=530$ and thermochemical conditions susceptible to the emergence of intrinsic thermo-diffusive (TD) phenomena acting on the turbulent flame. Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it. The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena. At $\\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \\sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed.",

    "abstract": "Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($\\mu$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $\\mu$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $\\mu$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $\\mu$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $\\mu$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude, making $\\mu$CF an attractive intense neutron source. We show an example $\\mu$CF system with a modest muon rate of $10^8$ muons / second could produce up to 0.5 mg of $^{225}$Ac per year - ten times current global supply - with a 10 gram $^{226}$Ra feedstock. As higher muon rate beams become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $\\mu$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production before net energy generation is possible.",

    "title": "Crowdsourcing the Frontier: Advancing Hybrid Physics-ML Climate Simulation via $50,000 Kaggle Competition",
    "abstract": "Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.",

In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging system assembly knowledge can be expanded by leveraging open-source hardware and software, simplified installation requirements, and collaborative training initiatives. To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction. The constructed scanner represents a valuable platform for educational initiatives, pulse sequence development, and preclinical research imaging efforts.",

Using techniques from averaging theory of dynamical systems, a reliable accelerated model based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) approach for a common fiber laser amplifier application is derived. Computational testing reveals that this accelerated model achieves an ${\\sim}4000$x increase in computational speed compared to the CMT model while preserving a high accuracy in key figures-of-merit such as output power and amplification efficiency. Further, we argue that by adopting our recommended approximations within the reduced model framework enables the model to be applied a wider set of amplifier types and configurations than can the current (comparable) reduced models found in the literature.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive validation, performance characterization, and scalability analysis of a hardware-accelerated phase-averaged multiscale solver designed to simulate acoustically driven dilute bubbly suspensions. The carrier fluid is modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The dispersed phase is represented through two distinct subgrid formulations: a volume-averaged model that explicitly treats discrete bubbles within a Lagrangian framework, and an ensemble-averaged model that statistically represents the bubble population through a discretized distribution of bubble sizes. For both models, the bubble dynamics are modeled via the Keller--Miksis equation. For the GPU cases, we use OpenACC directives to offload computation to the GPUs. The volume-averaged model is validated against the analytical Keller-Miksis solution and experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement with root-mean-squared errors of less than 8% for both single-bubble oscillation and collapse scenarios. The ensemble-averaged model is validated by comparing it to volume-averaged simulations. On an NCSA Delta node with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we observe a speedup 16-fold compared to a 64-core AMD Milan CPU. The ensemble-averaged model offers additional reductions in computational cost by solving a single set of averaged equations, rather than multiple stochastic realizations. However, the volume-averaged model enables the interrogation of individual bubble dynamics, rather than the averaged statistics of the bubble dynamics. Weak and strong scaling tests demonstrate good scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. These results show the proposed method is robust, accurate, and efficient for the multiscale simulation of acoustically driven dilute bubbly flows.",

Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.",

    "abstract": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable.",

For policymakers in international development, a critical challenge is identifying \"leverage points\" - specific goals where limited resource allocation yields the maximum system-wide benefit. This study addresses this challenge by modeling the SDGs as a Networked Dynamical System (NDS). Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.",

By moving the two synchronous oppositely circularly polarized XUV pulses (that make the ionizing LP pulse) apart in time, we propose an attosecond double-slit streak camera scheme to see information loss in polarization-dependent two-slit phenomena. Such streaking interferogram is then composed of several Feynman's thought experiments in time domain, in which electrons are affected by the IR pulse as they exit the two attoslits upon XUV ionization processes to form Archimedean spiral patterns. As a proof-of-principle, when the IR femtofield and first XUV attopulse are synchronous, a loss of contrast through dephasing is seen in the simulated momentum and energy distributions of the photoelectron. It is shown that the contrast between bright and dark interference fringes diminishes predominantly along the IR-field polarization axis and is sensitive to the IR-field waveform.

However, the practical applications of TFCs have been hindered thus far by the need for cryogenic cooling, limited bandwidth, and bulky configuration, largely due to the lack of advanced THz sources. Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit coupling in exciton-polariton condensates governs spinor interactions among quasi-particles and shapes the emergence of topological excitations, such as vortices, solitons, and strings. Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.",

It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data.",

    "abstract": "We present a perturbation-based framework that captures buoyancy effects on modal instabilities in stratified boundary-layer flows within the fully compressible, non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq formulation. Treating the Richardson number as a small parameter and recasting the stability problem into an adjoint-residual form, we derive a first-order correction for the eigenvalues using only the neutrally buoyant eigenvalue problem. This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions.",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have become a cornerstone of flat-optics, enabling precise control over light propagation through nanoengineered materials. Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 {\\mu}m. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 {\\mu}m to 200 {\\mu}m, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability.",

    "abstract": "The reported ''dissociation times'' for the Br$_{2}$ C ($^{1}\\Pi_{u}$ $1_{u}$) state by various measurement methods differ widely across the literature (30 to 340 fs). We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\\pm$ 1 and 20 $\\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.",

Based on a dune-crater size ratio and a modified Stokes number, we propose a map that classifies the different outcomes of interactions. If used with caution, the map can serve as a reference for understanding the much slower behavior of dunes migrating over or near craters on the surface of Mars.",

In this study, we demonstrate a monolithic Z-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) microring platform that enables simultaneous generation of tunable multi-chromatic microlasers and Raman-assisted soliton microcombs. Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum. Under continuous-wave laser pumping at 3.73 mW in the telecom band, we achieved a Raman-assisted soliton comb centered at 1624.49 nm with record-low pump threshold on the LNOI platform. Concurrently, multi-chromatic Raman lasing outputs were observed at ~1700, ~813, and ~535 nm within the same microring. The system exhibited efficient wavelength tuning of these multi-chromatic laser signals through a 5 nm shift in pump wavelength.

    "abstract": "Wind turbines operating within wind farms experience complex aerodynamic loading arising from the interplay between wake-induced velocity deficits, enhanced turbulence, and varying operational conditions. Understanding the relationship between the blade's structural response to the different operating regimes and flow structures generated in the turbine's wake is critical for predicting fatigue damage and optimizing turbine performance. In this work, we implement a novel technique, allowing us to simultaneously measure spatially distributed blade strain and wake dynamics for a model wind turbine under controlled free-stream turbulence (FST) and tip-speed ratio ($\\lambda$) conditions. A $1$ $\\mathrm{m}$ diameter three-bladed rotor was instrumented with distributed Rayleigh backscattering fibre-optic sensors, while synchronised hot-wire anemometry captured wake evolution up to $4$ rotor diameters downstream. Experiments were conducted covering a wide $\\{\\mathrm{FST}, \\lambda\\}$ parameter space -- $21$ cases in total. Results reveal that aerodynamic-induced strain fluctuations peak at $\\lambda \\approx 3.5$, close to the design tip -speed ratio ($\\lambda_d = 4$), with the blade's tip experiencing a contribution from the aerodynamically-driven strain fluctuations of up to $75\\%$ of the total fluctuating strain at design conditions. Spectral analysis shows frequency-selective coupling between wake flow structures and the blade response, dominated by flow structures dynamically related to the rotor's rotating frequency (\\textit{eg.} tip vortex structure). The novel experimental methodology and results establish a data-driven foundation for future aeroelastic models' validation, and fatigue-informed control strategies.",

This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy. As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.",

However, existing DUV microscopes typically rely on specialized optics and DUV-sensitive cameras, which restrict field of view, increase system complexity and cost, and often require high illumination doses that risk photodamage. Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at {\\lambda} = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells.

We present the first experimental results using a 226.9 MeV synchrotron-proton beam impinging on a homogeneous phantom at a sub-clinical intensity (2 - 4 x 10^7 pps). SER-PGT uses data from a multi-detector setup: a thin and segmented Low Gain Avalanche Diode for proton detection and Lanthanum Bromide-based crystals for photon detection. The estimated stopping power profile showed an 8% +- 3% average error compared to NIST PSTAR values, and 2% +- 2% deviation relative to water at 100 MeV. Range assessment in a phantom with a 4 cm air-gap successfully identified the range shift with a 3 mm standard deviation.

    "title": "Design of a Plastic Inorganic Semiconductor GaPS4-Based Gas Sensor for Conformal Monitoring of Gas Lines",
    "abstract": "This paper reports the first gas sensor based on the plastic inorganic semiconductor GaPS4, pioneering the application of plastic inorganic semiconductors in the field of gas sensing. Unlike traditional rigid sensors, this device leverages the unique layered structure and ultra-wide bandgap of GaPS4 to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting NO2. The intrinsic plastic deformability of the material enables it to conform tightly to complex curved pipelines like an \"electronic bandage,\" completely eliminating monitoring blind spots. Nanoindentation tests reveal that its extremely low hardness (0.20 GPa) confers exceptional flexibility while maintaining stable electrical characteristics even under bent states. The device exhibits a linear response to NO2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppm at room temperature. Although the limited defects in the single-crystal material result in pA-level response currents, defect engineering offers a viable pathway for performance enhancement. This study breaks through the conventional boundaries of plastic inorganic semiconductors confined to photoelectric and thermoelectric applications, opening new avenues for their use in gas sensing and advancing gas monitoring technology toward \"conformal integration.\"",

    "title": "An octree-based sampling algorithm for analyzing big simulation data",
    "abstract": "As computational resources continue to increase, the storage and analysis of vast amounts of data will inevitably become a bottleneck in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and related fields. Although compression algorithms and efficient data formats can mitigate this issue, they are often insufficient when post-processing large amounts of volume data. Processing such data may require additional high-performance software and resources, or it may restrict the analysis to shorter time series or smaller regions of interest. The present work proposes an improved version of the existing \\emph{Sparse Spatial Sampling} algorithm ($S^3$) to reduce the data from time-dependent flow simulations. The $S^3$ algorithm iteratively generates a time-invariant octree grid based on a user-defined metric, efficiently down-sampling the data while aiming to preserve as much of the metric as possible. Using the sampled grid allows for more efficient post-processing and enables memory-intensive tasks, such as computing the modal decomposition of flow snapshots. The enhanced version of $S^3$ is tested and evaluated on the scale-resolving simulations of the flow past a tandem configuration of airfoils in the transonic regime, the incompressible turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, and the flow around an aircraft half-model at high Reynolds and Mach numbers. $S^3$ significantly reduces the number of mesh cells by $35 \\%$ to $98\\%$ for all test cases while accurately preserving the dominant flow dynamics, enabling post-processing of CFD data on a local workstation rather than HPC resources for many cases.",

In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains. Moreover, we managed to find a close connection between the dual series relations method and the generalized method of separation of variables.",

However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.",

Conventional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced models are attractive because of their optimality and low online cost; however, but they perform poorly when snapshots contain parameter-dependent discontinuities, leading to smeared shocks, stair-stepping, or non-physical oscillations. In $\\texttt{CRLS}$, we first map each full-order snapshot to a smoother representation by applying a one-dimensional Gaussian convolution with reflect padding along the flow field coordinates. The convolution hyperparameters (kernel width and support) are selected automatically by Bayesian optimization on a held-out set of snapshots. POD bases are then extracted from the smoothed data, and the parametric dependence of the POD coefficients is learned via radial basis function interpolation. To recover sharp shock structures, we introduce an efficient deconvolution step formulated as a regularized least squares problem, where the regularization centers the reconstruction around a nearest-neighbor reference snapshot in parameter space. The resulting $\\texttt{CRLS}$ surrogate is evaluated on inviscid transonic flow over the RAE2822 airfoil, modeled by the steady compressible Euler equations solved with SU2 over a Latin hypercube sample of Mach number and angle of attack. Compared with standard POD and smoothed-POD baselines, $\\texttt{CRLS}$ yields markedly improved shock location and strength, lower surface-pressure and field-level errors, and a $42$\\% reduction in the number of POD modes required to capture a fixed fraction of snapshot energy. These results demonstrate that $\\texttt{CRLS}$ provides an accurate, data-efficient, and largely automated route to shock-aware reduced order models for high-speed aerodynamic design.",

    "abstract": "Quantum physics education at the upper-secondary level traditionally follows a historical approach, rarely extending beyond early 20th-century ideas, leaving students unprepared for comprehending modern quantum technologies central to everyday life and many facets of modern industry. To address this gap, we investigated how upper-secondary students and pre-service teachers understand quantum teleportation when taught with a simplified diagrammatic formalism based on the ZX-calculus, which represents quantum processes as diagrams of wires and boxes. Through phenomenographic analysis of video-recorded group work sessions, written responses to exercises, and a group interview, with a total of n=21 participants, we identified an outcome space consisting of four qualitatively different, hierarchically ordered categories of description encapsulating the different ways of experiencing quantum teleportation. The categories revealed that a conceptual progression depends on how one understands the temporality in quantum processes, the role of entanglement in quantum teleportation, the active nature of quantum measurements, and interpretations of mathematical operations in the diagrams. Our findings demonstrate that while a simplified diagrammatic formalism for teaching quantum physics provides an accessible entry point at the upper-secondary level, it does not automatically resolve fundamental conceptual challenges, and requires careful consideration in terms of developing teaching and learning sequences. Finally, these results provide educators with a deeper understanding of conceptual affordances and challenges for designing and improving instruction, whilst also highlighting the need for further exploring how students and teachers alike understand quantum phenomena.",

This decline is even more notable among Black, Indigenous, and people of colour (BIPOC) women and gender diverse physicists, whose representation drops by almost 60%. Several programs from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) have been implemented in order to improve equity, diversity, and accessibility in STEM on a national level, most notably the Chairs for Women in Sciences and Engineering (CSWE) and Chairs for Inclusion in Sciences and Engineering (CISE) initiatives.

    "title": "Vibrational Transportation of Deformable Axisymmetric Particles",
    "abstract": "A particle on a substrate supporting a surface acoustic wave can experience horizontal drift excited by the dry friction force. The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions.",

This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts.",

    "abstract": "Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper by Aziz and Howl (Nature 2025) argues that, once quantum matter is described at the level of quantum field theory and coupled to a classical gravitational field, higher order processes can generate entanglement between two spatially separated masses. A contemporaneous critical note (Marletto, Oppenheim, Vedral, Wilson, arXiv:2511.07348v1 ) shows that, in the actual nonrelativistic limit employed there, the interaction becomes ultra local, the total unitary factorizes, and no entanglement is generated from a product input. In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field. Once these clarifications are in place, the standard BMV inference that observation of gravity mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains intact.",

Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.",

In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.",

By analysing the Helfrich bending energy and viscous flow stresses in the limit of highly elongated shapes, we demonstrate that all stationary vesicle configurations are metastable. For vesicles with small reduced volume, we identify the type of bifurcation at which the stationary state is lost, leading to unbounded vesicle elongation in time. We show that the stationary vesicle length remains finite at the critical extension rate. The critical behaviour of the stationary vesicle length and of the growth rates of small perturbations is obtained analytically and confirmed by direct numerical computations. The beginning stage of the unbounded elongation dynamics is simulated numerically, in agreement with the analytical predictions.",

Additional relative permittivity values in (110) and (011) orientations of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 were computed by using first-principles calculation methods for accurate apparent charge density (ND-NA) extraction and breakdown electric field analysis from capacitance-voltage measurements. The HJDs fabricated on n+ (110) exhibited breakdown electric fields >10 MV/cm up to 12.9 MV/cm, showing the highest experimentally observed parallel-plane junction electric field among \\b{eta}-Ga2O3-based junctions. Breakdown electric fields among (100), (010), (001), and (011) orientations showed distinct distribution in the range of 5.13-5.26 MV/cm, 5.10-7.05 MV/cm, 2.70-3.33 MV/cm, and 3.88-4.38 MV/cm, respectively, validating the orientational dependence of parallel-plane junction electric field at breakdown in low-symmetry monoclinic \\b{eta}-Ga2O3. The parallel-plane breakdown electric fields (EBr,||) reported in this work were extracted when the device experienced catastrophic breakdown at 100 mA/cm^2 current density compliance, and should not be confused with critical electric field (Ec) as a function of drift layer doping concentration, which accounts for electric-field dependent impact ionization coefficients in Si, SiC and GaN. This study can guide the choice of crystal orientation for high performance gallium oxide-based devices that require high electric field handling capability.",

We demonstrate that the extensional viscosity growth function is determined by the instantaneous gyration radii in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the extensional direction and their time derivatives. Our approach also provides a unified description of the steady-state extensional viscosity of dilute polymer solutions for various chain lengths and concentrations in terms of the polymer gyration radius.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic rays (CRs) streaming in weakly magnetized plasmas can drive large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations via nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI), or Bell instability. Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel p-adaptive, high-order mesh-free framework for the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid flows in complex geometries. High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability.",

Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.",

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole.

    "abstract": "We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "Over the last four decades, the way knowledge is created in academia has transformed dramatically: research teams have grown larger, scholars draw from ever-wider pools of prior work, and the most influential discoveries increasingly emerge from complex collaborative efforts. Using a massive dataset of over 15 million publications spanning 1970-2010 and covering six major domains (Humanities, Social Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and Technology, and Natural Sciences), this study tracks how three core features of scientific papers - authorship team size, the breadth and variety of cited sources, and eventual citation impact - have co-evolved over time. We uncover striking differences across disciplines. In every field, papers that build on a broader and more diverse knowledge base consistently attract more citations later on, lending large-scale empirical support to theories that view scientific breakthroughs as outcomes of novel recombination across distant ideas. Bigger teams, on average, generate work with greater ultimate influence, but the gains taper off after a certain scale; very large consortia seldom produce the absolute highest-impact papers. While the Humanities and Social Sciences remain anchored in solo or small-group authorship traditions, the Natural Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering have moved decisively toward big-team mega-science. These patterns illuminate the underlying production technology of discovery, reveal discipline-specific barriers to collaboration and idea integration, and offer evidence-based guidance for research funding agencies, universities, and policymakers seeking to organize scientific work for maximum breakthrough potential.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.

While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.",

    "abstract": "Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.",

Such recurrence relations are very common in the quantitative sciences, and describe finite difference schemes, solutions to problems in Markov processes and quantum mechanics, and coefficients in the series expansion of Heun functions and other higher-order functions. Our solution avoids the usage of continued fractions and relies on a linear algebraic approach that makes use of the properties of lower-triangular and tridiagonal matrices, allowing one to express the terms in the recurrence relation in closed-form in terms of a finite set of orthogonal polynomials. We pay particular focus to the power series coefficients of Heun functions, which are often found as solutions in eigenfunction problems in quantum mechanics and general relativity and have also been found to describe time-dependent dynamics in both biology and economics. Finally, we apply our results to find equations describing the relaxation times to steady state behaviour in social choice models.",

    "abstract": "Column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budgets underpin theories of tropical convection and circulation, yet in reanalyses and climate models the budget rarely closes; residuals routinely match the leading terms and mask physical insights. This study derives an MSE conservation law that is strictly consistent with GISS ModelE3 and elucidates why conventional diagnostics fail. Multiple intertwined factors -- the breakdown of the product rule upon discretization, effects of mass-filtering, mismatched flux and advective forms, numerical noise in diagnosed vertical velocity, asynchronous model output timing, and postprocessing including vertical interpolation and temporal averaging -- leave significant residuals in both annual means and daily variability, even when raw 30-min model output is used. Residuals are even larger over land and along coastlines. To tackle this obstacle, this study implements the \"process increment method,\" which accurately computes the column MSE flux divergence by calculating the change in column-integrated internal energy, geopotential energy, and latent heats before and after applying the dynamics scheme. Furthermore, the calculated column flux divergence is decomposed into horizontal and vertical advective components. The most crucial finding is that vertical interpolation into pressure coordinates can introduce errors substantial enough to reverse the sign of vertical MSE advection in the warm-pool regions. In ModelE3, native-grid values show MSE import via vertical circulations, while values after interpolation into pressure coordinates indicate export. This discrepancy may prompt a reevaluation of vertical advection as an exporting mechanism and underscores the importance of precise MSE budget calculations.",

Applied to droplet impingement experiments, our method yields highly resolved and physically consistent 3D interface and flow dynamics.

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.",

A quasi-continuum band of bound shear mechanical modes inside the suspended microdisk are revealed for the first time, allowing feasible phase matching of stimulated Brillouin lasing (SBL). We achieve efficient cross-polarized optomechanical coupling and SBL via the significant photoelastic tensors of lithium niobate (e.g., p41=-1.51). This approach yields a 118 Hz intrinsic linewidth and a comparatively low threshold power of 3.15 mW. A real-time electro-optic tuning of the cross-polarized Brillouin scheme with a tuning efficiency of ~93.1 kHz/V is also achieved, further showcasing potential of LNOI platform for next-generation tunable photonic systems.",

The optimization can be particularly difficult if the excitation involves significant rearrangement of the electron density, as for charge transfer excitations. A simple strategy for variational orbital optimization of excited states is presented. The approach involves minimizing the energy while freezing the orbitals directly involved in the excitation, followed by a fully unconstrained saddle point optimization. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy are carried out using direct optimization algorithms with the same computational scaling as ground state calculations. The performance of the method is extensively assessed in calculations of intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer excited states of organic molecules and molecular dimers using a generalized gradient approximation functional. It is found that the freeze-and-release direct optimization approach can avoid variational collapse to spurious, charge-delocalized solutions for cases where conventional algorithms based on the maximum overlap method fail. For intermolecular charge transfer, the orbital-optimized calculations are found to provide the correct dependency of the energy on the donor-acceptor separation without requiring long-range exact exchange, something common time-dependent density functional theory approaches fail to achieve.",

While extensively studied in parity-time ($\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$)-symmetric systems and under Markovian dynamics, their exploration in broader pseudo-Hermitian settings particularly those involving non-Markovian environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate a pseudo-Hermitian system consisting of three coupled optical cavities interacting with non-Markovian environments. Compared to the Markovian baseline, we demonstrate that the emergence of non-Markovian memory effects enlarges the dimensionality of the parameter space of the system, thereby giving rise to higher-order EPs. Moreover, we observe that the pseudo-Hermitian system with an effective gain induced by coherent perfect absorption enables the higher-order EPs to be directly read out from the output spectrum. Additionally, we find that breaking the symmetry of the parameter space of the system reduces the order of the EPs. Possible experimental implementations based on a superconducting circuit are also discussed. Our findings reveal how non-Markovianity enhances the sensitivity of the system and provide a theoretical insight into the experimental observation of higher-order EPs.",

Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.",

We implement sine-cosine phase representation with Euclidean normalization as a non-trainable layer within the network, enabling the model to account for the periodic nature of phase while enforcing the mathematical constraint $\\sin^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\phi = 1$. A Euclidean distance-based loss function in the sine-cosine space ensures a physically meaningful error metric while preventing discontinuity issues. The model achieves good, consistent performance (e.g., coefficient of determinations above 0.9) with small, imbalanced datasets of 580 and 1075 data points, compared to several thousand typically required by alternative approaches.

    "abstract": "Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the robustness of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a bilayer dielectric rod array against geometric and material perturbations. Our analysis focuses on both symmetry-protected and Fabry-Pérot BICs, examining their transformation into quasi-BICs under three structural modifications: (i) in-plane displacement of one layer, which breaks the C$_2$ symmetry of the system; (ii) introduction of material losses that break time-reversal symmetry; and (iii) variation in the interlayer distance, which preserves structural symmetry. In particular, we demonstrate that material losses inevitably induce radiation in Fabry-Pérot BICs via second-order perturbation processes, converting them into quasi-BICs, while symmetry-protected BICs remain non-radiative. We further show that, despite the inherent instability of BICs under symmetry-breaking effects, their resilience can be significantly enhanced through proper design. Both Fabry-Pérot and symmetry-protected BICs exhibit exponentially weak sensitivity to C$_2$-breaking perturbations as the interlayer distance increases. Finally, we show that additional FP-BICs emerge under oblique incidence, originating from the interference of two high-Q quasi-BICs near the symmetry-protected ones. Our findings pave the way for the development of BIC-based photonic devices with improved robustness against fabrication imperfections, environmental variations, and material losses.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of extremely thin concentration boundary layers at fluid interfaces for high local Péclet numbers is a severe obstacle for efficient and accurate numerical simulation of mass transfer processes in two-phase fluid systems. Especially challenging are liquid-liquid systems, in which thin concentration boundary layers can appear on both sides of the fluid interface under convection-dominated conditions. In those cases, the one-sided species concentrations at the interface are a-priori not even known approximately, but are determined by a conjugate mass transfer problem governed by interfacial jump conditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge we for the first time introduce a two-sided Subgrid-Scale (SGS) boundary layer model for conjugate mass transfer at fluid interfaces. It accurately computes the local mass transfer rates on moderate or coarse mesh resolutions even when very high concentration gradients in interface vicinity occur. For this purpose, SGS modeling is applied on both sides of an interface transmissive to passive scalars, such as the interface in a two-phase fluid system, enabling the accurate capture of conjugate mass transfer across thin boundary layer on one or on both sides of the interface. We implement our approach in the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface-Tracking (ALE-IT) OpenFOAM module twoPhaseInterTrackFoam. We have made twoPhaseInterTrackFoam publicly available in our previous publication (Schwarzmeier et al., 2025).",

By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.",

The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool. Furthermore, we draw a comparison between a quantum-mechanical and a classical version of spinDMFT showing that local quantum effects are of great importance for the studied type of system.",

    "abstract": "Wall-pressure fluctuations beneath turbulent boundary layers drive noise and structural fatigue through interactions between fluid and structural modes. Conventional predictive models for the spectrum--such as the widely accepted Goody model (\\textit{AIAA Journal} 42 (9), 2004, 1788--1794)--fail to capture the energetic growth in the {low-frequency range} that occurs at high Reynolds number, while at the same time over-predicting the variance. To address these shortcomings, two semi-empirical models are proposed for the wall-pressure spectrum in canonical turbulent boundary layers, pipes and channels for friction Reynolds numbers $\\delta^+$ ranging from 180 to 47 000. Consistent with the approach outlined modelling the streamwise Reynolds stress in the recent work of Gustenyov et al. (\\textit{J. Fluid Mech.} 1016, 2025, A23), the models are based on consideration of two eddy populations that broadly represent the contributions to the wall pressure fluctuations from inner-scale motions and outer-scale motions. The first model expresses the pre-multiplied spectrum as the sum of two overlapping log-normal populations: an inner-scaled term that is $\\delta^+$-invariant and an outer-scaled term whose amplitude broadens smoothly with $\\delta^+$. The model reproduces the 1-D convective signature and the emergence of an outer-scaled peak at large $\\delta^+$. The second model, developed around newly available pipe data, uses theoretical arguments to prescribe the spectral shapes of the inner and outer populations. Embedding the $\\delta^+$-dependence in smooth asymptotic functions yields a formulation that varies continuously with $\\delta^+$ {and generalises beyond the calibration range}. Both models capture the full spectrum and {recover} the observed logarithmic growth of its variance, laying the groundwork for more accurate engineering predictions of wall-pressure fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.",

Our results demonstrate that beam charge (10-600 pC) can be effectively controlled by adjusting these parameters. We identify a saturation threshold in the nanoparticle electric field strength, beyond which beam charge depends on the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle rather than on the electron density after ionization. Significant electron injection occurs across multiple plasma wave periods with distribution patterns influenced by nanoparticle properties leading to increased beam charge but a broader energy spread. These findings offer practical guidelines for experimental implementation of nanoparticle-assisted injection in laser wakefield accelerators to tailor electron beam characteristics for various applications.",

    "abstract": "A simple nonholonomic dynamics model is developed as a low-order model for generating undulatory swim-like motions, validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The rigid-body-dynamics model generates swimming motion by imposing a nonholonomic (NH) constraint on the tail of a two-body system, requiring that tail-fin velocity aligns with the tail angle, while the head moves in a straight line through a slot constraint. The system has one degree of freedom, with equations of motion derived using Lagrange multipliers. Two-dimensional CFD simulations validate the model in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, where the resolved tail fin interacts with fluid through the immersed boundary method until steady-state swimming is achieved. The validation demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement between CFD and model predictions for body orientation angle and normal fluid force across variations in fin motion amplitude, period, and Reynolds number. While an exact NH constraint point does not exist, an effective period-averaged NH location can be identified for successful model predictions. At higher Reynolds numbers, the two-body kinematics displays independence from the Reynolds number variation. The CFD data reveal that the two-body model captures the type of power-law relationship between Reynolds and Strouhal numbers governing undulatory swimming from tadpoles to whales, indicating that the simplified two-link model is representative of swimming dynamics in continuous geometries at various scales. A key limitation is that the drag force model requires a priori CFD calibration to match steady-swim velocity, limiting standalone predictive capability. The results demonstrate that the low-order NH constraint-based model effectively captures essential swimming dynamics, offering a robust alternative to existing fluid-force models.",

    "abstract": "Ring polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a mixed quantum-classical dynamics method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into nonadiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our simulations of symmetric potentials, i.e., without energy bias, show that the RPSH-CA method, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, is satisfactorily accurate and robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and nonadiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Overall, the effect of DBOC in RPSH-CA is in moderation compared to conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method where DBOC over-damps the dynamics significantly and reduces accuracy considerably, especially at low temperatures. However, the RPSH-CA and its DBOC variant struggle in simulations of asymmetric potentials specially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the high temperature adiabatic reaction regimes with symmetric potentials. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to nonadiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.",

In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 $^\\circ$C and 800 $^\\circ$C, with 50 $^\\circ$C temperature increments.

The devices and material stack are further analyzed with resistivity structures, optical microscope images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments.",

We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center \"recognition\" potentials. These \\textit{recognition} sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.",

    "abstract": "Groundbreaking advances in materials and chemical research have been driven by the development of atomistic simulations. However, the broader applicability of atomistic simulations remains limited, as they inherently depend on energy models that are either approximate or computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have recently emerged as a promising class of energy models, but their deployment also remains challenging due to the scarcity of systematic protocols for generating training data spanning diverse structural regimes. Here we introduce GAIA, an end-to-end automated framework that streamlines dataset construction for the development of general-purpose reactive MLIPs. GAIA combines a metadynamics-based exploration scheme with closed-loop data expansion for the efficient sampling of a broad spectrum of atomic arrangements, thereby addressing the reliance on heuristics in conventional dataset generation. Using GAIA, we constructed Titan25, a benchmark-scale dataset, and trained an MLIP that closely matches both static and dynamic density functional theory results. The resulting model reproduces key experimental observations across distinct modes of reactivity, including detonation, coalescence, and catalytic processes. GAIA thus helps bridge the gap between simulation and experiment, paving the way toward scalable and general MLIPs capable of describing a wide range of materials and chemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive how transverse relaxation depends on the angle between axons and the external magnetic field. Simulations show that the time-dependent power-law signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be difficult to detect at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. This is because the power-law curvature over a typical range of echo times deviates only slightly from a linear trend. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers.",

DMTS uses a dual-level neural network where the target accurate potential is coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process. The 3.5 Å-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast-varying forces, i.e., mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: nearly 4-fold in homogeneous systems and 3-fold in large solvated proteins through leveraging active learning for enhanced stability. Such a strategy is applicable to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with classical force fields.",

    "abstract": "Forecast models in statistical seismology are commonly evaluated with log-likelihood scores of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake numbers, yet heavy tails and out-of-range observations can bias model ranking. We develop a tail-aware evaluation framework that estimates cell-wise P(n) using adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation and tests three strategies for handling out-of-range counts. Using the AoyuX platform, we perform a ~25-year month-by-month pseudo-prospective forecast experiment in the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES), comparing Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model with a homogeneous background (ETAS{\\mu}) to a spatially heterogeneous variant (ETAS{\\mu}(x,y)) across six spatial resolutions and five magnitude thresholds. Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) of counts per cell are well described by power laws with exponents a = 1.40 +- 0.21 across all settings. Using previous theoretical results, this provides a robust estimate of the productivity exponent, {\\alpha} = 0.57 +- 0.08 using a b-value equal to 0.8, providing a valuable quantification of this key parameter in aftershock modeling. Model ranking is sensitive to how the tail of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake counts is treated: power law extrapolation is both theoretically justified and empirically the most robust. Cumulative information gain (CIG) shows that ETAS{\\mu}(x,y) outperforms ETAS{\\mu} in data-rich configurations, whereas in data-poor settings stochastic fluctuations dominate. A coefficient-of-variation analysis of per-window log-likelihood differences distinguishes genuine upward trends in CIG from noise-dominated fluctuations. By aligning a fat-tail-aware scoring methodology with an open testing platform, our work advances fair and statistically grounded assessment of earthquake forecasting models for the CSES and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Supply chains' increasing globalization and complexity have recently produced unpredictable disruptions, ripple effects, and cascading resulting failures. Proposed practices for managing these concerns include the advanced field of forward stress testing, where threats and predicted impacts to the supply chain are evaluated to harden the system against the most damaging scenarios. Such approaches are limited by the almost endless number of potential threat scenarios and cannot capture residual risk. In contrast to forward stress testing, this paper develops a reverse stress testing (RST) methodology that allows to predict which changes, with probabilistic certainty, across the supply chain network are most likely to cause a specified level of disruption at a specific entity in the network. The methodology was applied to the case of copper wire imports into the USA, a simple good which may have significant implications for national security. Results show that Canada, Chile, and Mexico are predicted to consistently be sources of disruptions at multiple loss levels. Other countries (e.g., Papua New Guinea) may contribute to small disruptions but be less important for the catastrophic losses of concern for decision makers. Other countries' disruptions would be catastrophic (e.g., Chile). The proposed methodology is the first case of reverse stress testing application in complex multilayered supply chains and can be used to address both risk and resilience.",

The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD.

    "abstract": "Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\\Omega/\\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.",

Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at this https URL , we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications.",

    "abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has been recognized globally as a promising framework that embeds agriculture within social relations, yet its diffusion remains limited in contexts such as Japan. Existing studies have largely focused on either consumer or producer participation in isolation, offering fragmented insights and leaving unexplored how their reciprocal processes jointly shape CSA communities. This study addresses this gap by integrating the trajectories of both groups into a comprehensive account of CSA community formation. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with ten CSA producers and ten consumers, we employed the Modified Grounded Theory Approach (M-GTA) to inductively theorize processes of participation and practice. The analysis showed that producers advance CSA through internal adjustments and sense-making to cope with uncertainties, while consumers are guided by life events, practical skills, and prior purchasing experiences toward participation. Synthesizing these insights, we propose a six-phase model of CSA community formation, dispersed interest, awareness, interest formation, motivation, practice, and co-creative continuation, that demonstrates how producers, consumers, and intermediaries interact across stages. The model highlights the pivotal role of key players in sustaining engagement and provides a new perspective for institutionalizing CSA as a durable component of sustainable food systems.",

Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing.",

We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.",

Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $\\omega_p \\ll \\omega_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $\\omega_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency.

This measurement utilizes data from 6.4$\\times10^{20}$ protons on target of exposure collected using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam with a mean neutrino energy of approximately 0.8~GeV. The mapping from reconstructed kinematics to truth quantities, particularly from reconstructed to true neutrino energy, is validated within uncertainties by comparing the distribution of reconstructed hadronic energy in data to that of the model prediction in different muon scattering angle bins after applying a conditional constraint from the muon momentum distribution in data. The success of this validation gives confidence that the missing energy in the MicroBooNE detector is well-modeled within uncertainties in simulation, enabling the unfolding to a three-dimensional measurement over muon momentum, muon scattering angle, and neutrino energy. The unfolded measurement covers an extensive phase space, providing a wealth of information useful for future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments measuring neutrino oscillations. Comparisons against a number of commonly used model predictions are included and their performance in different parts of the available phase-space is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - \"Schwinger atoms\" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.",

We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.",

Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 13 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has three consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states, these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles, and quantum systems do not have definite properties prior to measurement. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.",

However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.",

In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.",

We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.",

Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.",

Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.",

    "abstract": "Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial fusion due to their inherent resilience to current driven disruptions. Here, we release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes, paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single objective geometric optimization problem, (2) a \"simple-to-build\" QI stellarator, and (3) a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to the grid.",

It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.",

However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.",

    "title": "Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps",
    "abstract": "Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.",

    "abstract": "Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.",

Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.",

By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \\times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \\times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \\times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \\sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility.

Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.",

    "abstract": "The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations",

Inspired by prior work employing quantum strategies in the prisoners dilemma, we showed that when similar quantum mechanics principles are applied to the centipede game, it leads to two new quantum Nash equilibria that are superior to the classical solution. Furthermore, by implementing our algorithm on Qiskit, we confirmed that leveraging quantum strategies, rather than strategies like backward induction, to solve the centipede game provided better payoffs for both players and more accurately modeled the games real-life outcomes.

In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field.

The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an \"offline closed-loop, online open-loop\" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.",

We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.",

In general, quantum Zeno dynamics is obtained with an error of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, where $N$ is the number of projective measurements performed within a fixed evolution time. In this work, we develop higher-order Zeno sequences that achieve faster convergence to Zeno dynamics, yielding an improved error scaling of $\\mathcal{O}(1/N^{2k})$, where $k$ describes the order of the Zeno sequence. This is achieved by relating higher-order Zeno sequences to higher-order Trotter formulas that achieve similar convergence behavior. We leverage this relation to develop higher-order Zeno sequences for different manifestations of the quantum Zeno effect, including frequent projective measurements and unitary kicks. We go on to discuss achieving quantum Zeno dynamics through periodic control fields of high frequency. We explicitly develop control fields that yield a second-order type improvement in the Zeno error scaling and present shorter Zeno sequences. Finally, we discuss the connection to randomized and Uhrig dynamical decoupling to develop more efficient implementations in the weak coupling regime.",

    "abstract": "The preparation and control of quantum states lie at the heart of quantum information science (QIS). Recent advances in solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) and nanophotonics have transformed the landscape of quantum photonic technologies, enabling scalable generation of quantum states of light and matter. A new frontier in solid-state quantum photonics is the engineering of many-body interactions between QEs and photons to achieve robust coherence and controllable many-body entanglement. These entangled states, including photonic graph and cluster states, superradiant emission, and emergent quantum phases, are promising for quantum computation, sensing, and simulation. However, intrinsic inhomogeneities and decoherence in solid-state platforms pose significant challenges to realize such complex entangled states. This review provides an overview of the fundamental many-body interactions and dynamics at the light-matter interfaces of solid-state QEs, and discusses recent advances in mitigating decoherence and harnessing robust many-body coherence.",

The momentum-energy representation $\\phi(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert.

The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.",

    "abstract": "Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.",

Furthermore, when fed a small-amplitude SC state, the protocol acts as a non-Gaussianity amplifier, distilling it into high-purity approximations of key quantum resources like specific photon-number superpositions. This work transforms the OPA from a specialized source into a versatile and practical platform for advanced quantum state engineering, enabling the generation of a wide array of non-Gaussian states from a single, integrated setup.",

This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a promising approach for ground-state energy estimation in the near-term quantum computing era. A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\\phi=\\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \\rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.",

Technically, we formulate a representation-theoretical framework based on Schur-Weyl duality and permutation symmetry calculus that reduce the higher-moment Haar averages to a finite set of trace invariants of the composed correction unitaries. This yields closed-form expressions for $F$ and $D$ in arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension and delivers tight bounds that link the admissible deviation directly to the gap from the optimal average performance. In particular, any measured pair $(F, D)$ can be ported into a visibility estimate for isotropic channel resources, turning the $(F, D)$-plane into a calibrated diagnostic map. We further cast the teleportation advantage and CGLMP-inequality violation as two witnesses lines in the $(F,D)$ plane: one line certifies that $F$ beats the classical benchmark $2/(d{+}1)$, while the other line certifies the Bell nonlocality. Their identical slope but distinct intercepts expose a quantitative gap between \"entangled yet local\" and \"genuinely nonlocal\" resources.",

This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states. In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry. The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains.",

Numerical simulations show that the key rates of passiveand active-measurement implementations are nearly identical, indicating that passive measurement does not compromise key-generation efficiency in practical QKD systems.",

    "title": "The Quantum Agreement Theorem",
    "abstract": "We formulate and prove an Agreement Theorem for quantum mechanics (QM), describing when two agents, represented by separate laboratories, can or cannot maintain differing probability estimates of a shared quantum property of interest. Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of \"common certainty\" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording. We establish an impossibility result stating that QM forbids a scenario where one agent is certain that a property of interest occurs, and is also certain that the other agent is certain that the property does not occur. In this sense, QM admits non-classical disagreement, but disagreement is still bounded in a disciplined way. We argue that our analysis offers a rigorous approach to the longstanding issue of how to understand intersubjectivity across agents in QM.",

    "abstract": "Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^{\\alpha}$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\\alpha$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\\alpha$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\\alpha=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\\alpha$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\\alpha=0$, we find that for small $\\alpha$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\\alpha=0$. At intermediate $\\alpha$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\\alpha$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\\tau$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\\alpha$ when $\\tau$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\\alpha$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.",

Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.",

To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds.

With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum entanglement holds promising application for exploring fundamental physical theories. The experimental scheme of Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) was proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theory. In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases. We then discuss the possibility of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement with these results.",

This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\\rm{H}_2\\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\\gamma_\\Omega$), electrons ($\\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\\gamma_\\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\\gamma_\\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\\rm{H},\\rm{H}\\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization.

Using insights from stabilizer quantum error correcting codes, we rigorously show that the spatial distribution of magic can be inferred from a canonical representation of low-magic states, dubbed the bipartite magic gauge. Moreover, we propose two operationally relevant magic length scales. We numerically establish that, at early times, both length scales grow ballistically at distinct velocities set by the entanglement velocity, after which magic delocalizes.

In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.",

The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining.

The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength.",

Prominent examples of such \"impossible measurements\", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in \"impossible measurement\" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.",

By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG.

    "abstract": "Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding.",

    "abstract": "Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and thus extending the distance at which QKD links can be securely established. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering the amount of information that has to be disclosed during the information reconciliation step. In this work we present the first comprehensive finite key-size analysis of decoy-state BB84 enhanced via AD post-processing. We demonstrate that through the use of AD the maximum acceptable QBER increases from around $9.5\\%$ to around $17.3\\%$ for realistic key sizes. This result shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved in scenarios which are constrained by the maximum tolerable QBER via improvements of the post-processing method alone.",

    "abstract": "We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\\,{=}\\,\\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\\,{\\leq}\\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\\#}\\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\\#}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information.

Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.",

Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral.

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.",

Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level.

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.",

Here we provide such a method, given by an extended circuit formalism. This only requires directed graphs endowed with Boolean matrices, which encode basic constraints on operations. Our framework (a) defines a set of elementary rules for checking the validity of any such graph, (b) provides a way of constructing consistent processes as a circuit from valid graphs, and (c) yields an intuitive interpretation of the causal relations within a process and an explanation of why they do not lead to inconsistencies. We display how several standard examples of exotic processes, including ones that violate causal inequalities, are among the class of processes that can be generated in this way; we conjecture that this class in fact includes all unitarily extendible processes.",

To investigate intrinsic optomechanical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, it is essential to strengthen the interaction between a single photon and a finite number of phonons. In this work, we enhance the optomechanical coupling by introducing a two-laser driving scheme together with a second-order nonlinear contribution to the cavity resonance frequency, which overtakes the original radiation-pressure nonlinearity as the dominant part in a prototypical Fabry-Pérot cavity. By properly tuning the two driving lasers and the cross-Kerr interaction so that the effective coupling becomes real, we theoretically establish a symmetric optomechanical model at the single-photon level where photon and phonon mode fluctuations exhibit identical dynamics. Within this framework, we analyze the optimal reciprocal transport of the input laser field. Through examination of the optimal signal transmission, we identify the critical boundary associated with the onset of the strong-coupling regime. Additionally, we compare the optical signal scattering behavior in both dissipative equilibrium and nonequilibrium symmetric optomechanical systems, with and without non-rotating-wave contributions. Our work achieves controllable enhancement of the optomechanical coupling and enables optimal signal transfer even in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, suggesting a promising route toward tunable single-photon optomechanical functionalities.",

We point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that the dynamics obeys Hamiltonian formalism or a particular decomposition property set out in the paper, the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the quantum system, whereas the quantum gravitational field can do so. Drawing upon the fundamental relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects, our analysis offers new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity and provides a novel interpretation of existing experimental observations, such as free fall.",

    "abstract": "Tamper-detection codes (TDCs) are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. A TDC encodes messages in such a manner that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output the original message, or reject it. In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied adversarial tampering models: the so-called $t$-split-state tampering model, where the codeword is divided into $t$ shares, and each share is tampered with \"locally\". It is impossible to achieve tamper detection in the split-state model using classical codewords. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the situation changes significantly if the message can be encoded into a multipartite quantum state, entangled across the $t$ shares. Concretely, we define a family of quantum TDCs defined on any $t\\geq 3$ shares, which can detect arbitrary split-state tampering so long as the adversaries are unentangled, or even limited to a finite amount of pre-shared entanglement. Previously, this was only known in the limit of asymptotically large $t$. As our flagship application, we show how to augment threshold secret sharing schemes with similar tamper-detecting guarantees. We complement our results by establishing connections between quantum TDCs and quantum encryption schemes.",

However, the charge-to-mass ($Q/m$) selectivity of RF traps limits the range of objects that can be confined simultaneously in the same trap. Here, we confine two particles - a nanoparticle and an atomic ion - in the same radiofrequency trap although their charge-to-mass ratios differ by six orders of magnitude. The confinement is enabled by a dual-frequency voltage applied to the trap electrodes. We introduce a robust loading procedure under ultra-high vacuum and characterize the stability of both particles. It is observed that slow-field micromotion, an effect specific to the dual-field setting, plays a crucial role for ion localization.

In this work, we establish analytical lower bounds for the query complexity of unitary inversion, transposition, and complex conjugation, which hold even if the input unitary is an unknown logarithmic-depth unitary. Specifically, our lower bound of $d^2$ for unitary inversion demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of the deterministic exact inversion protocol, which operates with $O(d^2)$ queries. We introduce a novel framework utilizing differentiation to derive these lower bounds on query complexity for general differentiable functions $f: \\mathrm{SU}(d)\\to \\mathrm{SU}(d)$. As a corollary, we prove that a catalytic protocol -- a new concept recently noted in the study of exact unitary inversion -- is impossible for unitary complex conjugation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the partially known setting, where the input unitary operation is promised to be within a subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ and the probabilistic setting, where transformations succeed probabilistically.",

Existing quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups for the quantum linear system problem (QLSP) in terms of the problem dimension, but the advantage is bottlenecked by condition number of the coefficient matrix. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for QLSP inspired by the classical proximal point algorithm (PPA). Our proposed method can be viewed as a meta-algorithm that allows inverting a modified matrix via an existing \\texttt{QLSP\\_solver}, thereby directly approximating the solution vector instead of approximating the inverse of the coefficient matrix. By carefully choosing the step size $\\eta$, the proposed algorithm can effectively precondition the linear system to mitigate the dependence on condition numbers that hindered the applicability of previous approaches. Importantly, this is the first iterative framework for QLSP where a tunable parameter $\\eta$ and initialization $x_0$ allows controlling the trade-off between the runtime and approximation error.",

Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.",

We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we show that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before. To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\\langle c_i^\\dagger c_j \\rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\\langle c_{i_1}^\\dagger c^\\dagger_{i_2} \\cdots c_{i_n} \\rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.",

Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization with energy expressed as a quadratic form involving the Hamiltonian. When SQM represents states as unitary operators, the stationary problem becomes a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Any stationary SQM problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The non-stationary SQM problem considers the evolution of the system itself, involving the same ``energy'' operator as in the stationary case. Two possible options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. As an immediately available practical application of the theory, we consider using a quantum channel as a classical computational model; this type of computation can be performed on a classical computer.",

From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schrödinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincaré algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.",

Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - \"Schwinger atoms\" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs.

Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 13 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has three consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states, these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles, and quantum systems do not have definite properties prior to measurement. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.",

    "abstract": "Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.",

    "abstract": "Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.",

    "abstract": "Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.",

    "abstract": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

    "abstract": "Single-shot error correction outperforms conventional approaches by requiring only one round of stabilizer measurements for decoding, even in the presence of measurement errors. This capability relates to the confinement property of codes, which provides an energy barrier lower bound. Earlier research established a confinement property for higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HHGP) codes (Quintavalle et al. 2021 PRX Quantum), yielding an energy barrier lower bound for these codes. In this work, by analyzing the structure of logical operators, we show an improved energy barrier lower bound for HHGP codes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) property. Our bound exceeds results derived from confinement alone, and unlike standard hypergraph product codes, these higher dimensional variants can possess macroscopic energy barriers even when the underlying classical codes lack this property. Specifically, our analysis shows that the energy barrier of LDPC HHGP codes is lower bounded by the distance of the underlying classical codes. This bound is tight if the underlying classical codes exhibit system size-dependent distances but constant energy barriers, like 3D and 4D toric codes.",

However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.",

The previous study demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.",

On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k<d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.",

It requires, however, to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes if the amplitude matrix is sufficiently sparse. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits.

Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior publicly-verifiable NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string. 2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain a publicly-verifiable non-interactive argument of quantum knowledge, previously only known in a privately-verifiable setting (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020). Our construction introduces a novel ZX QMA verifier with \"strong completeness\" and builds upon the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) within the context of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme. The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. Rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. As an additional contribution, we study a general method for replacing heuristic use of obfuscation with heuristic use of hash functions in the post-quantum setting. In particular, we establish security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model (QPrO), which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This gives us NIZK arguments of quantum knowledge for QMA in the QPrO, and additionally allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the QPrO.",

For good qLDPC codes, the time overhead is minimized and reaches $O(d^{1+o(1)})$. In contrast, code surgery based on gauging measurement and brute-force branching requires a time overhead of $O(dw^{1+o(1)})$, where $d\\leq w\\leq n$. Thus, our scheme is asymptotically faster for all codes with $a < 2$. This speedup is achieved by developing techniques that enable parallelized code surgery under constant qubit overhead and leverage classical locally testable codes for efficient resource state preparation.

Even when the which-path information is merely retained in specific quantum path-markers, without being actually read, it suffices to eliminate interference. Nevertheless, if this path information is ``erased'' in some manner, the interference re-emerges, a phenomenon referred to as the quantum eraser. An intriguing aspect of this experiment is that if the path information is erased \\emph{after} the particle has been detected on the screen, the interference still reappears, a phenomenon known as the delayed-choice quantum eraser. This observation has led to the interpretation that the particle can be influenced to exhibit characteristics of either a particle or a wave based on a decision made long after it has been registered on the screen.

Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in coupled oscillators signal non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature corresponding to two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects, frequency shifts and squeezing, represent the same underlying phenomenon but expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests itself as entanglement in the other. Frequency shifts therefore constitute an entanglement witness accessible via standard spectroscopy. While the underlying squeezing is not directly measurable, it can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. This uncovers a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persists across the quantum-to-classical boundary.",

By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.",

    "title": "Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes",
    "abstract": "We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.",

Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from \"simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence\" to \"compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction\", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.",

Our main results are quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. The exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented online without the need for variational techniques. Importantly, the reverse SDEs and corresponding processes are generalizations of their forward counterparts. One can recover the forward process from its reverse, meaning that the reverse process experiences the same decoherence and noise effects as the forward process. This establishes an analytical framework for noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.",

Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.",

    "abstract": "Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.",

Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.",

Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.",

At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22.

Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states.",

Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\\lceil{m/2}\\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the CNOT gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \\log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \\log \\log(m)/\\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$, including reductions in both CNOT and Toffoli gate counts. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.",

By modifying the equality, which relates the conductivity and polarization expressions, the predictions of quantum field theory were revised and brought in agreement with those following from the nonrelativistic Kubo model. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable.

Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation.

    "title": "Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping",
    "abstract": "Ring polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a mixed quantum-classical dynamics method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into nonadiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our simulations of symmetric potentials, i.e., without energy bias, show that the RPSH-CA method, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, is satisfactorily accurate and robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and nonadiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Overall, the effect of DBOC in RPSH-CA is in moderation compared to conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method where DBOC over-damps the dynamics significantly and reduces accuracy considerably, especially at low temperatures. However, the RPSH-CA and its DBOC variant struggle in simulations of asymmetric potentials specially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the high temperature adiabatic reaction regimes with symmetric potentials. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to nonadiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.",

The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.",

    "abstract": "Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\\Omega/\\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.",

Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.",

We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.",

    "abstract": "Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines.",

However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.",

By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings.

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the homological and geometric foundations of non-commutative n-ary Gamma-semirings, unifying two previously distinct directions in Gamma-algebra: the derived Gamma-geometry developed for the commutative ternary case and the structural and spectral theory for general non-commutative n-ary systems. We introduce categories of left, right, and bi-Gamma-modules that respect positional asymmetry and prove that they form additive and exact categories in Quillen's sense. Within this setting, we construct projective and injective resolutions, define the derived functors Ext^Gamma and Tor_Gamma, and establish long exact sequences and spectral balance theorems in the n-ary regime. By extending sheaf-theoretic and homological tools to the non-commutative Gamma-spectrum Spec_Gamma^nc(T), we obtain a coherent framework of non-commutative derived Gamma-geometry that parallels the classical paradigms of Grothendieck and Kontsevich in homological algebra and non-commutative geometry. The framework developed here establishes the foundational exact-categorical and homological structures that enable Morita-type analyses and spectral interpretations in the subsequent parts of this series.",

    "abstract": "We present a spectrally accurate fast algorithm for evaluating the solution to the scalar wave equation in free space driven by a large collection of point sources in a bounded domain. With $M$ sources temporally discretized by $N_t$ time steps of size $\\Delta t$, a naive potential evaluation at $M$ targets on the same time grid requires $\\mathcal O(M^2 N_t)$ work. Our scheme requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left((M + N^3\\log N)N_t\\right)$ work, where $N$ scales as $\\mathcal O(1/\\Delta t)$, i.e., the maximum signal frequency. This is achieved by using the recently-proposed windowed Fourier projection (WFP) method to split the potential into a local part, evaluated directly, plus a smooth history part approximated by an $N^3$-point equispaced discretization of the Fourier transform, where each Fourier coefficient obeys a simple recursion relation. The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself. Thus, the method avoids the need for absorbing boundary conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with up to a million sources and targets at 6-digit accuracy. We believe it can serve as a key component in addressing time-domain wave equation scattering problems.",

The key step in both the free and $q$-Gaussian settings is a polarization identity for fourth cumulants of sums which holds only when the two terms have differing parities.

They are frequently used in a variety of applications, and thus it is imperative to have a thorough theoretical understanding of their behavior. Most theoretical convergence results for stochastic iterative methods provide bounds on the expected error of the iterates, and yield a type of average case analysis. However, understanding the behavior of these methods in the near-worst-case is desirable. For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error. Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities.",

Unlike adversarial distribution shift frameworks that yield conservative worst-case guarantees, RUPs induce dataset-level variance inflation rather than systematic bias. We provide examples of RUPs and show that this distributional uncertainty reduces the effective sample size to $n_{\\mathrm{eff}} = n/(1 + n \\tau)$, where $\\tau\\in [0,1]$ quantifies the perturbation strength. For local polynomial estimators, we derive an extended bias-variance decomposition that includes a distributional variance term with the same bandwidth scaling as classical sampling variance. This leads to a modified bandwidth selection principle: when distributional uncertainty dominates sampling uncertainty ($\\tau \\gg 1/n$), optimal bandwidths scale as $\\tau^{1/(2\\beta+1)}$ rather than the usual $n^{-1/(2\\beta+1)}$, where $\\beta$ indicates the smoothness of the function class considered.

This homology admits a natural ring structure and a Schubert basis, giving rise to a well-defined Schubert calculus. We realize $H_*^T(\\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ in terms of symmetric functions. Our first main result introduces a new family of symmetric functions, called the \\emph{dual affine Schur $P$-functions}, which represent the Schubert classes. These functions are defined through the action of the affine nil-Hecke algebra, and specialize, in the stable limit as $n\\to \\infty$, to the dual factorial $P$-functions of Nakagawa and Naruse. Our second main result gives a precise comparison between this symmetric function model and the geometric construction of $H_*^T (\\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ due to Ginzburg and Peterson, which identifies it with a coordinate ring of a centralizer family in the Langlands dual group.",

In this work, we propose a topology optimization model for electrode structure to maximize energy storage in supercapacitors. The existence of minimizers to the resulting optimal control problem, which is constrained by a modified steady-state Poisson--Nernst--Planck system describing ionic electrodiffusion, has been theoretically established by using the direct method in the calculus of variation. Sensitivity analysis of the topology optimization model is performed to derive variational derivatives and corresponding adjoint equations. A gradient flow formulation discretized by a stabilized semi-implicit scheme is developed to solve the resulting topology optimization problem. Extensive numerical experiments present various porous electrode structures that own large area of electrode-electrolyte interface, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed topology optimization model and corresponding algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We establish sharp stability results for of non--selfadjoint the ascent and descent spectra under strong resolvent convergence (SRS), a natural framework for finite element approximations of non-selfadjoint and singularly perturbed operators. The key quantitative hypothesis is the reduced minimum modulus $\\gamma(T-\\lambda)>0$, which guarantees closed range and enables the transfer of the Kaashoek -- Taylor criteria via gap convergence of operator graphs. At the essential level, B--Fredholm theory extends stability to powers $(T-\\lambda)^m$ provided $\\gamma((T-\\lambda)^j)>0$ for all $1\\le j\\le m$. We introduce a computable finite-element diagnostic $\\gamma_h = \\sigma_{\\min}(M^{-1/2}(A_h-\\lambda M)M^{-1/2})$, which serves as a practical surrogate for $\\gamma(T-\\lambda)$ and remains uniformly positive even in convection-dominated regimes when stabilized schemes (e.g., SUPG) are employed.

The main object of combinatorial game theory is to obtain the outcome, which player has a winning strategy, of a given combinatorial game. Positions of many well-known combinatorial games are naturally decomposed into a disjunctive sum of multiple components and can be analyzed independently for each component. Therefore, the study of disjunctive sums is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. Combinatorial games in which both players have the same set of possible moves for every position are called impartial games. In the normal-play convention, it is known that the outcome of a disjunctive sum of impartial games can be obtained by computing the Grundy number of each term. The theory of impartial games is generalized in various forms. This paper proposes another generalization of impartial games to a new framework, impartial games with activeness: each game is assigned a status of either ``active'' or ``inactive''; the status may change by moves; a disjunctive sum of games ends immediately, not only when no further moves can be made, but also when all terms become inactive. We formally introduce impartial games with activeness and investigate their fundamental properties.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.",

To this end, we introduce five 'unorthodox' algebras that will play a major role, not only in providing a positive answer to the question, but also in their similarity to the 2-element Boolean algebra 2. Yet, they are remarkably dissimilar from 2 in many respects. In this paper, we will examine these five algebras both algebraically and logically. We define, and initiate an investigation into, a subvariety, called RUNO1, of the variety of De Morgan semi-Heyting algebras and show that RUNO1 is, in fact, the variety generated by the five algebras. Then several applications of this theorem are given. It is shown that RUNO1 is a discriminator variety and that all five algebras are primal. It is also shown that every subvariety of RUNO1 satisfies the Strong Amalgamation Property and the property that epimorphisms are surjective (ES). It is shown that the lattice of subvarieties of RUNO1 is a Boolean lattice of 32 elements. The bases for all the subvarieties of RUNO1 are also given. We introduce a new logic called mathcal{RUNO1} and show that it is algebraizable with the variety RUNO1 as its equivalent algebraic semantics. We then present axiomatizations for all 32 axiomatic extensions of mathcal{RUNO1} and deduce that all the axiomatic extensions are decidable. The paper ends with some open problems.",

This work introduces a novel third-order temporally accurate and stable numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, aiming to address the limitations in accuracy and efficiency often encountered with conventional approaches. Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $\\alpha$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis. Salient distinctions between the proposed scheme and an existing third-order semi-implicit method include: (1) Solving the linear system associated with the existing scheme demands substantially greater computational time, underscoring the need for highly efficient solvers; (2) Although the proposed method shows increased sensitivity to damping parameters, it reliably converges to stable physical states and is effective in simulating magnetic domain wall motion, producing outcomes consistent with prior validated studies; (3) The energy levels computed by the proposed method are significantly lower than those obtained via the existing third-order scheme.",

Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches.",

Let ${\\bf a}=(a_1, \\ldots, a_n, \\ldots)$ be a non-increasing positive sequence such that $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=1.$ Then each real number $0\\le r \\le 1$ can be represented in the form \\( r=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n, \\,\\,\\, \\varepsilon_n \\in \\{0,1\\}, n\\ge 1, \\) if and only if the sequence ${\\bf a}$ satisfies \\(a_n \\le 1-\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n a_k \\) for all $n\\ge 1.$ A set $K$ of all sequences that satisfy the last property can be represented as a convex weak-compact subset of $\\ell_1 = c_0^*$. We will describe the set of all extreme points of $K.$",

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and order $n$. A coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a dominating set but whose union $V_1 \\cup V_2$ is a dominating set. A coalition partition, abbreviated $c$-partition, in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\\pi=\\left\\{V_1 , V_2,\\dots, V_k\\right\\}$ such that every set $V_i$ of $\\pi$ is either a singleton dominating set, or is not a dominating set but forms a coalition with another set $V_j$ in $\\pi$. The sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $G$. The coalition number $C(G)$ equals the maximum order $k$ of a $c$-partition of $G$. For any graph $G$ with a $c$-partition $\\pi=\\left\\{V_1,V_2,\\dots,V_k\\right\\}$, the coalition graph $CG(G,\\pi)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V_1,V_2,\\dots, V_k$, corresponding one-to-one with the set $\\pi$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $CG(G,\\pi)$ if and only if the sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $\\pi$. In [4], authors proved that for every graph $G$ there exist a graph $H$ and $c$-partition $\\pi$ such that $CG(H,\\pi)\\cong G$, and raised the question: Does there exist a graph $H^*$ of smaller order $n^*$ and size $m^*$ with a $c$-partition $\\pi^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\\pi^*)\\cong G$?. In this paper, we constructed a graph $H^*$ of small order and size and a $c$- partition $\\pi^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\\pi^*)\\cong G$. Recently, Haynes et al.[5] defined the coalition count $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum number of different coalition in any $c$-partition of $G$. We characterize all graphs $G$ with $c(G)=1$. Further, imposing some suitable conditions on coalition number, we study the properties of coalition count of graph.",

This is due to Brugallé and does not involve any tropical geometry. The second lecture explores the relations with tropical geometry, and contains an introduction to toric varieties and tropical geometry. We discuss the correspondence theorem of Mikhalkin, and show how the corresponding tropical enumerative problem can be formulated in terms of the combinatorial problem of counting floor diagrams. We give many examples throughout, inspired by the study of the enumerative geometry of $K3$ surfaces, by degeneration to unions of rational surfaces with dual complex a tiling of the $\\mathbf{S}^2$ sphere.",

We determine asymptotic lower and upper bounds for the ratio between the order and the diameter of girth-diameter cages as the diameter goes to infinity. We also prove that this ratio can be computed in constant time for fixed $k$ and $g$. We theoretically determine the exact values $n(3;g,d)$, and count the number of corresponding girth-diameter cages, for $g \\in \\{4,5\\}$. Moreover, we design and implement an exhaustive graph generation algorithm and use it to determine the exact order of several open cases and obtain -- often exhaustive -- sets of the corresponding girth-diameter cages.

He proved that the pseudocentre of a non-trivial finite group is always non-trivial, giving a new variable on which one can use induction in finite group theory. In the same paper, Wiegold states that no obvious relations seem to hold between the pseudocentre and the canonical characteristic subgroups of a group. The aim of this work is to show that the pseudocentre is indeed much more involved in the structure of an arbitrary group then anyone could have expected. For example, we prove that a soluble group coincides with its pseudocentre if and only if it is abelian, and that the structure of the commutator subgroup strongly influences the structure of the pseudocentre. And this is not the end of the story. In fact, the behaviour of the pseudocentre in arbitrary (possibly infinite) groups can be extremely wild: sometimes it is very difficult even to understand whether the pseudocentre is trivial or not. This wilderness is exampled by some of our main results (see the introduction for a complete list): 1) There exists a polycyclic group of Hirsch length 3 in which the pseudocentre is trivial. 2) The pseudocentre of the group of unitriangular matrices over any field is the largest term of the upper central series that is abelian. 3) Free products have a trivial pseudocentre, but there exist amalgamated free products of non-trivial groups coinciding with their pseudocentre. 4) Weakly regular branch groups have a trivial pseudocentre. 5) The pseudocentre of the Thompson group is the derived subgroup. 6) Wreath products can have a totally arbitrary pseudocentre.",

To get the well-posedness of stochastic curve shortening flow driven by scale-dependent noise, we equivalently formulate the stochastic curve shortening flow as a one-phase stochastic Stefan problem of its curvature parameterized by the arclength parameter and its length. After rewriting the one-phase stochastic Stefan problem as a quasilinear evolution equation, we apply the theory for quaslinear stochastic evolution equations developed by Agresti and Veraar in 2022 to get maximal unique local strong solution for the stochastic curve shortening flow up to a maximal stopping time which is characterized by a blow-up criterion.",

Moreover, we provide detailed analysis of the convergence of these Krylov subspace methods. Specifically, for the symmetric case, we prove the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded in the open interval (1/2, 3/2), which results in a linear convergence rate of the PCG method. For the non-symmetric case, we demonstrate that the PGMRES method also achieves a linear convergence rate independent of discretization stepsizes from the residual point of view. These results imply that the iteration counts of the PCG and PGMRES methods are uniformly bounded and independent of the matrix sizes.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven model for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) stochastic systems by sampling from the conditional probability distribution of future outputs given past input-outputs and future inputs. It operates in a fully behavioral manner, relying solely on the current trajectory and pre-collected input-output data, without requiring explicit identification of system parameters. We refer to this model as a behavioral Conditional Generative Model (CGM). We prove the convergence of the distribution of samples generated by the CGM as the size of the trajectory library increases, with an explicit characterization of the convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gap between the asymptotic distribution of the proposed CGM and the true posterior distribution obtained by Kalman filter, which leverages the knowledge of all system parameters and all historical data, decreases exponentially with respect to the length of past samples. Finally, we integrate this generative model into predictive controllers for stochastic LTI systems. Numerical results verify the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller equipped with the proposed behavioral CGM.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel p-adaptive, high-order mesh-free framework for the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid flows in complex geometries. High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability.",

The model is derived as a gradient flow of an energy functional that approximates the two-phase Canham--Helfrich energy. This leads to a Cahn--Hilliard-type equation with cross diffusion for the relative chemical concentration of one lipid phase, coupled to a fourth-order reaction-diffusion equation describing the height profile of the membrane. We first prove the existence of weak solutions for the case of regular double-well potentials, using a minimizing movement scheme to construct approximate solutions. The analysis is then extended to singular potentials, e.g., the Flory--Huggins potential, by approximating them with a Moreau--Yosida regularization. For both cases, we establish higher regularity, continuous dependence on the initial data, and consequently the uniqueness of weak solutions. Finally, we propose a well-posed finite element discretization of the model and present numerical experiments illustrating the effect of different physical parameters on the resulting membrane patterns. Depending on the parameter regime, we observe purely striped, dotted, or snake-like structures.",

We refer to such maps as {atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type}. In this setting, our main results are: (A) Atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type have locally connected Julia sets; (B) these Julia sets are quasiconformally rigid, i.e., they do not support invariant line fields; (C) any two combinatorially equivalent atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type coincide up to an affine change of coordinates. In particular, item (C) verifies the notorious {Combinatorial Rigidity Conjecture} for atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type and arbitrary degree. By bringing neutral Siegel dynamics into the picture, we extend the celebrated higher-degree rigidity theorems of Avila--Kahn--Lyubich--Shen and Kozlovski--van Strien, which until now applied only in the Yoccoz setting, i.e., for finitely many times renormalizable polynomials without irrationally indifferent periodic points.",

    "abstract": "Isogeometric analysis (IgA) offers enhanced approximation capabilities for the discretization of elliptic boundary-value problems, yet it results in large, sparse, and increasingly ill-conditioned linear systems due to higher interconnectivity among degrees of freedom. In particular, the discretization with tensor-product B-splines or NURBS of degree $p$ on a mesh with $n$ elements per parametric direction leads to symmetric positive-definite systems of the form $K\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{F}$, where the matrix bandwidth and condition number scale unfavorably with both $p$ and spatial dimension $d$. To address the computational challenges posed by such systems, especially in three-dimensional or high-order scenarios, Krylov subspace methods with specialized preconditioners become essential. This paper investigates the efficacy of algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners tailored for IgA-based discretizations, with a focus on performance in modern high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Leveraging the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), we explore distributed-memory and GPU-accelerated strategies for solving large-scale problems. The study assesses algorithmic efficiency and scalability across a range of benchmark tests. The results demonstrate that AMG preconditioners can achieve robust and scalable performance, confirming their potential as practical solvers for large IgA systems in engineering and scientific applications.",

While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.",

To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\\it \\small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\\mathrm{Re}\\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\\mathrm{Re}$. Precisely, we show that if the initial perturbation satisfies $$\\|v_{in}-(y, 0, 0)\\|_{\\tilde{H}(\\mathbb T \\times \\mathbb D)}\\leq \\epsilon_0 \\,\\mathrm{Re}^{-\\alpha},$$ with any $\\alpha>\\frac 23$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6 \\cap W^{3,1}$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}^2$, and with any $\\alpha \\geq\\frac 56$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{T}$, the corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system exists globally in time and remains asymptotically close to the Couette flow. The main analytical challenge arises from the anisotropic nature of the estimates for the zero modes and from the interactions between zero and non-zero modes, which we address using an anisotropic Sobolev space directly tailored to the zero modes. Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold.",

Consequently, the method inherits the convergence properties of the finite element framework under suitable mesh assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm the expected rates of convergence.",

In particular, we prove the existence of normalized solutions for all masses mu in an interval (0, mu_0), under either Navier or Neumann boundary conditions for phi. Moreover, when f is odd, we obtain multiplicity of normalized solutions; and if Omega is star-shaped, we further obtain a normalized ground state solution.",

This condition recovers the result of Hull--Osin on quasimorphisms on hyperbolically embedded subgroups, and the proof given in this paper is much simpler. We also obtain new results for quasimorphisms on normal subgroups. One result is that for a group $G$ and its normal subgroup $K$, if the quotient $G/K$ is hyperbolic, then any antisymmetric quasi-invariant quasimorphism on $K$ extends to $G$. As an application, the stable commutator length $\\mathrm{scl}_G$ is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the stable mixed commutator length $\\mathrm{scl}_{G,K}$ on $[G,K]$. Another result concerns about group-theoretic Dehn filling in the sense of Dahmani--Guirardel--Osin. As an application, the quotient of a mapping class group of a surface with boundary by the normal closure of a large power of a pseudo-Anosov element is hierarchically hyperbolic.

The classical Galois Theory covers the case of finite Galois field extensions. For finite Galois field extensions the objects are their Galois groups and their invariants. In \\cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp}, we introduce a new (ring theoretic) approach to the Galois Theory which is based on the {\\em principle of maximal symmetry}. In \\cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}, the maximal symmetry of {\\em normal} finite field extensions yields an analogue of the Galois Theory for them. For a normal finite field extension $L/K$ the `natural/obvious' objects are the subalgebra $\\CD (L/K)\\rtimes G(L/K)$ of $\\End (L/K)$ that is generated by the automorphism group $G(L/K)$ and the algebra $\\CD (L/K)$ of differential operators on $L/K$ and its `invariants'.

This method employs an alternating iterative scheme, where each iteration entails solving two systems of equations with symmetric real coefficient matrices. This design is intended to reduce the high computational costs associated with complex arithmetic. Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters. When the eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions, the method guarantees convergence for any positive iteration parameter. Building on this insight, we developed the preconditioned lopsided HSS iteration method (PLHSS). Theoretical results demonstrate that PLHSS exhibits superior convergence properties compared to the original method. Additionally, we derived the optimal parameters for the new approaches and corresponding optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we derive the PLHSS preconditioner on the basis of the iterative method. The eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are well-clustered, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with a specific inner product. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioned GMRES and COCG methods. LHSS iteration methods and the relevant preconditioners show mesh size independent and parameter-insensitive convergence behavior for the test numerical examples.",

We introduce Pseudo-Inference Algebras, purely algebraic tructures where the ternary relation is replaced by a monotone ternary operator, capturing the logical character of extended contact. We show that the subclass of relational Pseudo-Inference Algebras corresponds precisely to ECAs and generates a subvariety of strict PSI-Algebras, which forms a discriminator variety. Furthermore, we extend Stone duality to this ternary context, introducing descriptive PSI-frames and establishing three interrelated dualities that differ in their morphisms while sharing the same class of topological objects. The framework developed in the paper provides a nified relational semantics for Boolean algebras equipped with monotone ternary operators, connecting spatial and logical notions within a categorical and topological setting.",

    "abstract": "We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.",

He verified in small cases that their coefficients can be expressed in terms of certain $q$-zeta values and that the polynomials recover the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces studied by Mirzakhani under a certain $q \\to 1$ limit. In this paper, we provide mathematically rigorous proofs of these two phenomena. The authors previously defined natural $q$-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of curves. We prove that these polynomials appear as the top degree part of Okuyama's polynomials.

Taking the reversed point of view, we show that any finite dimensional family of polynomials belonging to the Askey scheme can be interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of an algebra.

Due to the complex nature of the dielectric function, the frequencies are complex, resulting in a decay in time. The geometry is that of a waveguide in $x$ with the propagation direction being $y$ and the solutions are localized in $x$ and TM-polarized. These are often referred to as breathers. They are given as a Fourier series in $y$ and $t$ with the leading frequency $\\omega$ being an eigenvalue of a corresponding operator pencil on $\\mathbb{R}$ (in the $x$ variable). Each term in the series corresponds to a different temporal decay rate or a different frequency. The series is constructed iteratively via a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Our general result provides the existence under some assumptions on the spectrum and on estimates of the resolvent of the corresponding linear operator. We also produce an example of a waveguide given by the interface of two spatially homogeneous physically relevant media for which these assumptions are satisfied. For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons.",

We rigorously derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality as the singular limit of a reaction-diffusion system in the upper half-plane, where the road is modeled as a degenerate one-dimensional medium with enhanced diffusion and tangential drift. By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution. The solution is characterized by a fundamental solution constructed via optimal paths, revealing a critical transition in propagation behavior governed by a geometrically derived curve that separates rectilinear and road-assisted regimes. Our framework extends to non-order-preserving systems where classical comparison methods fail, and we provide a detailed asymptotic derivation of the Wentzell boundary condition from flux continuity principles. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to conical domains with intersecting roads, demonstrating the robustness of our variational methodology. Numerical simulations illustrate how advection and diffusion parameters shape the invaded region, highlighting the interplay between field and road dynamics in determining propagation patterns.",

The polynomials obtained provide a new surprising connection: both the Catalan numbers and generalized Catalan numbers occur among the coefficients, depending on the representation. Since every PTR polynomial has connections with several classes of permutation polynomials, we obtain three new infinite classes of permutation polynomials as a consequence of our main result, and these, too, involve the Catalan numbers.

These models include e.g. branching random walks, embedded complete and incomplete binary trees, random Cayley and plane trees with uniform displacements along edges. Motivated by recent work suggesting a Markovian structure in the vertical profile of such trees, we introduce the vertical edge profile, which counts both oriented edges connecting label $k-1$ to label $k$ and oriented edges connecting label $k$ to label $k-1$. We show that the vertical edge profile forms a time-homogeneous Markov chain for a wide class of models, and this remains true (provided we enrich this process by the total mass of the tree below each label) if we condition on the total size of the tree. We give explicit transition kernels in the case of labelled incomplete binary trees, which are closely related to known enumeration formulas. To establish these results, we study a decomposition of labelled trees into excursions above and below fixed label levels, yielding a forest structure with tractable probabilistic laws. We further explain briefly how these findings connect to the theory of super-Brownian motion and the Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion (ISE). In a companion paper, we show that the vertical edge profile converges, after rescaling,to the local time and its derivative of Brownian motion indexed by the Brownian tree.",

Over the past several decades, three major frameworks have emerged to formalize causal questions and guide their analysis: the potential outcomes framework, structural equation models, and directed acyclic graphs.

This paper provides a comparative introduction to the three frameworks, clarifying their connections, highlighting their distinct strengths and limitations, and illustrating how they can be used together in practice. The discussion is aimed at researchers and graduate students with some background in statistics or causal inference who are seeking a conceptual foundation for applying causal methods across a range of substantive domains.",

The population is modeled as a continuous measure over the preferred times. Every user looks at the time slot that minimizes the sum of the price assigned by the company to this time slot and the distance to their preferred time. If this sum is non-negative, then the user chooses this time slot for getting the service. If this sum is positive, then the user rejects the service. We address the problem of finding prices that ensure that the volume of users choosing each time slot is below capacity, while maximizing the revenue of the company. For the case where the distance function is convex, we propose an exact algorithm for solving this problem in time $O(n^3|P|^3)$, where $P$ is the set of possible prices and $n$ is the number of time slots. For the case where the prices can be any real numbers, this algorithm can also be used to find asymptotically optimal solutions in polynomial time under mild extra assumptions on the distance function and the measure modeling the population.",

It is also completely integrable, belonging to the same hierarchy as the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II (DS II) system. The mNV system is $L^2$ critical. Some time ago, Schottdorf proved that for small $L^2$ initial data, the mNV equation is globally well-posed. In this article, we consider instead the large data problem, using inverse scattering methods. Our main result asserts that the mNV system is globally well-posed for large $L^2$ data, with the solutions scattering as time goes to $\\pm \\infty$. One key ingredient in the proof, which is of independent interest, is a new nonlinear Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for the associated scattering transform. As a byproduct of our main result, we are also able to prove a global well-posedness result for the closely related Novikov-Veselov problem at the critical $\\dot H^{-1} + L^1$ level, for a range of data which can heuristically be described as soliton-free. Here we use the associated Miura map to connect the mNV and the NV flows. In order to characterize the range of the Miura map, we prove another result of independent interest, namely a sharp, scale invariant form of the Agmon-Allegretto-Piepenbrink principle in the critical case of two space dimensions.",

However, these methods require iterative training and depend on an initially admissible policy. This work introduces a new analytical framework that yields closed-form solutions to the HJB equation for a class of continuous-time nonlinear input-affine systems with known dynamics. Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided. The method offers a closed-form control policy derived from the HJB framework, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and optimal performance on state-of-the-art optimal control problems in the literature.",

To fill this gap, we develop valid and sharp confidence sets for kernel instrumental variable regression, allowing general nonlinearities and data types. Computationally, our bootstrap procedure requires only a single run of the kernel instrumental variable regression estimator. Theoretically, it relies on the same key assumptions.

An object of the Configuration, called p-formation, extends the notion of simplicial complex, and a morphism, which expresses the recomposition of the base, extends the notion of simplicial map. An object of the Foundation, called p-site, describes the profile of the polity, that is, how the states of the ground are intertwined between the agents. A morphism between political sites consists of a pair of maps, namely a Base map and a Ground map, satisfying appropriate conditions. Two functors relate the Foundation and the Configuration: the Knit which attributes to each p-site a p-formation and the Nerve which attributes to each p-site a simplicial complex. In the opposite direction a functor, called Canon, which attributes to any p-formation its canonical p-site, turns out to be in an appropriate sense the inverse of the Knit and the Nerve.",

    "abstract": "Given integers $n\\ge s\\ge 2$, let $e(n,s)$ stand for the maximum size of a family of subsets of an $n$-element set that contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint members. The study of this quantity goes back to the 1960s, when Kleitman determined $e(sm-1,s)$ and $e(sm,s)$ for all integer $m,s\\ge 1$. The question of determining $e(n,s)$ is closely connected to its uniform counterpart, the subject of the famous Erdős Matching Conjecture. The problem of determining $e(n,s)$ has proven to be very hard and, in spite of some progress during these years, even a general conjecture concerning the value of $e(n,s)$ is missing. In this paper, we completely solve the problem for $n\\le 3s$. In this regime, the average size of a set in an $s$-matching is at most $3$, and it is a delicate interplay between the `missing' $2$- and $3$-element sets that plays a key role here. Four types of extremal families appear in the characterization. Our result sheds light on how the extremal function $e(n,s)$ may behave in general.",

This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction.

From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class.

    "abstract": "We obtain the first rigorous derivation of an incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent and time-dependent forcing terms from the inelastic hard-spheres Boltzmann equation associated to the relevant case of viscoelastic granular gases. The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, Mémoires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit. The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system obtained by this process appears to be new in this context. As a byproduct of the analysis, we determine the exact dissipation rate of the granular temperature known as \\emph{Haff's law}.",

Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.",

In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent \"ghost\" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity.

The definition relies on constructing a canonical family of bounding cochains that satisfy the point-like condition of the second author and Tukachinsky. Since the Lagrangian is even dimensional, the parameter of the family is odd. Thus, to avoid the vanishing of invariants with more than one boundary constraint, the parameter must be non-commutative. The invariants are defined either when the Lagrangian is a rational cohomology sphere or when the Lagrangian is fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, has dimension $2$ modulo $4$, and its cohomology is that of a sphere aside from degree $1$ modulo $4$. In dimension $2$, these invariants recover Welschinger's invariants. We develop an obstruction theory for the existence and uniqueness of bounding cochains in a Fukaya $A_\\infty$ algebra with non-commutative coefficients. The obstruction classes belong to twisted cohomology groups of the Lagrangian instead of the de Rham cohomology of the commutative setting. A spectral sequence is constructed to compute the twisted cohomology groups. The extension of scalars of an $A_\\infty$ algebra by a non-commutative ring is treated in detail.

The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension.",

During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.",

Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}.

However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.",

    "abstract": "The family of $(k, \\ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \\ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable. We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \\ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.",

    "abstract": "Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions. Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\\% of errors while deferring 34.5\\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.",

This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.",

Treating the Richardson number as a small parameter and recasting the stability problem into an adjoint-residual form, we derive a first-order correction for the eigenvalues using only the neutrally buoyant eigenvalue problem. This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions.",

In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.",

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance.

To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds.

    "abstract": "Response-Adaptive Randomization (RAR) is recognized for its potential to deliver improvements in patient benefit. However, the utility of RAR is contingent on regularization methods to mitigate early instability and preserve statistical integrity. A standard regularization approach is the ''burn-in'' period, an initial phase of equal randomization before treatment allocation adapts based on accrued data. The length of this burn-in is a critical design parameter, yet its selection remains unsystematic and improvised, as no established guideline exists. A poorly chosen length poses significant risks: one that is too short leads to high estimation bias and type-I error rate inflation, while one that is too long impedes the intended patient and power benefits of using adaptation. The challenge of selecting the burn-in generalizes to a fundamental question: what is the statistically appropriate timing for the first adaptation? We introduce the first systematic framework for determining burn-in length. This framework synthesizes core factors - total sample size, problem difficulty, and two novel metrics (reactivity and expected final allocation error) - into a single, principled formula. Simulation studies, grounded in real-world designs, demonstrate that lengths derived from our formula successfully stabilize the trial. The formula identifies a ''sweet spot'' that mitigates type-I error rate inflation and mean-squared error, preserving the advantages of higher power and patient benefit.

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.",

    "title": "Sublinear Time Low-Rank Approximation of Hankel Matrices",
    "abstract": "Hankel matrices are an important class of highly-structured matrices, arising across computational mathematics, engineering, and theoretical computer science. It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\\|H-H_k\\|_F \\leq \\epsilon \\|H\\|_F$ for $k = O(\\log n \\log(1/\\epsilon))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \\emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\\polylog(n, 1/\\epsilon)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\\log n \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ Hankel matrix $\\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \\emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\\|H - \\widehat{H}\\|_F \\leq O(\\|E\\|_F) + \\epsilon \\|H\\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \\emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \\emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.",

To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework.

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics. When $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \\emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes. The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\\\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$ communities.

While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results.

While the qualitative correctness of MCMC algorithms is often easy to ensure, their practical efficiency is contingent on the `target' distribution being reasonably well-behaved. In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies. We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space. In each case, we formulate the pathology in concrete terms, review a range of proposed algorithmic remedies to the pathology, and outline promising directions for future research.",

This paper presents the first unbiased estimator of the effective degrees of freedom for these methods, along with their main theoretical properties, for both orthogonal and non-orthogonal designs, derived within Stein's unbiased risk estimation framework. The resulting expressions feature inflation terms influenced by the regularization parameter, coefficient signs, and least-squares estimates.

Contrary to existing approaches, that assume perfect information or use heuristic maneuver models in stochastic settings, we formulate the problem in an inherently stochastic framework involving imperfect information and bounded controls. Complying with the generalized separation theorem, the control law factors in the posterior distribution of the state. Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer. Monte Carlo simulations show that the TSE strategy outperforms traditional stochastic evasion strategies based on random telegraph, Singer, and weaving models.",

As an application of this result, given a positive integer $t\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$, we prove that there are, for infinitely many pairs of $v$ and $k$, at least $(1-o(1)) \\frac{(\\frac{v-t}{2})!}{\\phi(v)} $ non-isomorphic biembeddings of $K_{\\frac{v}{t}\\times t}$ whose face lengths are multiples of $k$. Here $\\phi(\\cdot)$ denotes the Euler's totient function. Moreover, in case $t=1$ and $v$ is a prime, almost all these embeddings define faces that are all of the same length $kv$, i.e. we have a more than exponential number of non-isomorphic $kv$-gonal biembeddings of $K_{v}$.",

Meanwhile, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan introduced a mathematical theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM), associating a counting theory to a GIT quotient with a super-potential, under suitable assumptions. This paper provides a common generalization of both works, by introducing new stability conditions in the mathematical GLSM. We show that our stability condition guarantees the separatedness and properness of the cosection degeneracy locus in the moduli. It generalizes the MSP fields construction to more general GIT quotients, including Calabi-Yau global complete intersections in toric varieties.

Assuming that the observations are modeled by a Poisson distribution, we are interested in simultaneous testing of whether the mean of the $i^{\\text{th}}$ observation is small or large. In this work, we study some optimal properties (in terms of Bayes risk) of multiple-testing rules when the mean parameter is modeled by both two-group and a general class of one-group shrinkage priors, proposed by Polson and Scott (2010). Here, first, we model each mean by a two-group prior, and under additive $0-1$ loss function, obtain an expression for the optimal Bayes risk under some assumption similar in the spirit of Bogdan et al. (2011). Next, assuming that the observations are truly generated from a two-group mixture model and modelling each mean parameter by the broad class of one-group priors, we study the Bayes risk induced by our chosen class of priors. We have been able to show that, when the underlying level of sparsity is known, under some proposed assumptions, the Bayes risk corresponding to our broad class of priors attains the optimal Bayes risk, upto a multiplicative constant. When this sparsity pattern is unknown, motivated by Yano et al. (2021), we use an empirical Bayes estimate of the global shrinkage parameter. In this case, also, we show that the modified decision rule attains the optimal Bayes risk, upto a multiplicative constant. In this way, as an alternative solution for two-group prior, we propose a broad class of global-local priors having similar optimal properties in terms of Bayes risk for quasi-sparse count data. Finally, the theoretical results are verified using simulation studies followed by a real data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic bilevel optimization (SBO) is becoming increasingly essential in machine learning due to its versatility in handling nested structures. To address large-scale SBO, decentralized approaches have emerged as effective paradigms in which nodes communicate with immediate neighbors without a central server, thereby improving communication efficiency and enhancing algorithmic robustness. However, most decentralized SBO algorithms focus solely on asymptotic convergence rates, overlooking transient iteration complexity-the number of iterations required before asymptotic rates dominate, which results in limited understanding of the influence of network topology, data heterogeneity, and the nested bilevel algorithmic structures. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-SOBA, a Decentralized Stochastic One-loop Bilevel Algorithm framework. D-SOBA comprises two variants: D-SOBA-SO, which incorporates second-order Hessian and Jacobian matrices, and D-SOBA-FO, which relies entirely on first-order gradients. We provide a comprehensive non-asymptotic convergence analysis and establish the transient iteration complexity of D-SOBA. This provides the first theoretical understanding of how network topology, data heterogeneity, and nested bilevel structures influence decentralized SBO. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and theoretical advantages of D-SOBA.",

    "title": "Counting Perfect Matchings In Dirac Hypergraphs",
    "abstract": "One of the foundational theorems of extremal graph theory is Dirac's theorem, which says that if an n-vertex graph G has minimum degree at least n/2, then G has a Hamilton cycle, and therefore a perfect matching (if n is even). Later work by Sárkozy, Selkow and Szemerédi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have many Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler and Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of G). In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in hypergraphs. For positive integers d < k, and for n divisible by k, let $m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect matching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open question to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we are nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing that if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least $(1+\\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\\gamma>0$), then the number of perfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G. This strengthens cruder estimates arising from work of Kang-Kelly-Kühn-Osthus-Pfenninger and Pham-Sah-Sawhney-Simkin.",

    "abstract": "In 1975, Erdős and Sauer asked to estimate, for any constant $r$, the maximum number of edges an $n$-vertex graph can have without containing an $r$-regular subgraph. In a recent breakthrough, Janzer and Sudakov proved that any $n$-vertex graph with no $r$-regular subgraph has at most $C_r n \\log \\log n$ edges, matching an earlier lower bound by Pyber, Rödl and Szemerédi and thereby resolving the Erdős-Sauer problem up to a constant depending on $r$. We prove that every $n$-vertex graph without an $r$-regular subgraph has at most $Cr^2 n \\log \\log n$ edges. This bound is tight up to the value of $C$ for $n\\geq n_0(r)$ and hence resolves the Erdős-Sauer problem up to an absolute constant. Moreover, we obtain similarly tight results for the whole range of possible values of $r$ (i.e., not just when $r$ is a constant), apart from a small error term at a transition point near $r\\approx \\log n$, where, perhaps surprisingly, the answer changes. More specifically, we show that every $n$-vertex graph with average degree at least $\\min(Cr\\log(n/r),Cr^2 \\log\\log n)$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph. The bound $Cr\\log(n/r)$ is tight for $r\\geq \\log n$, while the bound $Cr^2 \\log \\log n$ is tight for $r<(\\log n)^{1-\\Omega(1)}$. These results resolve a problem of Rödl and Wysocka from 1997 for almost all values of $r$. Among other tools, we develop a novel random process that efficiently finds a very nearly regular subgraph in any almost-regular graph. A key step in our proof uses this novel random process to show that every $K$-almost-regular graph with average degree $d$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph for some $r=\\Omega_K(d)$, which is of independent interest.",

In this paper we answer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and using function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is central to this type of approach. From a practical standpoint, we show that our approximation results are robust to input noise, and that function-geometric multifiltrations have good statistical convergence properties. We also provide an algorithm to compute our estimators, and we use its implementation to conduct extensive experiments, on both synthetic and real biological data, in order to validate our theoretical results and to assess the practicality of our approach.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for Lévy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by Lévy noises (RBM-Lévy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-Lévy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-Lévy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the Lévy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the Lévy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.",

Stabilisers of infinite rays are not finitely generated in general, but if the ray is computable, the membership problem is well posed and solvable. The main result of the paper is that, for bounded automata groups, the membership problem in the stabiliser of any ray that is eventually periodic as an infinite word, forms an ET0L language that is constructable. The result is optimal in the sense that, in general, the membership problem for the stabiliser of an infinite ray in a bounded automata group cannot be context-free.

    "title": "A multilevel stochastic regularized first-order method with application to finite sum minimization",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multilevel stochastic framework for the solution of nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems. The proposed approach uses random regularized first-order models that exploit an available hierarchical description of the problem, being either in the classical variable space or in the function space, meaning that different levels of accuracy for the objective function are available. We propose a convergence analysis showing an almost sure global convergence of the method to a first order stationary point. The numerical behavior is tested on the solution of finite sum minimization problems. Differently from classical deterministic multilevel schemes, our stochastic method does not require the finest approximation to coincide with the original objective function along all the optimization process. This allows for significantly decreasing their cost, for instance in data-fitting problems, where considering all the data at each iteration can be avoided.",

    "title": "Nonparametric Regression in Dirichlet Spaces: A Random Obstacle Approach",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider nonparametric estimation over general Dirichlet metric measure spaces. Unlike the more commonly studied reproducing kernel Hilbert space, whose elements may be defined pointwise, a Dirichlet space typically only contain equivalence classes, i.e. its elements are only unique almost everywhere. This lack of pointwise definition presents significant challenges in the context of nonparametric estimation, for example the classical ridge regression problem is ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a new technique for renormalizing the ridge loss by replacing pointwise evaluations with certain \\textit{local means} around the boundaries of obstacles centered at each data point. The resulting renormalized empirical risk functional is well-posed and even admits a representer theorem in terms of certain equilibrium potentials, which are truncated versions of the associated Green function, cut-off at a data-driven threshold. We demonstrate that the renormalized ridge estimator is rate-optimal, and derive an adaptive upper bound on its convergence rate that highlights the interplay between the analytic, geometric, and probabilistic properties of the Dirichlet form. Our framework notably does not require the smoothness of the underlying space, and is applicable to both manifold and fractal settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to obtain optimal, out-of-sample convergence guarantees in the framework of general metric measure Dirichlet spaces.",

    "abstract": "The score function for the diffusion process, also known as the gradient of the log-density, is a basic concept to characterize the probability flow with important applications in the score-based diffusion generative modelling and the simulation of Itô stochastic differential equations. However, neither the probability flow nor the corresponding score function for the diffusion-jump process are known. This paper delivers mathematical derivation, numerical algorithm, and error analysis focusing on the corresponding score function in non-Gaussian systems with jumps and discontinuities represented by the nonlinear Lévy--Fokker--Planck equations. We propose the Lévy score function for such stochastic equations, which features a nonlocal double-integral term, and we develop its training algorithm by minimizing the proposed loss function from samples. Based on the equivalence of the probability flow with deterministic dynamics, we develop a self-consistent score-based transport particle algorithm to sample the interactive Lévy stochastic process at discrete time grid points. We provide error bound for the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the numerical and true probability density functions by overcoming the nonlocal challenges in the Lévy score. The full error analysis with the Monte Carlo error and the time discretization error is furthermore established. To show the usefulness and efficiency of our approach, numerical examples from applications in biology and finance are tested.",

The presented bound is tight whenever the value of the total variation distance is larger than 1/$\\alpha$. By applying these inequalities in a cross-channel setting, we arrive at strong data processing inequalities for $f_\\alpha$-divergence that can be adapted to use-case specific restrictions of input distributions and channel. The application of these results to privacy amplification shows that even very sparse channels can lead to significant privacy amplification when used as a post-processing step after local differentially private mechanisms.",

The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.",

These are a mainstay of solvable lattice models. We will show how the parameter space can sometimes be enlarged to a groupoid, and give two examples of such groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equations, within the six vertex model. A groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation consists of a groupoid $\\mathfrak{G}$ together with a map $\\pi:\\mathfrak{G}\\to\\operatorname{End}(V\\otimes V)$ for some vector space $V$ such that the Yang-Baxter commutator $[[ \\pi(u),\\pi(w),\\pi(v)]]=0$ if $u,v\\in\\mathfrak{G}$ are such that the groupoid composition $w=u\\star v$ is defined. An important role is played by an object map $\\Delta:\\mathfrak{G}\\to M$ for some set $M$ such that $\\Delta(u)=\\Delta(v')$, $\\Delta(w)=\\Delta(v)$ and $\\Delta(w')=\\Delta(u')$, where $v\\mapsto v'$ is the groupoid inverse map. There are two main regimes of the six-vertex model: the free-fermionic point, and everything else. For the free-fermionic point, there exists a parametrized Yang-Baxter equation with a large parameter group $\\operatorname{GL}(2)\\times\\operatorname{GL}(1)$. For non-free-fermionic six-vertex matrices, there are also well-known (group) parametrized Yang-Baxter equations, but these do not account for all possible interactions. Instead we will construct a groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation that accounts for essentially all possible Yang-Baxter equations in the six-vertex model. We will also exhibit a separate groupoid for the five-vertex model. We will show how to construct solvable lattice models based on groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equations.",

    "abstract": "We study a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model that describes the motion of a two-phase flow of two viscous incompressible Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities and a soluble surfactant in a bounded domain of two or three dimensions. The resulting hydrodynamic system consists of a nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system for the (volume averaged) velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ and a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system for the phase-field variables $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ that represent the difference in volume fractions of the binary fluids and the surfactant concentration, respectively. For the initial boundary value problem with physically relevant singular potentials subject to a no-slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase-field variables and the chemical potentials, we first establish the existence of global weak solutions in the case of non-degenerate mobilities based on a suitable semi-implicit time discretization. Next, we prove the existence of global weak solutions for a class of general degenerate mobilities, with the aid of a new type of approximations for both the mobilities and the singular parts of the potential densities.",

We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an original minimax framework for finite-time performance analysis in queueing control and propose a surprisingly simple Lyapunov-based scheduling policy with superior finite-time performance. The framework quantitatively characterizes how the expected total queue length scales with key system parameters, including the capacity of the scheduling set and the variability of arrivals and departures across queues. To our knowledge, this provides the first firm foundation for evaluating and comparing scheduling policies in the finite-time regime, including nonstationary settings, and shows that the proposed policy can provably and empirically outperform classical MaxWeight in finite time. Within this framework, we establish three main sets of results. First, we derive minimax lower bounds on the expected total queue length for parallel-queue scheduling via a novel Brownian coupling argument. Second, we propose a new policy, LyapOpt, which minimizes the full quadratic Lyapunov drift-capturing both first- and second-order terms-and achieves optimal finite-time performance in heavy traffic while retaining classical stability guarantees. Third, we identify a key limitation of the classical MaxWeight policy, which optimizes only the first-order drift: its finite-time performance depends suboptimally on system parameters, leading to substantially larger backlogs in explicitly characterized settings. Together, these results delineate the scope and limitations of classical drift-based scheduling and motivate new queueing-control methods with rigorous finite-time guarantees.",

We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states.

We establish that the maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the two-to-infinity norm empirically has higher power to detect structured alternatives that differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving row-wise matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.",

One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to classical curves are included.",

In particular, in our pathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models and a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC circuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D model consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left ventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this representation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to ventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation compared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D model, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify the parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration process. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic, pulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To maintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy is developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to enhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an accurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of hypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for real-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful insights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone.",

We investigate the Erdős--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Jonathan M. Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\\|\\widehat{E}\\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \\geq 2$, if \\[ |E|\\gg q^{\\min\\left\\{\\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \\frac{d+4}{8s}\\right\\}}, \\] then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. Moreover, our methods give sharp lower bounds for the number of distinct distances determined by two different sets. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \\geq 3$, the often-cited $\\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structures. This provides a clear picture of the spherical distance conjecture.",

We specify an isometric isomorphism theorem, showing that all log-Euclidean metrics on manifolds of identical dimension are isomorphically Riemannian isometric. Explicit isometries are constructed, linking SPD and correlation matrix manifolds. We further characterize quotient log-Euclidean metrics within a principal-bundle framework. We show that for any n $\\ge$ 3, there is no choice of log-Euclidean metrics on S+(n) and on Cor+(n) for which the inclusion i\\,: Cor+(n) $\\rightarrow$ S+(n) becomes an isometric embedding. These results unify several disparate metrics in geometric statistics.",

Although a long-standing open problem, the pulse is well-accepted to often exist based on its original singular construction, closed form when it exists, and follow-ups, but prior to this study, there has not been a proof that overcomes the difficulties of (i) solving for the fast speed and width functions using the implicit function theorem at $\\epsilon=0$ and (ii) tracking the resultant formal homoclinic orbit near its singular orbit during fast, slow, and mixed time scales. First, we provide new, first-order approximations of the pulse speed and width. We then show that the formal pulse is close to the front and back at threshold crossing points and that the Hausdorff distance between the formal pulse and the singular homoclinic orbit converges to zero, demonstrating that the formal pulse is a true solution to the original system. Broadly, our methods provide insight into nonlocal geometric singular perturbation theory.",

We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.",

These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.",

Through a different proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets. Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space. In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.",

In a classical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected subset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or experiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the population is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple comparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in classical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which multiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study questions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized experiments. Finally, we develop new statistical methods for analyzing these Multiple Randomization Designs.",

    "abstract": "The linear noise approximation (LNA) describes the random fluctuations from the mean-field concentrations of a chemical reaction network due to intrinsic noise. It is also used as a test probe to determine the accuracy of reduced formulations of the chemical master equation and to understand the relationship between timescale disparity and model reduction in stochastic environments. Although several reduced LNAs have been proposed, they have not been placed into a general theory concerning the accuracy of reduced LNAs derived from center manifold and singular perturbation theory. This has made it difficult to understand why certain reductions of the master or Langevin equations fail or succeed. In this work, we develop a deeper understanding of slow manifold projection in the linear noise regime by answering a straightforward but open question: In the presence of eigenvalue disparity, does the appropriate oblique projection of the LNA onto the slow eigenspace accurately approximate the first and second moments of complete LNA, and if not, why? Although most studies concentrate on the role of eigenvalue disparity arising from the drift matrix, we go further and examine the interplay between disparate ``drift\" eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix, the latter of which may or may not be disparate. Furthermore, we place the previously established reductions of the LNA into a more general framework and formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the projected LNA to accurately approximate the first and second moments of the complete LNA.",

    "abstract": "Bike-sharing systems (BSS) provide a sustainable urban mobility solution, but ensuring their reliability requires effective rebalancing strategies to address stochastic demand and prevent station imbalances. This paper proposes reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for dynamic rebalancing problem with multiple vehicles, introducing and comparing two RL approaches: Single-policy RL and Dual-policy RL. We formulate this network optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process within a continuous-time framework, allowing vehicles to make independent and cooperative rebalancing decisions without synchronization constraints. In the first approach, a single deep Q-network (DQN) is trained to jointly learn inventory and routing decisions. The second approach decouples node-level inventory decisions from arc-level vehicle routing, enhancing learning efficiency and adaptability. A high-fidelity simulator under the first-arrive-first-serve rule is developed to estimate rewards across diverse demand scenarios influenced by temporal and weather variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while the single-policy model is competitive against several benchmarks, the dual-policy model significantly reduces lost demand. These findings provide valuable insights for bike-sharing operators, reinforcing the potential of RL for real-time rebalancing and paving the way for more adaptive and intelligent urban mobility solutions.",

The following situation is considered: First, it is assumed that the worth of the grand and singleton coalitions are known. It takes some amount of costs to obtain worth of unknown coalitions. If it is performed, then the worth of the grand coalition is decreased by the value of a cost function. With the view point of fairness of a payoff allocation, we should examine coalitional worth as much as possible. However, we should stop examining coalitional worth at some point since total payoff is reduced by continuing the examinations. We name the new decision making problem a partially defined cooperative game with costs. The problem of a partially defined cooperative game with costs is finding the solution of partially defined cooperative games at each point and the best exiting rule of examinations of coalitional worth.",

Existing quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups for the quantum linear system problem (QLSP) in terms of the problem dimension, but the advantage is bottlenecked by condition number of the coefficient matrix. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for QLSP inspired by the classical proximal point algorithm (PPA). Our proposed method can be viewed as a meta-algorithm that allows inverting a modified matrix via an existing \\texttt{QLSP\\_solver}, thereby directly approximating the solution vector instead of approximating the inverse of the coefficient matrix. By carefully choosing the step size $\\eta$, the proposed algorithm can effectively precondition the linear system to mitigate the dependence on condition numbers that hindered the applicability of previous approaches.

We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly. The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.",

Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.",

    "abstract": "We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.",

Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap.

    "abstract": "Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.",

The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.",

A key challenge lies in specifying process and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled, data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.",

This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality.

    "abstract": "In humans and other animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.",

    "abstract": "As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications, but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than existing alternatives, often enough to reveal statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.",

These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. The exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented online without the need for variational techniques. Importantly, the reverse SDEs and corresponding processes are generalizations of their forward counterparts. One can recover the forward process from its reverse, meaning that the reverse process experiences the same decoherence and noise effects as the forward process.

Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.",

In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\\Omega(\\kappa^{3/2}\\epsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $\\Omega(\\kappa^{5/2}\\epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.",

Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",

Effect-based biomonitoring provides a cost-effective solution.

To extend the approach, this proof-of-concept study evaluates the potential to formalize behavioral fingerprints from real-time videotracking data to characterize qualitative variations in effluent contamination. We present the first application of a functional data analysis (FDA) framework in ecotoxicology. Data were obtained by simultaneously tracking three sentinel organisms from distinct taxa (a crustacean, an annelid, and a gastropod) during pulse exposures to four chemicals in the laboratory (two metals, one pharmaceutical, and one insecticide). Individual and multispecies responses were analy-zed to determine whether combining species enhances the resolution of contamination fingerprints through multidimensional FDA. Applying the same data-driven approach to field data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) revealed four recurring types of micropollution events. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of behavioral fingerprints to improve wastewater monitoring and reduce pollutant transfer to the environment.",

Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease.

We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions.

    "abstract": "Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.",

    "abstract": "Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.",

    "abstract": "Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

    "abstract": "The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is the model of choice in statistical genetics to model population ancestries. Software capable of simulating ARGs on a genome scale within a reasonable amount of time are now widely available for most practical use cases. While the inverse problem of inferring ancestries from a sample of haplotypes has seen major progress in the last decade, it does not enjoy the same level of advancement as its counterpart. Up until recently, even moderately sized samples could only be handled using heuristics. In recent years, the possibility of model-based inference for datasets closer to \"real world\" scenarios has become a reality, largely due to the development of threading-based samplers. This article introduces this http URL , a Julia package that has the ability, among other things, to infer ARGs for samples of thousands of human haplotypes of sizes on the order of hundreds of megabases within a reasonable amount of time. On recent hardware, our package is able to infer an ARG for samples of densely haplotyped (over one marker/kilobase) human chromosomes of sizes up to 10000 in well under a day on data simulated by msprime. Scaling up simulation on a compute cluster is straightforward thanks to a strictly single-threaded implementation. While model-based, it does not resort to threading but rather places restrictions on probability distributions typically used in simulation software in order to enforce sample consistency. In addition to being efficient, a strong emphasis is placed on ease of use and integration into the biostatistical software ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks.

    "abstract": "How does the brain know what is out there and what is not? Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear. We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit. These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired.",

We treat motifs as conceptual entities and represent them through learned CAVs in PLM embedding space by training simple linear classifiers to distinguish motif-containing from non-motif sequences. To identify motif occurrences, we extract embeddings for overlapping sequence windows and compute their inner products with motif CAVs. This scoring mechanism quantifies how strongly each sequence region expresses the motif concept and naturally detects multiple instances of the same motif within the same protein. Using a dataset of sixty-nine well-characterized motifs with curated positive and negative examples, our method achieves over 85\\% F1 Score for segments strongly expressing the concept and accurately localizes motif positions across diverse protein families. As each motif is encoded by a single vector, motif detection requires only the pretrained PLM and a lightweight dictionary of CAVs, offering a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for automated sequence annotation.",

Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\\pm 4$~$\\mu$m vs $3.2 \\pm 0.7$~$\\mu$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.",

This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These intrinsically vulnerable nuclei exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001).

It is also used as a test probe to determine the accuracy of reduced formulations of the chemical master equation and to understand the relationship between timescale disparity and model reduction in stochastic environments. Although several reduced LNAs have been proposed, they have not been placed into a general theory concerning the accuracy of reduced LNAs derived from center manifold and singular perturbation theory. This has made it difficult to understand why certain reductions of the master or Langevin equations fail or succeed. In this work, we develop a deeper understanding of slow manifold projection in the linear noise regime by answering a straightforward but open question: In the presence of eigenvalue disparity, does the appropriate oblique projection of the LNA onto the slow eigenspace accurately approximate the first and second moments of complete LNA, and if not, why? Although most studies concentrate on the role of eigenvalue disparity arising from the drift matrix, we go further and examine the interplay between disparate ``drift\" eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix, the latter of which may or may not be disparate. Furthermore, we place the previously established reductions of the LNA into a more general framework and formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the projected LNA to accurately approximate the first and second moments of the complete LNA.",

Our analytics allow us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply.",

    "abstract": "Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently trained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and models -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both neuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically examining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment metric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We present a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision models and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing gaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear regression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes (rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching (unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout training further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within the first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely driven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final task solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of out-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper layers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.",

We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.",

Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "In humans and other animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, poised to transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We dissect how the unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, the reliance on inaccurate scoring functions for validation, and the crucial need for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from mere chemical exploration to the on-demand engineering of novel~therapeutics.",

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.",

Traditional portfolio optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the highly volatile and nonlinear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. To address this, we design an agent that learns continuous trading actions directly from historical market data through interaction with a simulated trading environment. The agent optimizes portfolio weights to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing downside risk and transaction costs. Experimental evaluations on multiple cryptocurrencies demonstrate that the SAC and DDPG agents outperform baseline strategies such as equal-weighted and mean--variance portfolios. The SAC algorithm, with its entropy-regularized objective, shows greater stability and robustness in noisy market conditions compared to DDPG. These results highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning for adaptive and data-driven portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets.",

    "abstract": "In auction markets that are prone to market power abuse, preventive mitigation of bid prices can be applied through automated mitigation procedures (AMP). Despite the widespread application of AMP in US electricity markets, there exists scarce evidence on how firms strategically react to such price-cap-and-penalty regulation: when the price cap rarely leads to penalty mitigation, it is difficult to distinguish whether AMP are an effective deterrent or simply too lax. We investigate their impact on the bids of generation firms, using 2019 data from the New York and New England electricity markets (NYISO, ISO-NE). We employ a regression discontinuity design, which exploits the fact that the price cap with penalty is only activated when a structural index (e.g., congestion, pivotality) exceeds a certain cutoff. By estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of screening activation, we can causally identify successful deterrence of anti-competitive behavior. Around 30-40% of the analyzed bidders per market exhibit a significant strategic response - corresponding to a decrease in maximum bid prices of 4-10 $/MWh to avoid the penalty. However, there is significant heterogeneity between firms, and the regulatory impact on the overall market is not statistically detectable, suggesting lax mitigation thresholds. Using a merit-order simulation, we estimate the welfare impact of more stringent thresholds to lie between 350 and 980 thousand dollars of increased buyer surplus per mitigated hour, with the associated number of mitigated hours being below 33 hours/year. Our results motivate the empirical calibration of mitigation thresholds to improve the efficiency of AMP regulation.",

    "abstract": "In incomplete financial markets, pricing and hedging European options lack a unique no-arbitrage solution due to unhedgeable risks. This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs. This work advances machine learning applications in quantitative finance by integrating boundary constraints, offering a practical tool for pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.",

Often, other agents on the contestant's team (e.g., a coach of an athlete) or a company (a manager of an R\\&D engineer) have a vested interest in outcomes and can influence the cheating decision. An agency problem arises when only the contestant faces the penalties for cheating. Our theoretical framework examines joint liability, i.e., shifting some responsibility from the contestant to the other agent, as a solution to this agency problem. Equilibrium analysis shows that extending liability reduces cheating if fines are harsh. Less intuitively, when fines are lenient, a shift in liability can lead to an increase in equilibrium cheating rates. Experimental tests confirm that joint liability is effective in reducing cheating if fines are high. However, the predicted detrimental effect of joint liability for low fines does not occur.",

    "abstract": "Classical correlation matrices capture only linear and pairwise co-movements, leaving higher-order, nonlinear, and state-dependent interactions of financial markets unrepresented. This paper introduces the Quantum Network of Assets (QNA), a density-matrix based framework that embeds cross-asset dependencies into a quantum-information representation. The approach does not assume physical quantum effects but uses the mathematical structure of density operators, entropy, and mutual information to describe market organisation at a structural level. Within this framework we define two structural measures: the Entanglement Risk Index (ERI), which summarises global non-separability and the compression of effective market degrees of freedom, and the Quantum Early-Warning Signal (QEWS), which tracks changes in entropy to detect latent information build-up. These measures reveal dependency geometry that classical covariance-based tools cannot capture. Using NASDAQ-100 data from 2024-2025, we show that quantum entropy displays smoother evolution and clearer regime distinctions than classical entropy, and that ERI rises during periods of structural tightening even when volatility remains low. Around the 2025 US tariff announcement, QEWS shows a marked pre-event increase in structural tension followed by a sharp collapse after the announcement, indicating that structural transitions can precede price movements without implying predictive modelling. QNA therefore provides a structural diagnostic of market fragility, regime shifts, and latent information flow. The framework suggests new directions for systemic risk research by linking empirical asset networks with tools from quantum information theory.",

Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses how the growing availability of working from home (WFH) shapes office employees' preferences to move to the suburbs and pinpoints the socio-economic factors that drive those intentions. We focus on Poland, where the housing market is shaped by exceptionally high home-ownership rates and specific suburbanisation patterns. We surveyed city-dwelling office employees (living in municipalities of 100,000 or more) to gauge their willingness to relocate. Logistic-regression estimates then linked those intentions to respondents' demographics, job attributes, commuting patterns, and self-reported productivity shifts under WFH. The study tests three mechanisms. Commuting cost is proxied by travel mode and one-way time; life-course triggers by age, children, and tenure; and job-demands/resources by self-rated productivity under WFH. Sector and city size serve as contextual controls. Linking variables to theory in this way clarifies how the forthcoming results adjudicate among competing explanations. The results indicate that age, commuting mode, self-assessed productivity changes, and employment sector (private versus public) markedly influence the likelihood of considering a move to the suburbs in response to remote-work options. Contrary to expectations, household size, measured by number of children, does not play a significant role. Overall, the evidence suggests that remote work, especially in hybrid form, could become an additional catalyst for suburban expansion in markets characterised by scarce affordable rentals and a strong preference for home ownership, such as Poland.",

We extract the optimal sandwich amount, revealing that their proliferation in new tokens stems from higher profitability in low-liquidity pools.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates optimal execution strategies in intraday energy markets through a mutually exciting Hawkes process model. Calibrated to data from the German intraday electricity market, the model effectively captures key empirical features, including intra-session volatility, distinct intraday market activity patterns, and the Samuelson effect as gate closure approaches. By integrating a transient price impact model with a bivariate Hawkes process to model the market order flow, we derive an optimal trading trajectory for energy companies managing large volumes, accounting for the specific trading patterns in these markets. A back-testing analysis compares the proposed strategy against standard benchmarks such as Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), demonstrating substantial cost reductions across various hourly trading products in intraday energy markets.",

    "abstract": "Using monthly Patreon earnings, we quantify how platform attention algorithms shape earnings concentration across creator economies. Patreon is a tool for creators to monetize additional content from loyal subscribers but offers little native distribution, so its earnings proxy well for the attention creators capture on external platforms (Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and ``Patreon-only''). Fitting power-law tails to test for a highly unequal earnings distribution, we have three key findings. First, across years and platforms the earnings tail and distribution exhibits a Pareto exponent around $\\alpha \\approx 2$, closer to concentrated capital income than to labor income and consistent with a compounding, ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Second, when algorithms tilt more attention toward the top, the gains are drawn disproportionately from the creator ``middle class''. Third, over time, creator inequality across social media platforms converge toward similarly heavy-tailed (and increasingly concentrated) distributions, plausibly as algorithmic recommendations rises in importance relative to user-filtered content via the social graph. While our Patreon-sourced data represents a small subset of total creator earnings on these platforms, it provides unique insight into the cross-platform algorithmic effects on earnings concentration.",

This paper moves beyond traditional stock market indices to examine cross-sectional return distributions-15 in our empirical application, each representing a distinct global market. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting an overlooked policy transmission. This framework enables conditional forecasting, equipping policymakers with a flexible tool to assess macro-financial linkages under different economic scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Conventional models of matching markets assume that monetary transfers can clear markets by compensating for utility differentials. However, empirical patterns show that such transfers often fail to close structural preference gaps. This paper introduces a market microstructure framework that models matching decisions as a limit order book system with rigid bid ask spreads. Individual preferences are represented by a latent preference state matrix, where the spread between an agent's internal ask price (the unconditional maximum) and the market's best bid (the reachable maximum) creates a structural liquidity constraint. We establish a Threshold Impossibility Theorem showing that linear compensation cannot close these spreads unless it induces a categorical identity shift. A dynamic discrete choice execution model further demonstrates that matches occur only when the market to book ratio crosses a time decaying liquidity threshold, analogous to order execution under inventory pressure. Numerical experiments validate persistent slippage, regional invariance of preference orderings, and high tier zero spread executions. The model provides a unified microstructure explanation for matching failures, compensation inefficiency, and post match regret in illiquid order driven environments.",

    "abstract": "Seat belt use remains one of the most effective measures for reducing vehicle occupant fatalities and injuries. Yet, seat-belt compliance across different locales demands far more granular data than traditional, roadside surveys can provide. These surveys are spatially sparse, temporally intermittent, and costly to administer, often providing coarse-grained snapshots insufficient for capturing dynamic behavioral patterns or localized disparities. Telematics data emerges as a transformative alternative, offering continuous, high-resolution driver event records, such as seat belt latch status, across vast geographic areas. This granular and scalable data enables the application of advanced spatiotemporal models that more accurately reflect the complex interactions driving seatbelt use. This study utilizes telematics data to generate county-level seat belt compliance metrics for Iowa in 2022, employing a suite of beta-regression models that incorporate spatial and temporal random effects. The study findings demonstrate that models including both spatial and temporal components outperform those with spatial or temporal effects alone, underscoring the importance of jointly accounting for geographic clustering and temporal dynamics. Among explanatory variables, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and per capita income emerge as significant predictors of compliance rates. The significant spatial and temporal effects highlight that telematics-based granular data substantially enhances model fit and inference quality. The results demonstrate that integrating granular telematics data within sophisticated spatiotemporal frameworks significantly improves inference, providing policymakers with precise insights for targeted interventions and advancing traffic safety research.",

While frequentist approaches are standard practice for CRT analysis, Bayesian methods have emerged as a strong alternative. Previous work has investigated the use of Bayesian hierarchical models for continuous, binary, and count outcomes in CRTs, but these approaches focus on model-based treatment effect coefficients as the target estimands, which may have ambiguous interpretation under model misspecification and informative cluster size. In this article, we introduce a calibrated Bayesian procedure for estimand-aligned analysis of CRTs even in the presence of potentially misspecified models. We propose estimators targeting both the cluster-average treatment effect (cluster-ATE) and individual-average treatment effect (individual-ATE), particularly in scenarios with informative cluster sizes. We additionally explore strategies for summarizing the posterior samples that can achieve the frequentist coverage guarantee even under working model misspecification. We provide simulation evidence to demonstrate the model-robustness property of the proposed Bayesian estimators in CRTs, and further investigate the impact of covariate adjustment as well as the use of more flexible Bayesian nonparametric working models.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.",

We propose a Gaussian copulabased framework for VFL data privatization under missingness constraints, which requires no prior specification of downstream analysis tasks and imposes no restriction on the number of analyses. To privately estimate copula parameters, we introduce a debiased randomized response mechanism for correlation matrix estimation from perturbed ranks, together with a nonparametric privatized marginal estimation that yields consistent CDFs even under MAR. The proposed methods comprise VCDS for MCAR data, EVCDS for MAR data, and IEVCDS, which iteratively refines copula parameters to mitigate MAR-induced bias. Notably, EVCDS and IEVCDS also apply under MCAR, and the framework accommodates mixed data types, including discrete variables. Theoretically, we introduce the notion of Vertical Distributed Attribute Differential Privacy (VDADP), tailored to the VFL setting, establish corresponding privacy and utility guarantees, and investigate the utility of privatized data for GLM coefficient estimation and variable selection. We further establish asymptotic properties including estimation and variable selection consistency for VFL-GLMs. Extensive simulations and a real-data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Across many disciplines, causal inference often relies on randomized experiments with binary outcomes. In such experiments, the Fisher randomization test provides exact, assumption-free tests for causal effects. Sometimes the outcomes are sensitive and must be kept confidential, for example, when they comprise physical or mental health measurements. Releasing test statistics or p-values computed with the confidential outcomes can leak information about the individuals in the study. Those responsible for sharing the analysis results may wish to bound this information leakage, which they can do by ensuring the released outputs satisfy differential privacy. In this article, we develop and compare several differentially private versions of the Fisher randomization test for binary outcomes. Specifically, we consider direct perturbation approaches that inject calibrated noise into test statistics or p-values, as well as a mechanism-aware, Bayesian denoising framework that explicitly models the privacy mechanism. We further develop decision-making procedures under privacy constraints, including a Bayes risk-optimal rule and a frequentist-calibrated significance test. Through theoretical results, simulation studies, and an application to the ADAPTABLE clinical trial, we demonstrate that our methods can achieve valid and interpretable causal inference while ensuring the differential privacy guarantee.",

We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $\\epsilon$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $c\\epsilon^{-\\gamma}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $\\gamma>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.",

Unlike adversarial distribution shift frameworks that yield conservative worst-case guarantees, RUPs induce dataset-level variance inflation rather than systematic bias. We provide examples of RUPs and show that this distributional uncertainty reduces the effective sample size to $n_{\\mathrm{eff}} = n/(1 + n \\tau)$, where $\\tau\\in [0,1]$ quantifies the perturbation strength. For local polynomial estimators, we derive an extended bias-variance decomposition that includes a distributional variance term with the same bandwidth scaling as classical sampling variance. This leads to a modified bandwidth selection principle: when distributional uncertainty dominates sampling uncertainty ($\\tau \\gg 1/n$), optimal bandwidths scale as $\\tau^{1/(2\\beta+1)}$ rather than the usual $n^{-1/(2\\beta+1)}$, where $\\beta$ indicates the smoothness of the function class considered. We also establish matching minimax lower bounds showing that there exists an RUP for which this effective sample size $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is fundamental.

We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions. Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\\% of errors while deferring 34.5\\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives.

Standard approaches typically assume that the cause of failure is missing at random (MAR), an assumption that is generally untestable and frequently implausible in observational studies. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis framework for the proportional cause-specific hazards model that accommodates missing-not-at-random (MNAR) scenarios. A sensitivity parameter is used to quantify the association between missingness and the unobserved cause of failure. Regression coefficients are estimated as functions of this parameter, and a simultaneous confidence band is constructed via a wild bootstrap procedure. This allows identification of a range of MNAR scenarios for which effects remain statistically significant; we refer to this range as a robustness interval. The validity of the proposed approach is justified both theoretically, via empirical process theory, and empirically, through simulation studies. We apply the method to the analysis of data from an HIV cohort study in sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial proportion of causes of failure are missing and the MAR assumption is implausible. The analysis shows that key findings regarding risk factors for care interruption and mortality are robust across a broad spectrum of MNAR scenarios, underscoring the method's utility in situations with MNAR causes of failure.",

We propose a general causal framework for such semi-continuous exposures, together with a novel two-stage estimation strategy. A two-part propensity structure is introduced for the semi-continuous exposure, with one component for exposure status (exposed vs unexposed) and another for the exposure level among those exposed, and incorporates both into a marginal structural model that disentangles the effects of exposure status and dose. The two-stage procedure sequentially targets the causal dose-response among exposed individuals and the causal effect of exposure status at a reference dose, allowing flexibility in the choice of propensity score methods in the second stage. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality for the resulting estimators, and characterise their limiting values under misspecification of the propensity score models. Simulation studies evaluate finite sample performance and robustness, and an application to a study of prenatal alcohol exposure and child cognition demonstrates how the proposed methods can be used to address a range of scientific questions about both exposure status and exposure intensity.",

    "abstract": "Background: True cognitive longitudinal decline can be obscured by repeated testing, which is called practice effects (PEs). We developed a modeling framework that aligns participants by baseline and estimates visit-specific PEs independently of age-related change. Method: Using real data ($N=175$), we estimated within-subject correlations via linear mixed-effects modeling and applied these parameters to simulate longitudinal trajectories for healthy controls (HC) and individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). Simulations incorporated aging, diagnostic differences, and cumulative PE indicators. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were fit with and without PEs to compare model performance. Results: Models that ignored PEs inflated estimates of cognitive stability and attenuated HC--SZ group differences. Including visit-specific PEs improved recovery of true trajectories and more accurately distinguished aging effects from learning-related gains. Interaction models further identified that PEs may differ by diagnosis or by age at baseline. Conclusion: Practice effects meaningfully bias longitudinal estimates if left unmodeled. The proposed alignment-based GEE framework provides a principled method to estimate PEs and improves accuracy in both simulated and real-world settings.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets across various scientific domains has created a pressing need for new statistical methods to compare distributions supported on their underlying structures. Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches.",

We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.",

We express each non-linear function through a basis expansion, and derive a maximum likelihood estimator with a group l0-regularization that penalizes the number of edges in the graph. The resulting estimator is formulated through a convex mixed-integer program, enabling the use of branch-and-bound methods to obtain a solution that is guaranteed to be accurate up to a pre-specified optimality gap. Our formulation can naturally encode background knowledge, such as the presence or absence of edges and partial order constraints among the variables. We establish consistency guarantees for our estimator in terms of graph recovery, even when the number of variables grows with the sample size. Additionally, by connecting the optimality guarantees with our statistical error bounds, we derive an early stopping criterion that allows terminating the branch-and-bound procedure while preserving consistency. Compared with existing approaches that either assume equal error variances, restrict to linear structural equation models, or rely on heuristic procedures, our method enjoys both optimization and statistical guarantees. Extensive simulations and real-data analysis show that the proposed method achieves markedly better graph recovery performance.",

Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity.

Monitoring their financial performance and discovering relevant covariates are essential for risk assessment, business planning, and policy formulation. This paper focuses on predicting profits for SMEs. Two major challenges are faced in this study: 1) SMEs data are stored across different institutions, and centralized analysis is restricted due to data security concerns; 2) data from various institutions contain different levels of missing values, resulting in a complex missingness issue. To tackle these issues, we introduce an innovative approach named Vertical Federated Expectation Maximization (VFEM), designed for federated learning under a missing data scenario. We embed a new EM algorithm into VFEM to address complex missing patterns when full dataset access is unfeasible. Furthermore, we establish the linear convergence rate for the VFEM and establish a statistical inference framework, enabling covariates to influence assessment and enhancing model interpretability. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to validate its finite sample performance. Finally, we thoroughly investigate a real-life profit prediction problem for SMEs using VFEM. Our findings demonstrate that VFEM provides a promising solution for addressing data isolation and missing values, ultimately improving the understanding of SMEs' financial performance.",

    "abstract": "A/B testing plays a central role in data-driven product development, guiding launch decisions for new features and designs. However, treatment effect estimates are often noisy due to short horizons, early stopping, and slowly accumulating long-tail metrics, making early conclusions unreliable. A natural remedy is to pool information across related experiments, but naive pooling potentially fails: within experiments, treatment effects may evolve over time, so mixing early and late outcomes without accounting for nonstationarity induces bias; across experiments, heterogeneity in product, user population, or season dilutes the signal with unrelated noise. These issues highlight the need for pooling strategies that adapt to both temporal evolution and cross-experiment variability. To address these challenges, we propose a local empirical Bayes framework that adapts to both temporal and cross-experiment heterogeneity. Throughout an experiment's timeline, our method builds a tailored comparison set: time-aware within the experiment to respect nonstationarity, and context-aware across experiments to draw only from comparable counterparts. The estimator then borrows strength selectively from this set, producing stabilized treatment effect estimates that remain sensitive to both time dynamics and experimental context. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we show that the proposed local pooling strategy consistently outperforms global pooling by reducing variance while avoiding bias. Our proposed framework enhances the reliability of A/B testing under practical constraints, thereby enabling more timely and informed decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Response-Adaptive Randomization (RAR) is recognized for its potential to deliver improvements in patient benefit. However, the utility of RAR is contingent on regularization methods to mitigate early instability and preserve statistical integrity. A standard regularization approach is the ''burn-in'' period, an initial phase of equal randomization before treatment allocation adapts based on accrued data. The length of this burn-in is a critical design parameter, yet its selection remains unsystematic and improvised, as no established guideline exists. A poorly chosen length poses significant risks: one that is too short leads to high estimation bias and type-I error rate inflation, while one that is too long impedes the intended patient and power benefits of using adaptation. The challenge of selecting the burn-in generalizes to a fundamental question: what is the statistically appropriate timing for the first adaptation? We introduce the first systematic framework for determining burn-in length. This framework synthesizes core factors - total sample size, problem difficulty, and two novel metrics (reactivity and expected final allocation error) - into a single, principled formula. Simulation studies, grounded in real-world designs, demonstrate that lengths derived from our formula successfully stabilize the trial. The formula identifies a ''sweet spot'' that mitigates type-I error rate inflation and mean-squared error, preserving the advantages of higher power and patient benefit. This framework moves researchers from conjecture toward a systematic, reliable approach.",

    "abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a popular technique for performing inference in state-space models (SSMs), particularly when the dynamic process is high-dimensional. Unlike reweighting methods such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, i.e. particle filters), the EnKF leverages either the linear Gaussian structure of the SSM or an approximation thereof, to maintain diversity of the sampled latent states (the so-called ensemble members) via shifting-based updates. Joint parameter and state inference using an EnKF is typically achieved by augmenting the state vector with the static parameter. In this case, it is assumed that both parameters and states follow a linear Gaussian state-space model, which may be unreasonable in practice. In this paper, we combine the reweighting and shifting methods by replacing the particle filter used in the SMC^2 algorithm of Chopin et al., with the ensemble Kalman filter. Hence, parameter particles are weighted according to the estimated observed-data likelihood from the latest observation computed by the EnKF, and particle diversity is maintained via a resample-move step that targets the marginal parameter posterior under the EnKF. Extensions to the resulting algorithm are proposed, such as the use of a delayed acceptance kernel in the rejuvenation step and incorporation of nonlinear observation models. We illustrate the resulting methodology via several applications.",

When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics. When $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \\emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes. The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\\\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$ communities.

Unlike most of the existing literature, we allow for the presence of unmeasured confounding, and show that the combination of interference and unmeasured confounding is a notable challenge to causal inference.

At the same time, SVC models have the advantage that they are easily interpretable. They offer a flexible framework for understanding how the relationships between dependent and independent variables vary across space. The most common methods for modelling such data are the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Bayesian Gaussian Process (Bayes-GP). The Bayesian SVC model, which assumes that the coefficients follow Gaussian processes, provides a rigorous approach to account for spatial non-stationarity. However, the computational cost of Bayes-GP models can be prohibitively high when dealing with large datasets or/and when using a large number of covariates, due to the repeated inversion of dense covariance matrices required at each Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration. In this study, we propose an efficient Bayes-GP modeling framework leveraging the Vecchia approximation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed method is applied to a challenging soil pollution data set in Toulouse, France, characterized by a high degree of censorship (two-thirds censored observations) and spatial clustering.

In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies. We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space.

Although a closed-form estimator is available for the Lasso penalty, adaptive extensions of widely used penalized approaches, including the Adaptive Lasso and Adaptive Group Lasso, have remained without analogous theoretical characterization. This paper presents the first unbiased estimator of the effective degrees of freedom for these methods, along with their main theoretical properties, for both orthogonal and non-orthogonal designs, derived within Stein's unbiased risk estimation framework. The resulting expressions feature inflation terms influenced by the regularization parameter, coefficient signs, and least-squares estimates. These advances enable more accurate model selection criteria and unbiased prediction error estimates, illustrated through synthetic and real data. These contributions offer a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding model complexity in adaptive regression, bridging a critical gap between theory and practice.",

    "abstract": "Instrumental variable regression is a foundational tool for causal analysis across the social and biomedical sciences. Recent advances use kernel methods to estimate nonparametric causal relationships, with general data types, while retaining a simple closed-form expression. Empirical researchers ultimately need reliable inference on causal estimates; however, uniform confidence sets for the method remain unavailable. To fill this gap, we develop valid and sharp confidence sets for kernel instrumental variable regression, allowing general nonlinearities and data types. Computationally, our bootstrap procedure requires only a single run of the kernel instrumental variable regression estimator. Theoretically, it relies on the same key assumptions. Overall, we provide a practical procedure for inference that substantially increases the value of kernel methods for causal analysis.",

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.",

To help guide a wide variety of users, we present a new, open source, web-based, geospatial visualization tool, Exploropleth, that lets users interact with a catalog of established data binning methods, and subsequently compare, customize, and export custom maps. This tool advances the state of the art by providing multiple binning methods in one view and supporting administrative unit reclassification on-the-fly. We interviewed 16 cartographers and geographic information systems (GIS) experts from 13 government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and federal agencies who identified opportunities to integrate Exploropleth into their existing mapmaking workflow, and found that the tool has potential to educate students as well as mapmakers with varying levels of experience.

    "abstract": "Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models. In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost. We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.",

We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.",

Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \\textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes.

This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs. This work advances machine learning applications in quantitative finance by integrating boundary constraints, offering a practical tool for pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.",

    "abstract": "State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator. In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.",

    "abstract": "We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.",

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical.

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.",

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.",

While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.",

While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results.

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a new class of experimental designs. In a classical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected subset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or experiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the population is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple comparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in classical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which multiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study questions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized experiments. Finally, we develop new statistical methods for analyzing these Multiple Randomization Designs.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an emerging distributed machine learning framework aiming at protecting data privacy. Data heterogeneity is one of the core challenges in federated learning, which could severely degrade the convergence rate and prediction performance of deep neural networks. To address this issue, we develop a novel personalized federated learning framework for heterogeneous data, which we refer to as FedSplit. This modeling framework is motivated by the finding that, data in different clients contain both common knowledge and personalized knowledge. Then the hidden elements in each neural layer can be split into the shared and personalized groups. With this decomposition, a novel objective function is established and optimized. We demonstrate FedSplit enjoyers a faster convergence speed than the standard federated learning method both theoretically and empirically. The generalization bound of the FedSplit method is also studied. To practically implement the proposed method on real datasets, factor analysis is introduced to facilitate the decoupling of hidden elements. This leads to a practically implemented model for FedSplit and we further refer to as FedFac. We demonstrated by simulation studies that, using factor analysis can well recover the underlying shared/personalized decomposition. The superior prediction performance of FedFac is further verified empirically by comparison with various state-of-the-art federated learning methods on several real datasets.",

Assuming that the observations are modeled by a Poisson distribution, we are interested in simultaneous testing of whether the mean of the $i^{\\text{th}}$ observation is small or large. In this work, we study some optimal properties (in terms of Bayes risk) of multiple-testing rules when the mean parameter is modeled by both two-group and a general class of one-group shrinkage priors, proposed by Polson and Scott (2010). Here, first, we model each mean by a two-group prior, and under additive $0-1$ loss function, obtain an expression for the optimal Bayes risk under some assumption similar in the spirit of Bogdan et al. (2011). Next, assuming that the observations are truly generated from a two-group mixture model and modelling each mean parameter by the broad class of one-group priors, we study the Bayes risk induced by our chosen class of priors. We have been able to show that, when the underlying level of sparsity is known, under some proposed assumptions, the Bayes risk corresponding to our broad class of priors attains the optimal Bayes risk, upto a multiplicative constant. When this sparsity pattern is unknown, motivated by Yano et al. (2021), we use an empirical Bayes estimate of the global shrinkage parameter. In this case, also, we show that the modified decision rule attains the optimal Bayes risk, upto a multiplicative constant. In this way, as an alternative solution for two-group prior, we propose a broad class of global-local priors having similar optimal properties in terms of Bayes risk for quasi-sparse count data.

However, addressing prospective distributional heterogeneity and ensuring communication efficiency pose significant challenges on distributed statistical analysis. In this article, we focus on integrative estimation of distributed heterogeneous precision matrices, a crucial task related to joint precision matrix estimation where computation-efficient algorithms and statistical optimality theories are still underdeveloped. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel HEterogeneity-adjusted Aggregating and Thresholding (HEAT) approach for distributed integrative estimation. HEAT is designed to be both communication- and computation-efficient, and we demonstrate its statistical optimality by establishing the convergence rates and the corresponding minimax lower bounds under various integrative losses. To enhance the optimality of HEAT, we further propose an iterative HEAT (IteHEAT) approach. By iteratively refining the higher-order errors of HEAT estimators through multi-round communications, IteHEAT achieves geometric contraction rates of convergence. Extensive simulations and real data applications validate the numerical performance of HEAT and IteHEAT methods.",

We evaluated the performance of our method through comprehensive simulation studies across various randomized clinical trial (RCT) settings. Additionally, we demonstrated its application in a large RCT for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a polygenic progressive eye disease, to estimate the HTE of an antioxidant and mineral supplement on time-to-AMD progression and to identify genetics-based subgroups with enhanced treatment effects.

We explore the relationship between these metrics, forecast accuracy, and the similarity of errors, both analytically and through simulations. We illustrate this measure of the value a component model adds to an ensemble in the presence of other models using US COVID-19 death probabilistic forecasts.

Unlike the more commonly studied reproducing kernel Hilbert space, whose elements may be defined pointwise, a Dirichlet space typically only contain equivalence classes, i.e. its elements are only unique almost everywhere. This lack of pointwise definition presents significant challenges in the context of nonparametric estimation, for example the classical ridge regression problem is ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a new technique for renormalizing the ridge loss by replacing pointwise evaluations with certain \\textit{local means} around the boundaries of obstacles centered at each data point. The resulting renormalized empirical risk functional is well-posed and even admits a representer theorem in terms of certain equilibrium potentials, which are truncated versions of the associated Green function, cut-off at a data-driven threshold. We demonstrate that the renormalized ridge estimator is rate-optimal, and derive an adaptive upper bound on its convergence rate that highlights the interplay between the analytic, geometric, and probabilistic properties of the Dirichlet form. Our framework notably does not require the smoothness of the underlying space, and is applicable to both manifold and fractal settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to obtain optimal, out-of-sample convergence guarantees in the framework of general metric measure Dirichlet spaces.",

    "abstract": "A holobiont is made up of a host organism together with its microbiota. In the context of animal breeding, the holobiont can be viewed as the single unit upon which selection operates. Therefore, integrating microbiota data into genomic prediction models may be a promising approach to improve predictions of phenotypic and genetic values. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of hologenomic transgenerational data to address this hypothesis, and thus to fill this gap, we propose a new simulation framework. Our approach, an R Implementation of a Transgenerational Hologenomic Model-based Simulator (RITHMS) is an open-source package. It builds upon simulated transgenerational genotypes from the Modular Breeding Program Simulator (MoBPS) package and incorporates distinctive characteristics of the microbiota, notably vertical and horizontal transmission as well as modulation due to the environment and host genetics. In addition, RITHMS can account for a variety of selection strategies and is adaptable to different genetic architectures. We simulated transgenerational hologenomic data using RITHMS under a wide variety of scenarios, varying heritability, microbiability, and microbiota transmissibility. We found that simulated data accurately preserved key characteristics across generations, notably microbial diversity metrics, exhibited the expected behavior in terms of correlation between taxa and of modulation of vertical and horizontal transmission, response to environmental effects and the evolution of phenotypic values depending on selection strategy. Our results support the relevance of our simulation framework and illustrate its possible use for building a selection index balancing genetic gain and microbial diversity and for evaluating the impact of partially observed microbiota data. RITHMS is an advanced, flexible tool for generating transgenerational hologenomes under selection that incorporate the complex interplay between genetics, microbiota and environment.",

The former is also referred to as hypothesis-generating or data-contingent research, while the latter is also called hypothesis-testing research. In the context of empirical methodological research in statistics, however, the exploratory-confirmatory distinction has received very little attention so far. Our paper aims to fill this gap. First, we revisit the concept of empirical methodological research through the lens of the exploratory-confirmatory distinction. Second, we examine current practice with respect to this distinction through a literature survey including 115 articles from the field of biostatistics. Third, we provide practical recommendations toward a more appropriate design, interpretation, and reporting of empirical methodological research in light of this distinction. In particular, we argue that both modes of research are crucial to methodological progress, but that most published studies -- even if sometimes disguised as confirmatory -- are essentially exploratory in nature. We emphasize that it may be adequate to consider empirical methodological research as a continuum between \"pure\" exploration and \"strict\" confirmation, recommend transparently reporting the mode of conducted research within the spectrum between exploratory and confirmatory, and stress the importance of study protocols written before conducting the study, especially in confirmatory methodological research.",

Bayesian decision procedures provide a formal and intuitive framework for early stopping using posterior and posterior predictive probabilities. Design parameters including decision thresholds and sample sizes are chosen to control the error probabilities associated with the sequential decision process. These choices are routinely made based on estimating the sampling distribution of posterior summaries via intensive Monte Carlo simulation for each sample size and design scenario considered. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to assess error probabilities and determine optimal sample sizes and decision thresholds for Bayesian group sequential designs. We prove theoretical results that enable posterior and posterior predictive probabilities to be modeled as a function of the sample size. Using these functions, we assess error probabilities at a range of sample sizes given simulations conducted at only two sample sizes.

    "abstract": "Missingness in variables that define study eligibility criteria is a seldom addressed challenge in electronic health record (EHR)-based settings. It is typically the case that patients with incomplete eligibility information are excluded from analysis without consideration of (implicit) assumptions that are being made, leaving study conclusions subject to potential selection bias. In an effort to ascertain eligibility for more patients, researchers may look back further in time prior to study baseline, and in using outdated values of eligibility-defining covariates may inappropriately be including individuals who, unbeknownst to the researcher, fail to meet eligibility at baseline. To the best of our knowledge, however, very little work has been done to mitigate these concerns. We propose a robust and efficient estimator of the causal average treatment effect on the treated, defined in the study eligible population, in cohort studies where eligibility-defining covariates are missing at random. The approach facilitates the use of flexible machine-learning strategies for component nuisance functions while maintaining appropriate convergence rates for valid asymptotic inference.

    "abstract": "Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g., single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies, opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument. Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario, weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate this taxonomy. We further introduce a practical procedure to estimate these spectral properties from data, allowing practitioners to diagnose which regime a given problem falls into. We apply this method to the dSprites dataset, demonstrating its utility.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies fine-grained singular subspace estimation in the matrix denoising model where a deterministic low-rank signal matrix is additively perturbed by a stochastic matrix of Gaussian noise. We establish that the maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the two-to-infinity norm empirically has higher power to detect structured alternatives that differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving row-wise matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve this, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. We evaluate the performance of these multivariate models using lung cancer incidence data and the corresponding number of deaths reported in England for the period 2001-2019. Model performance was assessed using different predictive measures to select the best model.",

To address this critical gap, we introduce PEHRT, a common pipeline for harmonizing EHR data for translational research. PEHRT is a comprehensive, ready-to-use resource that includes open-source code, visualization tools, and detailed documentation to streamline the process of preparing EHR data for analysis. The pipeline provides tools to harmonize structured and unstructured EHR data to standardized ontologies to ensure consistency across diverse coding systems. In the presence of unmapped or heterogeneous local codes, PEHRT further leverages representation learning and pre-trained language models to generate robust embeddings that capture semantic relationships across sites to mitigate heterogeneity and enable integrative downstream analyses. PEHRT also supports cross-institutional co-training through shared representations, allowing participating sites to collaboratively refine embeddings and enhance generalizability without sharing individual-level data. The framework is data model-agnostic and can be seamlessly deployed across diverse healthcare systems to produce interoperable, research-ready datasets. By lowering the technical barriers to EHR-based research, PEHRT empowers investigators to transform raw clinical data into reproducible, analysis-ready resources for discovery and innovation.",

In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.",

Here, we extend supervised learning to address learning to \\textit{control} in non-stationary, reset-free environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Learning with Control'' (PL+C), we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective learning with control, foraging -- which is a canonical task for any mobile agent -- be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that modern RL algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary reset-free environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.",

Within this framework, we justify and extend the open-faced sandwich adjustment (Shaby, 2014), provide general theoretical guarantees for its use within generalized Bayes, and extend it from covariance rescaling to a location--scale calibration whose draws converge in total variation to the target for any learning rate. In our empirical illustration, calibrated draws maintain stable coverage, interval width, and bias over orders of magnitude in the learning rate and closely track frequentist benchmarks, whereas uncalibrated posteriors vary markedly.",

    "abstract": "While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \\textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.

To address large-scale SBO, decentralized approaches have emerged as effective paradigms in which nodes communicate with immediate neighbors without a central server, thereby improving communication efficiency and enhancing algorithmic robustness. However, most decentralized SBO algorithms focus solely on asymptotic convergence rates, overlooking transient iteration complexity-the number of iterations required before asymptotic rates dominate, which results in limited understanding of the influence of network topology, data heterogeneity, and the nested bilevel algorithmic structures. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-SOBA, a Decentralized Stochastic One-loop Bilevel Algorithm framework. D-SOBA comprises two variants: D-SOBA-SO, which incorporates second-order Hessian and Jacobian matrices, and D-SOBA-FO, which relies entirely on first-order gradients. We provide a comprehensive non-asymptotic convergence analysis and establish the transient iteration complexity of D-SOBA. This provides the first theoretical understanding of how network topology, data heterogeneity, and nested bilevel structures influence decentralized SBO. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and theoretical advantages of D-SOBA.",

Among diverse data valuation approaches, Shapley value-based methods are predominant due to their strong theoretical grounding. However, the exact computation of Shapley values is often computationally prohibitive, prompting the development of numerous approximation techniques. Despite notable advancements, existing methods generally neglect the incorporation of value distribution information and fail to account for dynamic data conditions, thereby compromising their performance and application potential. In this paper, we highlight the crucial role of both global and local statistical properties of value distributions in the context of data valuation for machine learning. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these distributions across various simulated and real-world datasets, uncovering valuable insights and key patterns. Second, we propose an enhanced data valuation method that fuses the explored distribution characteristics into two regularization terms to refine Shapley value estimation. The proposed regularizers can be seamlessly incorporated into various existing data valuation methods. Third, we introduce a novel approach for dynamic data valuation that infers updated data values without recomputing Shapley values, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive experiments have been conducted across a range of tasks, including Shapley value estimation, value-based data addition and removal, mislabeled data detection, and dynamic data valuation. The results showcase the consistent effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies, affirming the significant potential of global and local value distributions in data valuation.",

To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-Table Synthesizer (CTSyn), a diffusion-based generative foundation model for tabular data generation. CTSyn comprises two key components. The first is an autoencoder network that consolidates diverse tables into a unified latent space. It dynamically reconstructs table values using a table schema embedding, allowing adaptation to heterogeneous datasets. The second is a conditional latent diffusion model that generates samples from the learned latent space, conditioned on the table schema. Through large-scale pre-training, CTSyn outperforms existing table synthesizers on standard benchmarks in both utility and diversity. These results position CTSyn as a promising framework for synthetic table generation and lay the groundwork for developing large-scale tabular foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Surrogate regret bounds, also known as excess risk bounds, bridge the gap between the convergence rates of surrogate and target losses. The regret transfer is lossless if the surrogate regret bound is linear. While convex smooth surrogate losses are appealing in particular due to the efficient estimation and optimization, the existence of a trade-off between the loss smoothness and linear regret bound has been believed in the community. Under this scenario, the better optimization and estimation properties of convex smooth surrogate losses may inevitably deteriorate after undergoing the regret transfer onto a target loss. We overcome this dilemma for arbitrary discrete target losses by constructing a convex smooth surrogate loss, which entails a linear surrogate regret bound composed with a tailored prediction link. The construction is based on Fenchel--Young losses generated by the convolutional negentropy, which are equivalent to the infimal convolution of a generalized negentropy and the target Bayes risk. Consequently, the infimal convolution enables us to derive a smooth loss while maintaining the surrogate regret bound linear. We additionally benefit from the infimal convolution to have a consistent estimator of the underlying class probability. Our results are overall a novel demonstration of how convex analysis penetrates into optimization and statistical efficiency in risk minimization.",

Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.",

    "title": "Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks",
    "abstract": "Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.",

    "abstract": "Using monthly Patreon earnings, we quantify how platform attention algorithms shape earnings concentration across creator economies. Patreon is a tool for creators to monetize additional content from loyal subscribers but offers little native distribution, so its earnings proxy well for the attention creators capture on external platforms (Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and ``Patreon-only''). Fitting power-law tails to test for a highly unequal earnings distribution, we have three key findings. First, across years and platforms the earnings tail and distribution exhibits a Pareto exponent around $\\alpha \\approx 2$, closer to concentrated capital income than to labor income and consistent with a compounding, ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Second, when algorithms tilt more attention toward the top, the gains are drawn disproportionately from the creator ``middle class''. Third, over time, creator inequality across social media platforms converge toward similarly heavy-tailed (and increasingly concentrated) distributions, plausibly as algorithmic recommendations rises in importance relative to user-filtered content via the social graph. While our Patreon-sourced data represents a small subset of total creator earnings on these platforms, it provides unique insight into the cross-platform algorithmic effects on earnings concentration.",

Recent works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in compute- and memory-constrained scenarios. We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss, motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator. Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.",

Recent works have demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts, often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to automatically identify trustworthy supervision.",

    "abstract": "As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications, but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than existing alternatives, often enough to reveal statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.",

Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.",

In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\\Omega(\\kappa^{3/2}\\epsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $\\Omega(\\kappa^{5/2}\\epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.",

Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.",

However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics. Our analytical findings are corroborated using realistic flows from a traffic simulator and offer valuable insights to grid operators and ER designers.",

The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&O-based MPPT algorithms. These results underscore its suitability for integration in low-power power management integrated circuits (PMICs) operating under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety in autonomous multi-agent systems during time-critical tasks such as rendezvous is a fundamental challenge, particularly under communication delays and uncertainty in system parameters. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the \\emph{distributionally robust risk of cascading failures} in multi-agent rendezvous, where system parameters lie within bounded uncertainty sets around nominal values. Using a time-delayed dynamical network as a benchmark model, we quantify how small deviations in these parameters impact collective safety. We introduce a \\emph{conditional distributionally robust functional}, grounded in a bivariate Gaussian model, to characterize risk propagation between agents. This yields a \\emph{closed-form risk expression} that captures the complex interaction between time delays, network structure, noise statistics, and failure modes. These expressions expose key sensitivity patterns and provide actionable insight for the design of robust and resilient multi-agent networks. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

    "abstract": "Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.",

To this end, the EDMD algorithm processed only voltage and current phasors from nineteen PMUs at different voltage levels across the Danish grid. In such a blind-test setting with no supplementary system information, EDMD accurately pinpointed the location of the main contributor to the 0.2 Hz oscillation, consistent with the location of the problematic IBR plant later confirmed by Energinet, where the underlying cause was a control system issue. Conventional approaches, such as the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method used in the ISO-NE OSL tool did not clearly identify this plant. This joint validation with Energinet, reinforcing earlier studies using simulated IBR-dominated systems and real PMU data from ISO-NE, highlights the potential of EDMD-based post-event analysis for identifying major oscillation contributors and enabling targeted SSO mitigation.",

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices. In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.",

This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.",

This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.",

    "abstract": "We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful.

Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems",

This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability.

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.",

    "abstract": "To improve speech intelligibility in complex everyday situations, the human auditory system partially relies on Interaural Time Differences (ITDs) and Interaural Level Differences (ILDs). However, hearing impaired (HI) listeners often exhibit limited sensitivity to ITDs, resulting in decreased speech intelligibility performance. This study aimed to investigate whether transforming low-frequency ITDs into ILDs could reintroduce a binaural benefit for HI listeners. We conducted two experiments with HI listeners. The first experiment used binaurally phase-shifted sinusoids at different frequencies to evaluate the HI listeners ITD sensitivity threshold. All subjects had an increased ITD threshold at higher frequencies, with different ITD sensitivities between the subjects in the lower frequencies. In the second experiment, Speech Reception Thresholds (SRTs) were measured in different binaural configurations by manipulating Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). The results showed that, despite the decreased ITD sensitivity, removing ITDs decreased SRTs by approximately 1 dB compared to the unprocessed baseline, where ITDs and ILDs are available. Furthermore, substituting low-frequency ITDs with ILDs yielded an improvement for a lateral target speaker. Adding the low-frequency ILDs while preserving the ITDs caused a significant improvement for speakers in all directions. These findings suggest that the proposed transformation method could be effective in restoring binaural benefits in HI listeners. The results of this study suggest the use of such transformation techniques to be implemented in hearing aids and cochlear implants, directly benefiting HI listeners.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a theoretical framework to describe the transition from consensus to stable clustering in multi-agent systems with nonlinear, cooperative interactions. We first establish a sharp threshold for consensus. For a broad class of non-decreasing, Lipschitz-continuous interactions, an explicit inequality linking the interaction's Lipschitz constant to the second-largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix of the interaction graph confines all system equilibria to the synchronization manifold. This condition is shown to be a sharp threshold, as its violation permits the emergence of non-synchronized equilibria. We also demonstrate that such clustered states can only arise if the interaction law itself possesses specific structural properties, such as unstable fixed points. For the clustered states that emerge, we introduce a formal framework using Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory to quantify their robustness. This approach allows us to prove that the internal cohesion of a cluster is robust to perturbations from the rest of the network. The analysis reveals a fundamental principle: cluster coherence is limited not by the magnitude of external influence, but by its heterogeneity across internal nodes. This unified framework, explaining both the sharp breakdown of consensus and the quantifiable robustness of the resulting modular structures, is validated on Zachary's Karate Club network, used as a classic benchmark for community structure.",

    "title": "Response-Based Frequency Stability Assessment under Multi-Scale Disturbances in High-Renewable Power Systems",
    "abstract": "In high-renewable power systems, active-power disturbances are becoming larger and exhibit increasingly diverse time scales, which complicates frequency stability assessment under unanticipated events. This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems.",

    "abstract": "Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.",

In this context, the present paper introduces an advanced machine-learning solution that enhances a deterministic fault distance estimator by incorporating a correction model driven by a Gated Residual Network, specifically designed to minimize residual fault location errors. Through comprehensive feature engineering and selection processes, an improved predictor was developed and trained on a diverse set of fault scenarios simulated in a PSCAD-based real-world wind farm model, including variations in fault type, resistance, location, inception angle, and generation penetration. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using the Optuna framework, and the robustness of the method was statistically validated. Results show a significant improvement in accuracy, with a 76% overall decrease in fault location error compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method demonstrates strong scalability and adaptability to topological and operational changes.

While these advancements provide improved interoperability, challenges such as high costs, complex networks, and limited upgradeability persist. To mitigate these issues, the virtualization of IEDs has emerged as a cost-effective solution, offering scalability, simplified maintenance, and reduced hardware costs by replacing traditional hardware-based IEDs with software-based counterparts. However, the performance and reliability of virtual IEDs (vIED) must be rigorously evaluated to ensure their robustness in real-time applications. This paper develops, implements, and evaluates a vIED designed to match the performance of its hardware-based counterparts. The vIED was deployed on a server using virtual machines, with its core logic implemented in low-level programming languages to ensure high-speed, deterministic behavior. The performance was evaluated using real-time simulations, focusing on the response times of the protection functions. The results demonstrated that vIEDs achieved acceptable response times, validating their suitability for deployment in critical time-sensitive environments within digital substations.",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.",

We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.",

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size.

Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures.

By analyzing confirmed disturbances from 2013 to 2024, we identify trends in regional inertia and frequency dynamics, highlighting their relationship with renewable generation and the evolving duck curve. Regional RoCoF values were up to six times higher than interconnection-wide values, coinciding with declining inertia. Recent recovery in inertia is attributed to the increased deployment of battery energy storage systems with synthetic inertia capabilities. These findings underscore the importance of regional inertia monitoring, strategic resource planning, and adaptive operational practices to ensure grid reliability amid growing renewable integration.",

However, unlike discrete signal representations such as voxel grids, neural fields cannot be easily extended. As neural fields are, in essence, neural networks, prior signals represented in a neural field will degrade when the model is presented with new data due to catastrophic forgetting. This work examines the extent to which different neural field approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and proposes a strategy to mitigate this issue. We consider the scenario in which data becomes available incrementally, with only the most recent data available for neural field fitting. In a series of experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we demonstrate how knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or the dimensionality of the represented signal is increased. We find that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends, to a large extent, on the neural fields model used, and that distillation could enable continual learning in neural fields.",

The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space.

The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful measurements and to recover consistent estimates once the correct hypothesis is identified. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the approach to contain the effect of adversarial measurements, while also highlighting the impact of conservative fusion on detection speed. The framework provides a foundation for resilient multi-agent navigation and can be extended with coordinated hypothesis selection across the network.",

    "abstract": "This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages. The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure. Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.",

    "abstract": "Accurately registering in-vivo two-photon and ex-vivo fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography images of individual neurons is critical for structure-function analysis in neuroscience. This task is profoundly challenging due to a significant cross-modality appearance gap, the scarcity of annotated data and severe tissue deformations. We propose a novel deep learning framework to address these issues. Our method introduces a semantic-enhanced hybrid feature descriptor, which fuses the geometric precision of local features with the contextual robustness of a vision foundation model DINOV3 to bridge the modality gap. To handle complex deformations, we replace traditional RANSAC with a learnable Geometric Consistency Confidence Module, a novel classifier trained to identify and reject physically implausible correspondences. A data-efficient two-stage training strategy, involving pre-training on synthetically deformed data and fine-tuning on limited real data, overcomes the data scarcity problem. Our framework provides a robust and accurate solution for high-precision registration in challenging biomedical imaging scenarios, enabling large-scale correlative studies.",

By capturing radar reflections as a three-dimensional tensor encoding phase dynamics, range bin power, and angle-of-arrival (AoA), we apply PARAFAC decomposition with non-negative constraints to extract compact, interpretable pollutant fingerprints. These are used to train a lightweight student neural network via knowledge distillation, enabling joint classification and quantification of heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mg), oil emulsions, and sediments.

    "abstract": "Recent video codecs such as VVC and AV1 apply a Non-rectangular (NR) partitioning to combine prediction signals using a smooth blending around the boundary, followed by a rectangular transform on the whole block. The NR signal transformation is not yet supported. A transformation technique that applies the same partitioning to the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases and finds a sparse representation of the NR signal in such a dictionary showed promising gains in an experimental setup outside the reference software. This method uses the regular inverse transformation at the decoder to reconstruct a rectangular signal and discards the signal outside the region of interest. This design is appealing due to the minimal changes required at the decoder. However, current entropy coding schemes are not well-suited for optimally encoding these coefficients because they are primarily designed for DCT coefficients. This work introduces an entropy coding method that efficiently codes these transform coefficients by effectively modeling their properties. The design offers significant theoretical rate savings, estimated using conditional entropy, particularly for scenarios that are more dissimilar to DCT in an experimental setup.",

Contrary to existing approaches, that assume perfect information or use heuristic maneuver models in stochastic settings, we formulate the problem in an inherently stochastic framework involving imperfect information and bounded controls. Complying with the generalized separation theorem, the control law factors in the posterior distribution of the state. Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer. Monte Carlo simulations show that the TSE strategy outperforms traditional stochastic evasion strategies based on random telegraph, Singer, and weaving models.",

The developed method derives from the ultimate sensitivity principles, known in the empirical Ziegler-Nichols tuning of PID control, and makes use of some general characteristics of loop shaping. A three-steps procedure is proposed to determine the integration time constant, control gain, and Lead-element in a way to guarantee a sufficient phase margin, while all steps are served by only experimental observations of the output value.

Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified.

    "abstract": "Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair. A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies. By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance",

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.",

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.",

Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.",

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene.

One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population. In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.",

A key advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require the state derivative and uses continuous-time data directly without sampling or filtering. First, systems compatible with given data are described by the synthesis operators into which data trajectories are embedded. Next, we characterize data informativity properties for system identification and for stabilization. Finally, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for informativity for quadratic stabilization in the presence of process noise. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities by exploiting the finite-rank structure of the synthesis operators.",

    "abstract": "Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.",

    "abstract": "Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.",

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.",

Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided.

The weighted-median mechanism has recently been proposed as a well-founded alternative to conventional DeGroot-type opinion dynamics. However, the original weighted-median model excludes compromise behavior, as individuals directly adopt their neighbors' opinions without forming intermediate values. In this paper, we introduce a parsimonious continuous-time extension of the weighted-median model by incorporating individual inertia, allowing opinions to move gradually toward the neighbors' weighted median. Empirical evidence shows that this model outperforms both the original weighted-median and DeGroot models with inertia in predicting opinion shifts. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the proposed dynamics: the equilibria are characterized and shown to be Lyapunov stable; global convergence is established via the Bony-Brezis method, yielding necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus from arbitrary initial states. In addition, we derive a graph-theoretic condition for persistent disagreement and a necessary and sufficient condition for steering the system to any prescribed consensus value through constant external inputs to a subset of individuals. These results reveal how a social group's resilience to external manipulation fundamentally depends on its internal network structure.",

To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.",

Neural network controllers have gained popularity due to their adaptability to nonlinearities and disturbances; however, they often lack formal closed-loop stability and performance guarantees. To address these challenges, a recently proposed neural-network control framework known as Performance Boosting (PB) has demonstrated the ability to maintain $\\mathcal{L}_p$ stability properties of nonlinear systems while optimizing generic transient costs. This paper extends the PB approach to reference tracking problems. First, we characterize the complete set of nonlinear controllers that preserve desired tracking properties for nonlinear systems equipped with base reference-tracking controllers. Then, we show how to optimize transient costs while searching within subsets of tracking controllers that incorporate expressive neural network models.

In this work, we propose LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the LUNA16 dataset. The proposed LMLCC-Net was evaluated using the LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.96%, a sensitivity of 92.94%, and an area under the curve of 94.07%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods The proposed method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the classification of pulmonary nodules and improving patient care.",

Cohort I (56 contrast-enhanced CT [CECT], 124 non-contrast CT [NCCT] scans from lung cancer patients, supine position) was used to train an oracle model (180 cases), contrast-only model (56 CECTs), and balanced model (32 CECT, 32 NCCT). All models were evaluated on 60 held-out cohort I patients and 66 cohort II breast cancer patients (45 supine, 21 prone). Accuracy was measured using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and dosimetric metrics, with TotalSegmentator as benchmark.

    "abstract": "Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching (WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1) the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are geographically isolated.",

    "abstract": "The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze multi-agent network systems, such as heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservativeness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometric decentralized stability condition based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell and its projections. Our approach provides a geometric interpretation of the small-gain and small-phase theorems and enables decentralized stability analysis of power systems. It serves as a visualization method to understand the closed-loop interactions and assess the stability of large-scale network systems in a scalable and modular manner.",

    "abstract": "Graph Signal Processing (GSP) extends classical signal processing to signals defined on graphs, enabling filtering, spectral analysis, and sampling of data generated by networks of various kinds. Graphon Signal Processing (GnSP) develops this framework further by employing the theory of graphons. Graphons are measurable functions on the unit square that represent graphs and limits of convergent graph sequences. The use of graphons provides stability of GSP methods to stochastic variability in network data and improves computational efficiency for very large networks. We use GnSP to address the stimulus identification problem (SIP) in computational and biological neural networks. The SIP is an inverse problem that aims to infer the unknown stimulus s from the observed network output f. We first validate the approach in spiking neural network simulations and then analyze calcium imaging recordings. Graphon-based spectral projections yield trial-invariant, lowdimensional embeddings that improve stimulus classification over Principal Component Analysis and discrete GSP baselines. The embeddings remain stable under variations in network stochasticity, providing robustness to different network sizes and noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GnSP to biological neural networks, opening new avenues for graphon-based analysis in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Environmental licensing related to underwater acoustic emissions represents a critical bottleneck for the commercial deployment of marine renewable energy. This study presents a control engineering framework to mitigate acoustic risks from tidal current converters without compromising project viability. A MATLAB/Simulink model of a tidal current converter was utilised to evaluate two distinct mitigation tiers: (1) architectural modification, comparing a geared induction generator against a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator, and (2) operational control, analysing the impact of switching frequencies and maximum power point tracking coefficient tuning. Results indicate that lowering switching frequencies is ineffective, increasing power electronic losses by over 2000% with negligible acoustic benefit. Conversely, the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator architecture reduced sound pressure levels, effectively eliminating mechanical tonal noise. For existing geared systems, de-tuning the maximum power point tracking coefficient by a factor of 1.2 reduced the probability of exceeding temporary threshold shift limits for marine mammals, with a quantified energy yield reduction of 3.58%. These findings propose a hierarchical mitigation strategy: selecting direct-drive topologies for acoustically sensitive sites, and utilising maximum power point tracking coefficient based power curtailment as a transient operational mode during critical biological migration periods.",

In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.",

However, qMT requires specialized 20-30 minute scans.

Our approach has two stages: first, we train separate autoencoders for PSR and anatomical images to learn aligned latent representations. Second, we train a conditional diffusion model in this latent space on top of a frozen diffusion foundation backbone. Conditioning is decoupled into: (i) \\textbf{semantic} tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \\textbf{spatial} per-scale residual hints via a 3D ControlNet branch, and (iii) \\textbf{adaptive} LoRA-modulated attention. We include edge-aware loss terms to preserve lesion boundaries and alignment losses to maintain quantitative consistency, while keeping the number of trainable parameters low and retaining the inductive bias of the pretrained model. We evaluate on 163 scans from 99 subjects using 5-fold cross-validation.

Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.",

    "abstract": "Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their cumulative benefit and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. A post-learning search step based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is added that is able to find even better solutions. Experiments show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.",

Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets.

In this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec -- that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 39% bitrate reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based codecs.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM) policy for the constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities. Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF and Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets.",

    "abstract": "Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

    "abstract": "Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.",

Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator.

    "title": "HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization",
    "abstract": "Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.",

    "abstract": "In auction markets that are prone to market power abuse, preventive mitigation of bid prices can be applied through automated mitigation procedures (AMP). Despite the widespread application of AMP in US electricity markets, there exists scarce evidence on how firms strategically react to such price-cap-and-penalty regulation: when the price cap rarely leads to penalty mitigation, it is difficult to distinguish whether AMP are an effective deterrent or simply too lax. We investigate their impact on the bids of generation firms, using 2019 data from the New York and New England electricity markets (NYISO, ISO-NE). We employ a regression discontinuity design, which exploits the fact that the price cap with penalty is only activated when a structural index (e.g., congestion, pivotality) exceeds a certain cutoff. By estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of screening activation, we can causally identify successful deterrence of anti-competitive behavior. Around 30-40% of the analyzed bidders per market exhibit a significant strategic response - corresponding to a decrease in maximum bid prices of 4-10 $/MWh to avoid the penalty. However, there is significant heterogeneity between firms, and the regulatory impact on the overall market is not statistically detectable, suggesting lax mitigation thresholds. Using a merit-order simulation, we estimate the welfare impact of more stringent thresholds to lie between 350 and 980 thousand dollars of increased buyer surplus per mitigated hour, with the associated number of mitigated hours being below 33 hours/year. Our results motivate the empirical calibration of mitigation thresholds to improve the efficiency of AMP regulation.",

Often, other agents on the contestant's team (e.g., a coach of an athlete) or a company (a manager of an R\\&D engineer) have a vested interest in outcomes and can influence the cheating decision. An agency problem arises when only the contestant faces the penalties for cheating. Our theoretical framework examines joint liability, i.e., shifting some responsibility from the contestant to the other agent, as a solution to this agency problem. Equilibrium analysis shows that extending liability reduces cheating if fines are harsh. Less intuitively, when fines are lenient, a shift in liability can lead to an increase in equilibrium cheating rates. Experimental tests confirm that joint liability is effective in reducing cheating if fines are high. However, the predicted detrimental effect of joint liability for low fines does not occur.",

Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.",

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses how the growing availability of working from home (WFH) shapes office employees' preferences to move to the suburbs and pinpoints the socio-economic factors that drive those intentions. We focus on Poland, where the housing market is shaped by exceptionally high home-ownership rates and specific suburbanisation patterns. We surveyed city-dwelling office employees (living in municipalities of 100,000 or more) to gauge their willingness to relocate. Logistic-regression estimates then linked those intentions to respondents' demographics, job attributes, commuting patterns, and self-reported productivity shifts under WFH. The study tests three mechanisms. Commuting cost is proxied by travel mode and one-way time; life-course triggers by age, children, and tenure; and job-demands/resources by self-rated productivity under WFH. Sector and city size serve as contextual controls. Linking variables to theory in this way clarifies how the forthcoming results adjudicate among competing explanations. The results indicate that age, commuting mode, self-assessed productivity changes, and employment sector (private versus public) markedly influence the likelihood of considering a move to the suburbs in response to remote-work options. Contrary to expectations, household size, measured by number of children, does not play a significant role. Overall, the evidence suggests that remote work, especially in hybrid form, could become an additional catalyst for suburban expansion in markets characterised by scarce affordable rentals and a strong preference for home ownership, such as Poland.",

    "abstract": "A researcher allocates a budget of informative tests across multiple unknown attributes to influence a decision-maker. We derive the researcher's equilibrium learning strategy by solving an auxiliary single-player problem. The attribute weights in this problem depend on how much the researcher and the decision-maker disagree. If the researcher expects an excessive response to new information, she forgoes learning altogether. In an organizational context, we show that a manager favors more diverse analysts as the hierarchical distance grows. In another application, we show how an appropriately opposed advisor can constrain a discriminatory politician, and identify the welfare-inequality Pareto frontier of researchers.",

By listing a bundle, a student seeks admission to any school within it without ranking the schools. This approach helps students who struggle to rank schools precisely and expands options on limited preference lists, potentially improving match outcomes. We design a modified deferred acceptance mechanism to handle bundle reports while preserving stability. Two laboratory experiments support our theory, showing that well-constructed bundles aligned with student preferences enhance welfare and match rates without compromising fairness. Practical applications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Double Machine Learning is widely used to estimate causal treatment effects in large-scale observational data. The ``residuals-on-residuals'' regression estimator (RORR) is especially popular for its simplicity and computational tractability. However, when treatment effects are heterogeneous, the proper interpretation of RORR may not be widely understood. We show that for many-valued treatments with continuous dose-response functions, RORR converges to a conditional variance-weighted average of derivatives evaluated at points not in the observed dataset. This estimand does not in general equal the Average Causal Derivative (ACD). Hence, even if all units share the same dose-response function, RORR may not converge to an average treatment effect in the population represented by the sample. We propose an alternative estimator for the ACD that is suitable for large datasets. We demonstrate the pitfalls of RORR and the favorable properties of the proposed estimator through an illustrative numerical example and with real-world data from Netflix. Our methodology is deployed in Netflix's internal observational causal inference platform, where it regularly powers causal research and decision-making at scale.",

If agents have common valuations for one of the goods, damages always lead to Pareto-dominated mechanisms: any allocation using damages can also be implemented with ordeals alone, while also leaving greater rents to inframarginal types. However, using damages can be optimal when agents' valuations for both goods are heterogeneous: with multidimensional types, the two devices differ in how they sort agents into available options, with the optimal sorting sometimes requiring the use of damages. I nevertheless identify distributional conditions under which using damages is not optimal. In those cases, the optimal mechanism produces an efficient allocation by posting \"market-clearing\" ordeals for each type of good.",

However, to date no identification-robust inference methods exist that can be used in conjunction with the ML estimators for these models. In this paper we propose ML based inference methods for panel AR(1) models with arbitrary initial conditions and heteroskedasticity that are robust to the strength of identification. We show that (Quasi) Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests and confidence sets (CSs) that use the expected Hessian rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood function have correct asymptotic size and coverage probability in a uniform sense, respectively. Such Quasi LM tests and CSs are also robust to misspecification of the distribution of the data and to heterogeneity, including heteroskedasticity. We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects version of such an LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with the maximal attainable power curve in the worst-case setting. We also study the empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and find that the hypothesis that the (Quasi) LM test has correct size cannot be rejected.",

    "abstract": "Standard models of asset price dynamics, such as geometric Brownian motion (see, for example, Osborne, 1959, Samuelson, 2016), do not formally incorporate investor inertia. This paper presents a two-stage framework for modelling this behaviour. First, we establish a microfoundation for the classic diffusion-with-advection model by representing the asset's log price as a three-state random walk (up, down or neutral). While this derivation offers a clear behavioural origin for drift and volatility, it is ultimately limited by its Gaussian nature and fails to capture the heavy tails (leptokurtosis) observed in financial markets. To address this issue, we introduce and apply a fourth-order extension inspired by diffusion-with-retention models (Bevilacqua, 2011), where a more complex representation of inertia generates non-Gaussian dynamics. Through an empirical application using Brazilian this http URL data, we demonstrate that this extended model significantly outperforms the original in fitting the real distribution of returns. Our findings suggest that investor inertia is a dual concept capable of explaining both standard market trends and extreme events.",

Patreon is a tool for creators to monetize additional content from loyal subscribers but offers little native distribution, so its earnings proxy well for the attention creators capture on external platforms (Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and ``Patreon-only''). Fitting power-law tails to test for a highly unequal earnings distribution, we have three key findings. First, across years and platforms the earnings tail and distribution exhibits a Pareto exponent around $\\alpha \\approx 2$, closer to concentrated capital income than to labor income and consistent with a compounding, ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Second, when algorithms tilt more attention toward the top, the gains are drawn disproportionately from the creator ``middle class''. Third, over time, creator inequality across social media platforms converge toward similarly heavy-tailed (and increasingly concentrated) distributions, plausibly as algorithmic recommendations rises in importance relative to user-filtered content via the social graph. While our Patreon-sourced data represents a small subset of total creator earnings on these platforms, it provides unique insight into the cross-platform algorithmic effects on earnings concentration.",

    "abstract": "As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications, but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than existing alternatives, often enough to reveal statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.",

To facilitate this analysis, we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting an overlooked policy transmission. This framework enables conditional forecasting, equipping policymakers with a flexible tool to assess macro-financial linkages under different economic scenarios.",

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal dynamic mechanism collapses to a simple terminal design: a single public experiment at date 0 followed by a posterior-dependent static mechanism executed at a deterministic date, with no further disclosure. The key condition is the existence of a global affine shadow value that supports the posterior-based revenue frontier and uniformly bounds all history-dependent revenues. When this condition fails, a collapse statistic pinpoints the dates and public state variables that generate genuine dynamic value.

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a new class of experimental designs. In a classical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected subset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or experiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the population is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple comparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in classical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which multiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study questions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized experiments. Finally, we develop new statistical methods for analyzing these Multiple Randomization Designs.",

Agents stay in the market according to a certain sojourn time and wait to be matched with a compatible agent by a matching algorithm. When their maximum sojourn time is reached, they perish unmatched. The primary objective is to maximize the number of matched agents. Our main result is to show that a uniformly guaranteed sojourn time suffices to get almost optimal performance of instantaneous matching. Interestingly, this matching policy essentially keeps as few agents in the market as possible. Hence, in contrast to the common paradigm that market thickness is the crucial property for obtaining strong matching performance, we show that the agents' sojourn behavior can be an equally powerful factor. In addition, instantaneous matching is close to optimal with respect to minimizing waiting time.

We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training.

Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent.
