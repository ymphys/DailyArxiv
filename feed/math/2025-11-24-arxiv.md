## 1. Pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian norm Estimates for Robertson class

**作者**: Molla Basir Ahamed, Rajesh Hossain, Xiaoyuan Wang

**摘要**: Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the class of analytic functions $f$ on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C} : |z|<1\}$, normalized by $f(0)=0$ and $f^{\prime}(0)=1$. For $-\pi/2<\alpha<\pi/2$, let $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ be the subclass of $\mathcal{A}$ consisting of functions $f$ that satisfy the relation $\mathrm{Re}\{e^{i\alpha}\left(1+zf^{\prime\prime}(z)/f^{\prime}(z)\right)\}>0$ for $z\in\mathbb{D}$. In this paper, we first give an equivalent characterization for a subclass of Robertson functions; then we present the distortion and growth theorems and obtain the pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian norms for the subclass $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$. In addition, a sharp upper bound of the Schwarzian norm for the subclass is given in terms of the value $f^{\prime \prime}(0)$.

## 2. Optimal management of the vaccination process in SIRD epidemic models under constraints

**作者**: Bogdan Norkin, Vladimir Norkin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16763.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16763.pdf)

**摘要**: The paper considers the problems of optimal vaccination control in the classical SIR model under constraints on the resource capabilities of the insurance medical system, in particular under constraints on the possible absolute rate of vaccination of the population and the limitation on the available number of vaccines. The application of classical optimal control methods, the dynamic programming method and the Pontryagin maximum principle for such a model encounters difficulties associated with the possible non-smoothness of the Bellman function, and in the Pontryagin method the problem is to solve a boundary value problem with discontinuous control. Therefore, in the paper, optimal control is sought in the class of the so-called parametric strategies, which reduces the original problem to a finite-dimensional optimization problem with respect to unknown parameters.

## 3. Irreducible train tracks for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms

**作者**: Ross Griebenow

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16782.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16782.pdf)

**摘要**: We describe a construction of invariant train tracks with irreducible transition matrix for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. This fills what seems to be a gap in the literature concerning the existence of such train tracks. The construction starts with an invariant train track associated to the veering triangulation of the mapping torus of the homeomorphism and then uses the veering property to characterize branches which obstruct irreducibility, finally modifying the track to bypass these obstructions.

## 4. Fractional Derivatives: an extension of classical analysis to non-integer orders

**作者**: Félix del Teso, David Gómez-Castro

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16789.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16789.pdf)

**摘要**: This article provides an accessible introduction to fractional derivatives, a concept that extends classical calculus by allowing derivatives of non-integer order. It explores both the fundamental definitions and some of the most relevant properties and applications of this mathematical tool. It was originally published in Spanish in the Gaceta de la Real Sociedad Española and automatically translated using Github copilot.

## 5. A permutation-based power series representation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula

**作者**: Joseph M. Jones, M. W. Long

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16790.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16790.pdf)

**摘要**: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula was recently resummed exactly in one variable, and left as a power series in the other (Moodie and Long 2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 015208). The coefficients of the power series were provided as a sum of products of three hyperbolic functions that are analogous to the familiar commutator expansion. We find a new form of the power series coefficients that is a linear combination of just one of the hyperbolic functions. This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion. It also allows us to prove a set of intriguing marching identities that are useful in physical applications and were discovered in the initial work.

## 6. Efficient Penalty-Based Bilevel Methods: Improved Analysis, Novel Updates, and Flatness Condition

**作者**: Liuyuan Jiang, Quan Xiao, Lisha Chen, Tianyi Chen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16796.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16796.pdf)

**摘要**: Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the "flatness" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.

## 7. The Boundary Dehn Twist on a Punctured Connected Sum of Two K3 Surfaces is Nontrivial in the Smooth Mapping Class Group

**作者**: Scotty Tilton

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16804.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16804.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove that the boundary Dehn twist on $K3\#K3\setminus B^4$ is nontrivial in the smooth mapping class group, providing another example of an exotic diffeomorphism on a simply-connected spin four-manifold. We do so by finding an algebraic criterion that must be satisfied if the two maps are smoothly isotopic. The main tools involved are the $\Pintwo$-equivariant families Bauer-Furuta invariant, equivariant topological $K$-theory, and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence to show this algebraic criterion cannot be satisfied, and this establishes the result. As a corollary, we find any smooth bundle $K3\#K3\into E\downarrow S^2$ has $w_2(T^vE)=0$, so $E$ is spin.

## 8. Vanka-smoothed shifted Laplacian multigrid preconditioners for the Helmholtz equations

**作者**: Rachel Yovel, Yunhui He, Eran Treister

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16808.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16808.pdf)

**摘要**: We present an improved multigrid preconditioner for the acoustic Helmholtz equation with enhanced scalability. Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D.

## 9. Groups acting on horocyclic products

**作者**: Noah Caplinger, Daniel N. Levitin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16809.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16809.pdf)

**摘要**: Horocyclic products are a well-studied class of metric spaces that provide models for various solvable Lie groups, Baumslag-Solitar groups, and Lamplighter groups. Let $G$ act geometrically on a horocyclic product $X \bowtie Y$ of $\CAT(-\kappa)$ spaces $X,Y$. We show that every such group is either an ascending HNN extension of a finitely-generated virtually nilpotent group, or else is not finitely presented, depending on the connectivity of the visual boundary of $X\bowtie Y$.

## 10. Exceptions to the Erd\H os--Straus--Schinzel conjecture

**作者**: Carl Pomerance, Andreas Weingartner

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16817.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16817.pdf)

**摘要**: A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpiński, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge19$. In addition we generalize a result of Vaughan to show that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable, and we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.

## 11. Scatter-Limited Hybrid Monte Carlo, Deterministic Transport with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling

**作者**: Johannes Krotz, Ryan G. McClarren

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16821.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16821.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a hybrid method for time-dependent particle transport that combines Monte Carlo (MC) estimation with a deterministic discrete ordinates (\(S_N\)) solve, augmented by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \(S_N\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.
A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \(N_{s}\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \(S_N\) solve; \(N_s=0\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \(N_s>0\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.
We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver.

## 12. The F. John model and Cummins' equations for freely floating objects

**作者**: David Lannes, Martin Oen Paulsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16826.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16826.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $\pi/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally.

## 13. Minimal Generation of Mapping Class Groups: A Survey of the Nonorientable Case

**作者**: Tulin Altunoz, Mehmetcik Pamuk, Oguz Yildiz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16829.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16829.pdf)

**摘要**: This chapter provides a comprehensive survey of foundational results and recent advances concerning minimal generating sets for the mapping class group of a nonorientable surface, $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g})$, and its index-two twist subgroup, $\mathcal{T}_{g}$. Although the theory for orientable surfaces is well established, the nonorientable case presents unique challenges due to the presence of crosscaps, thus requiring generators beyond Dehn twists. We show that, for a sufficiently large genus $g$, both $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g})$ and $\mathcal{T}_{g}$ are generated by two elements, which is the minimum possible number. The survey details various types of generating sets, including those composed of torsions, involutions, and commutators, illustrating the geometric and algebraic interplay. We unify foundational work with modern breakthroughs and extend results to punctured surfaces, $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g,p})$, providing explicit generators, relations, and proof sketches with an emphasis on geometric intuition.

## 14. $k$-type entropy of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions

**作者**: Anshid Aboobacker, Sharan Gopal

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16835.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16835.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce the concept of \(k\)-type entropy for dynamical systems generated by \(\mathbb{Z}^d\)-actions on compact metric spaces. We investigate its fundamental properties and establish connections with classical entropy and other \(k\)-type dynamical notions. The $k$-type entropy of some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions on a two dimensional torus is also calculated.

## 15. Minimal Generation of Mapping Class Groups: A Survey of the Orientable Case

**作者**: Tulin Altunoz, Mehmetcik Pamuk, Oguz Yildiz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16840.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16840.pdf)

**摘要**: The mapping class group of an orientable surface, which records its symmetries up to isotopy, plays a central role in low-dimensional topology. This chapter explores the foundational problem of determining minimal generating sets for these groups. We chart the development of this area from classical results involving Dehn twist generators to more recent breakthroughs showing that mapping class groups can be generated by just two elements, pairs of torsion elements, or a small collection of involutions. This chapter contains a discussion of the most current results for punctured surfaces, including a new improvement showing that for an even number of punctures $p\geq 8$ the group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_{13,p})$ is generated by three involutions. Throughout, we highlight the rich interplay between the algebraic features of these generating sets and the underlying geometric structures they encode. The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive account of the pursuit of algebraic and geometric efficiency within one of topology's most intricate and influential groups.

## 16. Chaos for Induced Group Actions on Hyperspaces

**作者**: Anshid Aboobacker

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16841.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16841.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper investigates the correlation between dynamical properties of group actions on compact metric spaces and their induced actions on the corresponding hyperspaces. We extend classical results from discrete dynamical systems, particularly those concerning transitivity, mixing, and chaos, to the setting of group actions.

## 17. Fully localised three-dimensional solitary water waves on Beltrami flows with strong surface tension

**作者**: Mark D. Groves, Erik Wahlén

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16843.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16843.pdf)

**摘要**: Fully localised three-dimensional solitary waves are steady water waves which are evanescent in every horizontal direction. This paper presents an existence theory for such waves under the assumptions that the relative vorticity and velocity fields are parallel (`Beltrami flows'), that the free surface of the water takes the form $\{z=\eta(x,y)\}$ for some function $\eta: {\mathbb R}^2\rightarrow{\mathbb R}$, and that the influence of surface tension is sufficiently strong. The governing equations are formulated as a single equation for $\eta$, which is then reduced to a perturbation of the KP-I equation. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate localised solutions, and an application of a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem shows that they persist under perturbations.

## 18. On the asymptotic dynamics for the $L^2$-supercritical gKDV equation

**作者**: Ricardo Freire, Claudio Muñoz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16847.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16847.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the $L^2$-supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (gKdV) with nonlinearities $p>5$. While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.

## 19. Functional uniqueness and stability of Gaussian priors in optimal L1 estimation

**作者**: Leighton Barnes, Alex Dytso

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16864.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16864.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper studies the functional uniqueness and stability of Gaussian priors in optimal $L^1$ estimation. While it is well known that the Gaussian prior uniquely induces linear conditional means under Gaussian noise, the analogous question for the conditional median (i.e., the optimal estimator under absolute-error loss) has only recently been settled. Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the Lévy metric. For $L^1$ loss, we introduce a Hermite expansion framework and analyze the adjoint of the linearity-defining operator to show that the Gaussian remains the unique stable solution. Together, these results provide a more complete functional-analytic understanding of linearity and stability in Bayesian estimation under Gaussian noise.

## 20. On the abelianization of the special derivation Lie algebras of free Lie algebras

**作者**: Naoya Enomoto, Takao Satoh

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16866.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16866.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we show that there are infinitely many linearly independent elements in the abelianization of the Lie algebra of special derivations of a free Lie algebra by using the Morita traces. Furthermore, we show that the abelianization contains non-trivial elements which are killed by the Morita traces.

## 21. The Relative Trace Formula for Galois Periods

**作者**: Siddharth Mahendraker

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16873.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16873.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $E/F$ be a quadratic extension of number fields. We introduce truncated geometric and spectral RTF distributions associated to a Galois symmetric pair $G \subset \mathrm{Res}_{E/F} G_E$, subject to the constraint that $G$ and $\mathrm{Res}_{E/F} G_E$ have the same split rank, and formulate a precise coarse RTF identity. Specializing to $SL_{2, F} \subset \mathrm{Res}_{E/F} SL_{2, E}$, we show that the truncated geometric RTF distribution converges, and is given by a linear polynomial in the truncation parameter. We then compute the fine geometric expansion explicitly, including the contribution of the regularized relative unipotent orbital integrals. We propose a geometric viewpoint which guided the computation of these unipotent terms.

## 22. On O'Grady's generalized Franchetta conjecture for genus 11 K3 surfaces

**作者**: Yuan Lu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16875.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16875.pdf)

**摘要**: O'Grady's generalized Franchetta conjecture asks whether any codimension two cycle on the universal polarized K3 surface restricts to a multiple of the Beauville--Voisin class on a given K3 surface. We apply Mukai's program for genus 11 curves and K3 surfaces, together with a result on the tautological generation of the second Chow group of the moduli space of curves, to give an affirmative answer to this conjecture in genus 11.

## 23. Hipster random walks, random series-parallel graph and random homogeneous systems

**作者**: Xinxing Chen, Thomas Duquesne, Zhan Shi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16880.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16880.pdf)

**摘要**: We study a class of random homogeneous systems. Our main result says that under suitable general assumptions, these systems converge weakly, upon a suitable normalization, to the probability distribution with density $\frac34 \, (1-x^2) \, {\bf 1}_{\{ x\in (-1, \, 1)\} }$. Two special cases are of particular interest: for the effective resistance of the critical random series-parallel graph, our result gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Hambly and Jordan (Adv. Appl. Probab. 2004) and further conjectures of Addario-Berry et al. (this http URL Related Fields 2020) and Derrida whereas for the hipster random walk, we recover a previous result of Addario-Berry et al.~(Probab. Theory Related Fields 2020).

## 24. Berezin-Toeplitz quantization revisited

**作者**: Kwokwai Chan, Naichung Conan Leung, Qin Li, Yutung Yau

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16889.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16889.pdf)

**摘要**: This is a sequel to a series of works, where we studied the local aspects of the asymptotic action of deformation quantization on the Hilbert spaces $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ of geometric quantization for a Kähler manifold $X$; here $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $X$. In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$:
(1). For a general smooth function $f \in C^\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ as $k \to \infty$. An immediate consequence is their asymptotic locality.
(2). If $f \in C^\infty(X)$ is furthermore the symbol of a level $k$ quantizable function, then we prove that the associated Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are all holomorphic differential operators. Conversely, Berezin-Toeplitz operators that are holomorphic differential operators all arise in this way. This gives a complete characterization of when Berezin-Toeplitz operators are holomorphic differential operators.
To prove these results, we construct higher order analgoues of Kostant-Souriau's pre-quantum differential operators using our Fedosov-type constructions in previous works, establish new orthogonality relations which generalize the classical Tuynman's Lemma, and employ various differential-geometric and analytic technqiues such as Hörmander's estimates.

## 25. Phase transitions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Rabi frequency (II): The De Giorgi conjecture for the nonlocal problem in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

**作者**: Leyun Wu, Chilin Zhang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16907.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16907.pdf)

**摘要**: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type.
In the present (second) paper of the series, we focus on the nonlocal problem of the form
\begin{equation*}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
(-\Delta)^{s}u+u(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+v(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
(-\Delta)^{s}v+v(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+u(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}
which models the stationary states of Rabi-coupled condensates with inter- and intra-species interactions.
We prove that for $\frac{1}{2}\le s<1$, any positive entire solution $(u,v)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying the monotonicity condition $\partial_{x_3}u>0>\partial_{x_3}v$ must be one-dimensional. Moreover, when $0<s<\frac{1}{2}$, the same conclusion holds for monotone solutions in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Our work generalizes classical De Giorgi-type theorems to a new class of nonlocal coupled systems and, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first Liouville-type classification of monotone solutions for Rabi-coupled fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, with particular emphasis on fractional Gross-Pitaevskii models.

## 26. Realizing orders in rational sphere product algebras with three generators

**作者**: Tseleung So, Donald Stanley, Stephen Theriault, Ben Williams

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16910.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16910.pdf)

**摘要**: The realization problem asks which algebras can be realized as the cohomology of spaces. We study this problem in the context of the orders in a graded rational exterior algebra on three generators. An order is a subring whose underlying additive group is a lattice. We give conditions for when such an order is realizable, and in particular show that in the simply-connected case any order is realizable if the generators of the exterior algebra are odd.

**摘要**: This paper investigates noise-robust phase retrieval by enhancing the prDeep architecture with difference of convex functions (DC) and DnCNN-based denoising regularization. This research introduces two novel algorithms, prDeep-DC and prDeep-L2, which demonstrably achieve excellent quantitative and visual performance, as confirmed by extensive numerical experiments.

## 28. Generalization of Weinstein's Morphism

**作者**: Andrés Pedroza

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16914.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16914.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce a generalization of Weinstein's morphism, defined on \pi_{2k-1}(Ham(M,\omega)) for 1 < k \leq n, where (M,\omega) is a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold. Using this morphism, we show that for n > 1 and 1 < k \leq n, the homotopy groups \pi_{2k-1}(Ham(CP^n,\omega_{FS})) and \pi_{2k-1}(Ham(\tilde CP^n,\tilde\omega_\rho)) are nontrivial. Here, (\tilde CP^n,\tilde\omega_\rho) denotes the symplectic one-point blow-up of (CP^n,\omega_FS) of weigh \rho.

## 29. An analytic study of bi-harmonic flow with a forcing term

**作者**: Mohammad Javad Habibi Vosta Kolaei

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16915.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16915.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study the evolution of smooth, closed planar curves under a fourth order biharmonic flow with an external forcing term. Such flows arise naturally in the theory of biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy. We first establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the associated initial value problem, assuming appropriate conditions on the forcing term. The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Ampére type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior. Furthermore, we prove that convexity is preserved during the evolution and derive sufficient conditions ensuring long time convergence to steady-state solutions. Our results extend recent developments in geometric analysis by clarifying the role of forcing terms in stabilizing high order curvature flows and enhancing their qualitative behavior.

## 30. The identification of the extended refined open partition function and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model

**作者**: Gehao Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16919.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16919.pdf)

**摘要**: The open intersection theory has been initiated by R. Pandharipande, J. P. Solomon and R. J. Tessler. In the scope of matrix model theory, A. Buryak and R. J. Tessler have constructed a matrix model $\mathcal{Z}^o$ for the open partition function based on a Kontsevich type combinatorial formula for the open intersection numbers found by R. J. Tessler. In this paper, using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula and operational calculus, we transform $\mathcal{Z}^o$ into another simple form, and define the matrix model $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ for the extended refined open partition function from it. The expression of $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ will immediately lead us to the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model $Z_N$ under the Miwa parametrization $s_i=2^ii!\operatorname{tr} \Lambda^{-2i-2}$. Hence it confirms the identification between the two models for general $N\geq 1$.

## 31. CBMA: Improving conformal prediction through Bayesian model averaging

**作者**: Pankaj Bhagwat, Linglong Kong, Bei Jiang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16924.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16924.pdf)

**摘要**: Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular technique for facilitating valid predictive inference across a spectrum of machine learning models, under minimal assumption of exchangeability. Recently, Hoff (2023) showed that full conformal Bayes provides the most efficient prediction sets (smallest by expected volume) among all prediction sets that are valid at the $(1 - \alpha)$ level if the model is correctly specified. However, a critical issue arises when the Bayesian model itself may be mis-specified, resulting in prediction set that might be suboptimal, even though it still enjoys the frequentist coverage guarantee. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative solution that combines Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with conformal prediction. This hybrid not only leverages the strengths of Bayesian conformal prediction but also introduces a layer of robustness through model averaging. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting prediction set will converge to the optimal level of efficiency, if the true model is included among the candidate models. This assurance of optimality, even under potential model uncertainty, provides a significant improvement over existing methods, ensuring more reliable and precise uncertainty quantification.

## 32. Stability Analysis of Grünwald Interpolation Operators on Chebyshev Nodes

**作者**: Vinaya P C

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16927.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16927.pdf)

**摘要**: In 1941, G. Grünwald proved the convergence of a sequence of operators constructed using classical Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. In this work, we establish a perturbed version of Grünwald's result, thereby extending the class of admissible nodal points. Specifically, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence when the interpolation nodes are of the form {cos eta_k} for k = 1, ..., n, where {eta_k} is a general sequence. We refer to these operators as Grünwald operators. In particular, we prove a convergence result when {eta_k} is equidistant and uniformly distributed. We establish a Voronovskaja-type estimate for the convergence of these operators and derive quantitative results involving the first and second moduli of smoothness.

## 33. Distortion of charge distribution due to internal electric fields described by the drift-diffusion semiconductor model

**作者**: Masakazu Yamamoto

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16956.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16956.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16959.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16959.pdf)

**摘要**: The cubic pancake graphs are Cayley graphs over the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}_n$ generated by three prefix reversals. There is the following open problem: characterize all the sets of three prefix reversals that generate $\mathrm{Sym}_n$. We present a partial answer to this problem, in particular, we characterize all generating sets of three elements that contain at least one of the prefix reversals $r_2, r_3, r_{n-2}$, and $r_{n-1}$. We also give some computational results relating to the diameter and the girth of some cubic pancake graphs.

## 35. On Solving Chance-Constrained Models with Gaussian Mixture Distribution

**作者**: Shibshankar Dey, Sanjay Mehrotra, Anirudh Subramanyam

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16960.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16960.pdf)

**摘要**: We study linear chance-constrained problems where the coefficients follow a Gaussian mixture distribution. We provide mixed-binary quadratic programs that give inner and outer approximations of the chance constraint based on piecewise linear approximations of the standard normal cumulative density function. We show that $O\left(\sqrt{\ln(1/\tau)/\tau} \right)$ pieces are sufficient to attain $\tau$-accuracy in the chance constraint. We also show that any desired optimality gap can be achieved under a constraint qualification condition by controlling the approximation accuracy. Extensive computations using a commercial solver show that problems with up to one thousand random coefficients specified with up to fifteen Gaussian mixture components, generated under diverse settings, can be solved to near optimality within 18 hours, while satisfying chance constraint satisfaction probabilities of up to $0.999$. The solution times are significantly lower for problems with fewer random coefficients and mixture terms. For example, problems with one hundred random coefficients, ten mixture terms, and a constraint satisfaction probability of $0.999$ can be solved in a minute or less. Sample average approximations fail to provide meaningful solutions even for the smaller problems.

## 36. Cylindric quasi-implication algebras

**作者**: Joseph McDonald

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16968.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16968.pdf)

**摘要**: In this note, we study the operation of Sasaki hook within the setting of quantum cylindric algebras by introducing cylindric quasi-implication algebras. It is first demonstrated that every quantum cylindric algebra can be converted into a cylindric quasi-implication algebra and conversely that every cylindric quasi-implication algebra gives rise to a quantum cylindric algebra. These constructions are then shown to induce an isomorphism between the category $\mathbf{CQIA}$ of cylindric quasi-implication algebras and the category $\mathbf{QCA}$ of quantum cylindric algebras. We then give two alternative constructions of a cylindric orthoframe $X_A$ from a cylindric quasi-implication algebra $A$. The first construction of $X_A$ arises via the non-zero elements of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by Harding in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of MacNeille completions. The second construction of $X_A$ arises via the proper filters of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by McDonald in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of canonical completions.

**摘要**: For a class of time-inhomogeneous SDEs with jumps, we establish criteria for the existence and uniqueness of the nonnegative solutions, and examine the extinction, the explosion together with the contractivity of the solutions, which generalize and improve upon earlier results in the literature. As an application, we study the aforementioned properties for a class of mean field SDEs.

## 38. Constancy of an Infinite Cyclotomic Product via Ramanujan Sums

**作者**: Hartosh Singh Bal

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16975.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16975.pdf)

**摘要**: We show that the infinite product defined by \[ P(z) = -\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (\Phi_n(z))^{-1/n}, \] where \( \Phi_n(z) \) is the \( n \)-th cyclotomic polynomial, is constant inside the unit disk. The proof translates a result of Ramanujan on Ramanujan sums, equivalent to the prime number theorem, to the setting of infinite products. We also show that similar identities proved by Ramanujan lead to additional results on infinite cyclotomic products.

## 39. Mercer's Theorem for Vector-Valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces in Kaplansky-Hilbert Modules over $L_{\infty}(Ω)$

**作者**: A.Arziev, K.Kudaybergenov. P.Orinbaev

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16981.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16981.pdf)

**摘要**: The study presents a vector-valued extension of the classical Mercer theorem within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined over Kaplansky-Hilbert modules associated with the algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions. The analysis focuses on a partial integral operator with a positive definite kernel depending on a measurable parameter, and establishes the equivalence of three fundamental properties: the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions in the corresponding vector-valued space, the injectivity of the adjoint embedding operator, and the existence of a pointwise spectral decomposition of the kernel in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a parameterized family of operators. The proof relies on constructing an isometric isomorphism between the Kaplansky-Hilbert module and the space of measurable sections of a Hilbert bundle, thereby reducing the problem to the application of the classical Mercer theorem on each fiber of the bundle. Furthermore, a formalism of vector-valued lifting is developed to guarantee the coherence of inner product structures between the original module and its bundle representation.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17000.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17000.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the Turán numbers of $3$-graphs avoiding $3$-graphs $F$ and $M_{s+1}^3$, a matching of size $s+1$. We disprove a conjecture of Gerbner, Tompkins, and Zhou [European Journal of Combinatorics, 2025, 127:104155] on $\ex(n,\{F,M^3_{s+1}\})$ for $3$-graph $F$ with $\chi(F)=2$ by constructing infinitely many counterexamples. For this family, we determine the asymptotic Turán number via edge-colored Turán problem. In addition, for the $3$-graph $F_{3,2}$ with edge set $\{123,145,245,345\}$, we determine the exact value of $\ex(n,\{F_{3,2}, M_{s+1}^3\})$ for every integers $s$ and all $n \ge 12s^2$.

## 42. Classification and symmetry of global solutions for nonlinear elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms

**作者**: Huyuan Chen, Florica C. Cîrstea, Aleksandar Miladinovic

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17002.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17002.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we describe the set of all positive distributional $C^1(\mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\})$-solutions of elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms of the form $$ \mathbb L_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}[u]:= \Delta u-(N-2+2\rho) \frac{x\cdot \nabla u}{|x|^2} +\lambda \frac{u^\tau |\nabla u|^{1-\tau}}{|x|^{1+\tau}}=|x|^\theta u^q\quad \mbox{in } \mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\}, $$ where $\rho,\lambda, \theta\in \mathbb R$ are arbitrary, $N\geq 2$, $q>1$ and $\tau\in [0,1)$. Defining $\beta=(\theta+2)/(q-1)$ and $f_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}(t)=t\left(t+2\rho\right) +\lambda |t|^{1-\tau}$ for $t\in \mathbb R$, we show that the equation has positive solutions if and only if $f_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}(\beta)>0$. Under this condition, we provide existence and the exact asymptotic behaviour near zero and at infinity for all positive solutions. We obtain that all such solutions are radially symmetric. When $\theta<-2$ and $\rho,\lambda\in \mathbb R$, we also find the precise local behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of our equation in $\Omega\setminus \{0\}$, where $\Omega$ is an open set containing $0$. By introducing the second term in $\mathbb L_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}[\cdot]$ with $\rho\in \mathbb R$, we reduce the study to $\theta<-2$ via a modified Kelvin transform. We reveal new and surprising phenomena compared with the work of C\^ırstea and Fărcăşeanu (2021), where $\rho=(2-N)/2$ and $\tau=1$.

## 43. On a synergistic learning phenomenon in nonparametric domain adaptation

**作者**: Ling Zhou, Yuhong Yang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17009.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17009.pdf)

**摘要**: Consider nonparametric domain adaptation for regression, which assumes the same conditional distribution of the response given the covariates but different marginal distributions of the covariates. An important goal is to understand how the source data may improve the minimax convergence rate of learning the regression function when the likelihood ratio of the covariate marginal distributions of the target data and the source data are unbounded. A previous work of Pathak et al. (2022) show that the minimax transfer learning rate is simply determined by the faster rate of using either the source or the target data alone. In this paper, we present a new synergistic learning phenomenon (SLP) that the minimax convergence rate based on both data may sometimes be faster (even much faster) than the better rate of convergence based on the source or target data only. The SLP occurs when and only when the target sample size is smaller (in order) than but not too much smaller than the source sample size in relation to the smoothness of the regression function and the nature of the covariate densities of the source and target distributions. Interestingly, the SLP happens in two different ways according to the relationship between the two sample sizes. One is that the target data help alleviate the difficulty in estimating the regression function at points where the density of the source data is close to zero and the other is that the source data (with its larger sample size than that of the target data) help the estimation at points where the density of the source data is not small. Extensions to handle unknown source and target parameters and smoothness of the regression function are also obtained.

## 44. A complete proof of the geometric Bombieri-Lang conjecture for ramified covers of abelian varieties

**作者**: Guoquan Gao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17010.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17010.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove the geometric Bombieri-Lang conjecture for projective varieties which have finite maps to abelian varieties over function fields of characteristic 0. This generalizes the recent results of Xie-Yuan, which require either the hyperbolicity assumption or the non-isotriviality assumption. The proof is based on their strategy for constructing entire curves, but requires some new ingredients from algebraic geometry and Nevanlinna theory.

## 45. A mixed fractional CIR model: positivity and an implicit Euler scheme

**作者**: Cong Zhang, Chunhao Cai

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17015.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17015.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider a Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) type short rate model driven by a mixed fractional Brownian motion. Let $M=B+B^H$ be a one-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H>1/2$, and let $\mathbf{M}=(M,\mathbb{M}^{\mathrm{It\hat{o}}})$ denote its canonical Itô rough path lift. We study the rough differential equation \begin{equation}\label{eqn1} \dd r_t = k(\theta-r_t)\,\dd t + \sigma\sqrt{r_t}\,\dd\mathbf{M}_t,\qquad r_0>0, \end{equation} and prove that, under the Feller condition $2k\theta>\sigma^2$, the unique rough path solution is almost surely strictly positive for all times. The proof relies on an Itô type formula for rough paths, together with refined pathwise estimates for the mixed fractional Brownian motion, including Lévy's modulus of continuity for the Brownian part and a law of the iterated logarithm for the fractional component. As a consequence, the positivity property of the classical CIR model extends to this non-Markovian rough path setting. We also establish the convergence of an implicit Euler scheme for the associated singular equation obtained by a square-root transformation.

**摘要**: The Wirtinger integral is one of the integral representations of the Gauss hypergeometric function. Its integrand is given by a product of complex powers of theta functions. The twisted homology and cohomology groups associated with this integral yield twisted period relations. By studying the structure of the twisted homology and cohomology groups in detail, we obtain simple forms of the relations.

## 48. Contextual Quantile Minimization for Two-Stage Stochastic Programs

**作者**: Man Yiu Tsang, Tony Sit, Hoi Ying Wong

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17020.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17020.pdf)

**摘要**: Contextual stochastic optimization is an advanced methodology to model uncertainty in the presence of contextual information during decision planning processes. Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee. Finally, through numerical experiments on a single-server appointment scheduling problem, we study the computational performance of our proposed solution method as well as operational performance of our proposed methodology. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating useful contextual information and decision-maker's risk attitude into the optimization model.

## 49. Infinite Horizon Linear Quadratic Mean Field Problems with Common Noise and Regime Switching via Conditional McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs

**作者**: Qingmeng Wei, Yaqi Xu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17023.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17023.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper studies infinite horizon linear quadratic (LQ) mean field problems with common noise and regime switching, covering both control and game formulations. To establish a theoretical foundation for the LQ framework, we first analyze fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) of conditional McKean-Vlasov type with Markovian switching and establish its well-posedness under a generalized domination-monotonicity condition. Building upon this solvability result, we then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for both the open-loop optimal control in the control problem and the mean-field Nash equilibria in the game problem.

**作者**: S. Ole Warnaar

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17034.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17034.pdf)

**摘要**: We conjecture affine or Hall-Littlewood analogues of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formulas for orthogonal and symplectic Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of maximal height. These conjectures are then used to derive $t$-analogues of many known Rogers-Ramanujan identities for the characters of standard modules of affine Lie algebras. This includes $t$-analogues of the classical Rogers-Ramanujan identities, (some of) the Andrews-Gordon identities and the $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+2}^{(2)}$ GOW identities. We also prove an affine analogue of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formula for Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of arbitrary height.

Extrapolation spaces are investigated for differential-algebraic equations, and solutions of the extrapolated DAE are characterized using augmented Wong sequences. The resulting theory is then applied to characterize infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian DAEs.

**作者**: Hanwu Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17049.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17049.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study a kind of constrained backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) such that the nonlinear expectation of the composition of a loss function and the solution remains above zero. The existence and uniqueness result is established with the help of the Skorokhod problem and the method of contraction mapping. We provide the comparison properties for the pointwise value of the solutions and the expectation of the solutions, respectively. In addition, a similar BSDE with risk measure reflection is proposed, which can be applied to the superhedging for contingent claims under risk management constraints.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17050.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17050.pdf)

**摘要**: Pólya's conjecture on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian has been one of the core problems in spectral geometry. Building upon the recent breakthrough works on Pólya's conjecture for balls and annuli by Filonov, Levitin, Polterovich and Sher, we study several aspects of Pólya's conjecture for balls and cylinders: by refining the purely analytical portion of the proof in [2] for the Neumann Pólya's conjecture for the disk, we extend the regime of the spectral parameter that can be established without computer assistance; we obtain improvement of Pólya's conjecture for disks and balls; we obtain improvement of Pólya's conjecture for cylinders and confirm the Neumann Pólya's conjecture for cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As a supplementary effort, we study Weyl's law for cylinders.

**作者**: Chek Beng Chua

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17051.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17051.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the Carathéodory number of homogeneous convex cones via their spectrahedral representations. A characterization of homogeneous convex cones whose ranks match their Carathéodory numbers is given. This characterization is then used to show that a homogeneous convex cone is selfdual if and only if its rank matches the Carathéodory numbers of both its closure and its dual cone. It is further used to show that the only sparse spectrahedral cones that are homogeneous convex cones are those described by homogeneous chordal graphs.

## 58. Stability and bifurcation of 2D viscous primitive equations with full diffusion

**作者**: Song Jiang, Quan Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17055.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17055.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper investigates the stability and bifurcation of the two-dimensional viscous primitive equations with full diffusion under thermal forcing. The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows.

## 59. Local wellposedness of the 2d Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation

**作者**: Samaël Mackowiak

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17063.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17063.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, the local wellposedness of a general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential is proven in dimension 2. The class of rough potentials we are considering is large enough to contain the spatial white noise and thus a renormalization procedure may be needed. We first construct the associated Schrödinger operator from its quadratic form. Then, the regularity of elements of its domain is explored. This allows to use a paracontrolled approach in order to obtain Strichartz estimates, which are used to prove the local wellposedness by a contraction argument.

## 60. Multidimensional quadrangle condition and cuboctahedra in latin hypercubes

**作者**: Anna A. Taranenko

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17082.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17082.pdf)

**摘要**: The well-known quadrangle criterion states that a latin square is istopic to the Cayley table of a group if and only if all quadrangles spanned by the same triple of symbols coincide in the fourth symbol. Gowers and Long (2020) reformulated it in the following way: the Cayley tables of the most associative quasigroups have the maximum number of octahedra.
In the present paper, we state the multidimensional quadrangle condition for $d$-dimensional latin hypercubes in terms of the reconstruction of subcubes of order $2$ from a bundle of $d+1$ entries and in terms of the maximal number of cuboctahedra. In particular, we show that the must associative $d$-ary quasigroups have Cayley tables such that every $2$-dimensional plane is isotopic to a latin square principally isotopic to the Cayley table of a group. We also estimate the number of cuboctahedra in latin squares and hypercubes from below and provide some computational results.

## 62. The decomposition of primes in nonabelian extensions of Heisenberg type and an analogue of Euler's criterion

**作者**: Ingyu Yang, Dohyeong Kim

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17095.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17095.pdf)

**摘要**: For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.

## 63. Subdivision of Simplicial Complex

**作者**: Sanjay Mishra

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17096.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17096.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper provides a self-contained exploration of subdivisions of simplicial complexes, with emphasis on barycentric subdivision. We present formal definitions of subdivisions, show how the realization of a complex is preserved under subdivision, and illustrate these concepts with explicit examples and detailed diagrams. The paper develops the general method of constructing subdivisions by starring from interior points, leading to the standard barycentric and derived subdivisions. We give precise statements and proofs demonstrating that repeated barycentric subdivision reduces the mesh below any prescribed scale, ensuring compatibility with given metrics and enabling applications such as simplicial approximation and homological analysis. Examples and TikZ illustrations clarify the structure of iterated subdivisions for finite complexes, highlighting their geometric and topological properties.

## 64. Central limit theorem for the range of critical branching random walk

**作者**: Tianyi Bai, Yueyun Hu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17101.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17101.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study second order fluctuations for the size of the range of a critical branching random walk (BRW) in $\mathbb Z^d$. We consider the BRW with geometric offspring indexed by the Kesten tree, and show that the size of its range has linear variance when $d>8$, and satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) with Gaussian limiting distribution when $d>16$. The proof relies on the stationarity of the model under depth-first exploration, a general CLT by Dedecker and Merlevède [7], a truncation technique exploiting the local independence of tree structures, and a recursion argument for moment bounds.

## 65. A Robust GPU-Accelerated Kernel Compensation Solver with Novel Discretization for Photonic Crystals in Pseudochiral Media

**作者**: Chenhao Jin, Hehu Xie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17107.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17107.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper develops a robust solver for the Maxwell eigenproblem in 3D photonic crystals (PCs) with pseudochiral media. The solver employs the Kernel Compensation technique under the framework of Yee's scheme to eliminate null space and enable matrix-free, GPU-accelerated operations via 3D discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Furthermore, we propose a novel discretization for permittivity tensor containing off-diagonal entries and rigorously prove that the resulting matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), which ensures the correctness of the kernel compensation technique. Numerical experiments on several benchmark examples are demonstrated to validate the robustness and accuracy of our scheme.

## 66. Parity and symmetry of polarized endomorphisms on cohomology

**作者**: Fei Hu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17109.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17109.pdf)

**摘要**: We show that the eigenvalues of any polarized endomorphism acting on the $\ell$-adic étale cohomology of a smooth projective variety satisfy certain parity and symmetry properties, as predicted by the standard conjectures. These properties were previously known for Frobenius endomorphisms. Besides the hard Lefschetz theorem, a key new ingredient is a recent Weil's Riemann hypothesis-type result due to J.~Xie. We also prove a "Newton over Hodge" type property for abelian varieties and Grassmannians.

## 67. Robustness of optimal control for controlled regime-switching diffusions with incorrect models

**作者**: Somnath Pradhan, Dinesh Rathia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17121.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17121.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper investigates the robustness of stochastic optimal control for controlled regime switching diffusions. We consider systems driven by both continuous fluctuations and discrete regime changes, allowing for model misspecification in both the diffusion and switching components. Within a unified framework, we study four classical cost formulations finite horizon, infinite-horizon discounted and ergodic costs, and the exit time cost, and establish continuity of value functions and robustness of optimal controls. Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss. The analysis relies on the regularity of the solution to the associated weakly coupled HJB systems, and their stochastic representation. The results extend the robustness framework developed for diffusion processes to a significantly broader class of hybrid systems with interacting continuous and discrete dynamics.

## 68. An efficient branch-and-cut algorithm for the multiple probabilistic covering location problem

**作者**: Yan-Ru Wang, Wei-Kun Chen, Ivana Ljubić

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17128.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17128.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we consider the multiple probabilistic covering location problem (MPCLP), which attempts to open a fixed number of facilities to maximize the total covered customer demand under a joint probabilistic coverage setting. We present a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, and develop an efficient linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm where submodular and outer-approximation inequalities are used to replace the nonlinear constraints and are separated at the nodes of the search tree. One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances. In particular, using the proposed B&C algorithm, we are able to provide optimal solutions for 57 previously unsolved benchmark instances within a time limit of one hour.

## 69. Asymptotics of motion planning complexity for control-affine systems

**作者**: Michele Motta, Dario Prandi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17130.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17130.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study the complexity of the approximation of nonadmissible curves for nonlinear control-affine systems satisfying the strong H{ö}rmander condition. Focusing on tubular approximation complexities, we provide asymptotic equivalences, with explicit constants, for all generic situations where the distribution, i.e., the linear part of the control system, is of co-rank one. Namely, we consider curves in step 2 distributions and any dimension. In the 3 dimensional case, we also consider the case of distributions with Martinet-type singularities that are crossed by the curve at isolated points.

## 70. Exact results and the structure of extremal families for the Duke--Erdős forbidden sunflower problem

**作者**: Andrey Kupavskii, Fedor Noskov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17142.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17142.pdf)

**摘要**: In 1977, Duke and Erdős asked the following general question: What is the largest size of a family $\mathtt{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ that does not contain a sunflower with $s$ petals and core of size exactly $t - 1$? This problem is closely related to the famous Erdős--Rado sunflower problem of determining the size $\phi(s,t)$ of the largest $t$-uniform family with no $s$-sunflower. In this paper, we answer this question exactly for $t=2$, odd $s$ and $k\ge 5$, provided $n$ is large enough. Previously, the only know exact extremal result on this problem was due to Chung and Frankl from 1987.
One of the important ingredients for the proof that we obtained is a stability result for the Duke--Erdős problem, which was previously not known, mostly due to our lack of understanding of the behaviour of $\phi(s,t)$.
For large $k$ and $n$ we in fact manage to reduce the Duke--Erdős problem to an Erdős--Rado-like problem which depends on $t$ and $s$ only. In particular, we get a good understanding of the structure of extremal families for the Duke--Erdős problem in terms of the Erdős--Rado problem. Previously, a much looser variant of this connection (only in terms of the sizes, rather than the structure, of respective extremal families) was established in a seminal work of Frankl and Füredi from 1987.

## 71. Isolated singularities for elliptic equations with convolution terms in a punctured ball

**作者**: Marius Ghergu, Zhe Yu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17149.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17149.pdf)

**摘要**: The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, we investigate the inequality $$ -\Delta u+V(x) u\geq f\quad\mbox{ in } B_1\setminus\{0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^N , N \geq 2, $$ where $f\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. If $V\geq 0$ is radially symmetric, we provide optimal conditions for which any solution $0\leq u\in \mathcal{C}^2(B_1\setminus\{0\})$ of the above inequality satisfies $u, \Delta u, V(x)u\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. This extends a result of H. Brezis and P.-L. Lions (1982), originally established for constant potentials $V$. Second, we investigate the equation $$\displaystyle -\Delta u + \lambda V(x) u = (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p) u^q \quad\text{in } B_1 \setminus \{0\},$$ where $0\leq V\in \mathcal{C}^{0, \nu}( \overline B_1\setminus\{0\})$, $0<\nu<1$, $\lambda, p, q>0$ and $$K_{\alpha, \beta}(x) = |x|^{-\alpha}\log^{\beta}\frac{2e}{|x|}, \quad\text{where } 0 \leq \alpha < N, \beta \in \mathbb{R}.$$ For $N \geq 3$, we establish sharp conditions on the exponents $\alpha, \beta, p, q$ under which singular solutions exist and exhibit the asymptotic behavior $u(x) \simeq |x|^{2-N}$ near the origin. For $N = 2$, we provide a classification of the existence and boundedness of solutions based on the local behavior of the potential $V(x)$ near the origin.

## 72. Combinatory Completeness in Structured Multicategories

**作者**: Ivan Kuzmin, Chad Nester, Ülo Reimaa, Sam Speight

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17152.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17152.pdf)

**摘要**: We give a general notion of combinatory completeness with respect to a faithful cartesian club and use it systematically to obtain characterisations of a number of different kinds of applicative system. Each faithful cartesian club determines a notion of structured multicategory, with the different notions of structured multicategory obtained in this way giving different notions of polynomial over an applicative system, which in turn give different notions of combinatory completeness. We obtain the classical characterisation of combinatory algebras as combinatory complete applicative systems as a specific instance.

## 73. The Güler-type acceleration for proximal gradient, linearized augmented Lagrangian and linearized alternating direction method of multipliers

**作者**: Bin Zhou, Liusheng Hou, Xingju Cai, Hailin Sun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17157.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17157.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we introduce the Güler-type acceleration technique and utilize it to propose three acceleration algorithms: the Güler-type accelerated proximal gradient method (GPGM), the Güler-type accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method (GLALM) and the Güler-type accelerated linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (GLADMM). The key idea behind these algorithms is to fully leverage the information of negative term \bm{$-\|x^k-\hat{x}^{k-1}\|^2$} in order to design the extrapolation step. This concept of using negative terms to improve acceleration can be extended to other algorithms as well. Moreover, the proposed GLALM and GLADMM enable simultaneous acceleration of both primal and dual variables. Additionally, GPGM and GLALM achieve the same convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{k^2})$ with some existing results. Although GLADMM achieves the same total convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{N})$ as in existing results, the partial convergence rate is improved from $O(\frac{1}{N^{3/2}})$ to $O(\frac{1}{N^2})$. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments on various problem instances, including the $\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, quadratic programming, and compressive sensing. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency. This also demonstrates the potential of the stochastic algorithmic versions of these algorithms in application areas such as statistics, machine learning, and data mining. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to introduce how Güler's acceleration technique can be applied to gradient-based algorithms and to provide a unified and concise framework for their construction.

## 74. The incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell two-fluid system

**作者**: Nicolas Besse, Christophe Cheverry

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17159.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17159.pdf)

**摘要**: In this text, the filtering unitary group method developed, among others, by S. Schochet is adapted to prove the existence and well-posedness of modulation equations describing the incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell Two-Fluid (EMTF) system. The reduced model captures up to the ion and electron skin depths the long-time behavior of solutions near a constant neutral background with non-zero densities. In the prepared case, the solutions of our asymptotic equations are in one-to-one correspondence with those of incompressible eXtended MagnetoHyDrodynamics (XMHD), hence providing a new basis to the XMHD framework which is currently being studied by physicists through Hamiltonian methods, see P.J. Morrison et al. By this way, we can give a simplified access to many plasma phenomena such as (a form of two-fluid) turbulence, Hall and inertial effects, as well as collisionless magnetic reconnection.

## 75. Quartic variation of the solution to the semilinear stochastic heat equation: limit behavior and asymptotic independence with respect to the data

**作者**: I Cîmpean, Yassine Nachit, Ciprian A Tudor

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17163.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17163.pdf)

**摘要**: This work concerns the limit behavior of the quartic variation (i.e., the power variation of order four) with respect to the time variable of the solution to the semilinear stochastic heat equation with space-time white noise. In a first step, we prove that this sequence satisfies a Central Limit Theorem and we deduce a similar result for the viscosity parameter estimator associated with the quartic variation. Then, by using a recent variant of the Stein-Malliavin calculus, we analyze the asymptotic independence between the quartic variation (as well as the associated viscosity parameter estimator) and the data used to construct it.

## 76. Differentially private testing for relevant dependencies in high dimensions

**作者**: Patrick Bastian, Holger Dette, Martin Dunsche

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17167.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17167.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate the problem of detecting dependencies between the components of a high-dimensional vector. Our approach advances the existing literature in two important respects. First, we consider the problem under privacy constraints. Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $\tau$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.
The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting. Additionally, under privacy constraints, state of the art procedures rely on permutation approaches that are rendered invalid under a composite null. We propose a novel bootstrap based methodology that is especially powerful in sparse settings, develop theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and show that the proposed method enjoys good finite sample properties even in the high privacy regime. Additionally, we present applications in medical data that showcase the applicability of our methodology.

## 77. Geometry of Deformations via Incidence Varieties

**作者**: Atabey Kaygun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17169.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17169.pdf)

**摘要**: We provide a unified geometric realization of the classical deformation complexes. We construct GL-equivariant bilinear incidence varieties whose diagonal slices recover the varieties of associative, commutative, Leibniz, and Lie algebra structures on a finite-dimensional vector space. We prove that the fiber of the incidence map at a given algebra law is canonically isomorphic to the space of 2-cocycles in the corresponding cohomology theory (Hochschild, Harrison, Leibniz, or Chevalley--Eilenberg). Furthermore, we introduce invariant bilinear forms to define open strata of separable and semisimple algebras, and demonstrate that these strata consist of open GL-orbits, establishing the rigidity of generic points in the coarse moduli spaces for all four geometries.

## 78. Independent sets and colorings of $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs

**作者**: Abhishek Dhawan, Oliver Janzer, Abhishek Methuku

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17191.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17191.pdf)

**摘要**: Ajtai, Erdős, Komlós, and Szemerédi conjectured in 1981 that for every graph $F$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size $\Omega(n \log d / d)$. The largest class of graphs for which this was previously known was established by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 1999, who proved it for the so-called almost bipartite graphs, namely subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$.
We prove the conjecture for all 3-colorable graphs $F$, i.e., subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress on the problem in more than 25 years. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the Rödl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Turán-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.
A closely related conjecture of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (1999) asserts that any $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has chromatic number $O(\Delta / \log \Delta)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite. We also establish this conjecture for all $3$-colorable graphs $F$, representing the first progress toward the conjecture since it was posed.

## 79. Convergence Analysis of an Endemic Time Delay Model Using Dirac and Radon Measures

**作者**: Tin Nwe Aye, Linus Carlsson

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17195.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17195.pdf)

**摘要**: This article explores the convergence properties of an $SLIR^\text{T}R^\text{P}D$ endemic model, incorporating Dirac and Radon measures, alongside distributed delays to represent latency and temporary immunity. A class of delays is defined for both continuous and discrete endemic models using continuous integral kernels with compact support and discrete terms expressed through Dirac and Radon measures. Numerical results show that the continuous model can be approximated by a discrete lag endemic model. Furthermore, the simulation time for the numerical solution is significantly shorter than that for the exact solution.

**作者**: Yang-Hui He

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17203.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17203.pdf)

**摘要**: We argue how AI can assist mathematics in three ways: theorem-proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and theoretical physics in 2017, we summarize how this emerging field has grown over the past years, and show how various machine-learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines in the mathematical sciences. At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.

## 81. On the unirationality of conic bundles with discriminant of degree eight

**作者**: Alex Casarotti, Søren Gammelgaard, Alex Massarenti

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17213.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17213.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the unirationality of surface conic bundles $\pi\colon S\to\mathbb P^1$ over an arbitrary field $k$ with discriminant degree $d_S=8$, the first case beyond the del Pezzo range. We divide these surfaces in four families and produce explicit rational multisections via tangent constructions and Cremona transformations. Over $C_1$ fields we obtain Zariski dense loci of minimal, hence non $k$-rational, yet $k$-unirational conic bundles in each family; for one of the types we prove that the dense unirational locus is indeed Zariski open. Finally, we investigate the deformation theory of these conic bundles and how their unirationality behaves under specialization.

## 82. Quadratic Mean-Field BSDEs and Exponential Utility Maximization

**作者**: Yining Ding, Kihun Nam, Jiaqiang Wen3

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17214.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17214.pdf)

**摘要**: We study real-valued mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) of the form \[ Y_t = \xi + \int_t^T \widetilde{\mathbb E}\, g(s, Z_s, \tilde Z_s)\, ds - \int_t^T Z_s \, dW_s, \] where $\tilde Z$ denotes an independent copy of $Z$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb E}$ the expectation with respect to $\tilde Z$. Under a \emph{separately quadratic} growth assumption (H\textsubscript{q}) on the generator $g$ in $(Z,\tilde Z)$, together with a bounded terminal condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions in $\mathbb S^\infty \times \mathbb H^2_{\mathrm{BMO}}$. Our approach departs from classical fixed-point arguments and instead combines Malliavin calculus with refined BMO and stability estimates: we first obtain uniform $\mathbb S^\infty$-bounds for $Z$ in a Lipschitz setting with bounded Malliavin derivative, and then pass to the quadratic case by approximation, using a stability result in $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb H^2$. This closes the gap between the quadratic BSDE results of Cheridito and Nam (2017) and Hao et al. (2025).
In the second part of the paper, we extend the framework to generators of the form $g(t,z,\tilde z,\bar z)$ satisfying a \emph{fully coupled quadratic} condition (H\textsubscript{q}$'$). In this general regime we establish existence and uniqueness under a smallness condition on the centered terminal variable. As an application, we solve a mean-field exponential utility maximization problem with a collective liability, thereby generalizing the classical utility maximization framework of Hu et al. (2005) to a fully coupled quadratic mean-field setting.

## 83. Restriction Theorem and Strichartz estimate for orthonormal functions associated with the Special Hermite Operator

**作者**: Sunit Ghosh, Jitendriya Swain

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17230.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17230.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the special Hermite operator on $\mathbb{C}^n$. As a continuation of the recent results in \cite{SG}, we establish new Strichartz estimates for systems of orthonormal functions associated with general flows of the form $e^{-it\phi(\mathcal{L})}$, where $ \phi : \mathbb{R}^{+} \to \mathbb{R} $ is a smooth function. Our approach relies on restriction estimates for the Fourier-special Hermite transform on the class of surfaces $\{(\lambda, \mu, \nu)\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{N}_0^n\times\mathbb{N}_0^n : \lambda=\phi(2|\nu|+n)\}$. We also discuss the endpoint case of the orthonormal Strichartz estimate for the Schrödinger propagator $e^{-it\mathcal{L}}$. Furthermore, we generalize restriction estimates for the special Hermite spectral projections in the context of trace ideals (Schatten spaces).

## 84. Two kinds of parametric piecewise rational interpolation kernels for image magnification

**作者**: Bing Guo, Wanfeng Qi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17232.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17232.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the constructions of piecewise rational interpolation kernels that are supported on the interval $[-2,2]$, and present one novel rational cubic/linear and five quartic/linear interpolation kernels. All proposed kernels are symmetric, $C^1$ continuous, and possess certain degrees of approximation order. The proposed quartic/linear interpolation kernels include the cubic and the cubic/linear interpolation kernel as special cases. Our numerical results show that one of the quartic/linear interpolation kernels can outperform the cubic interpolation kernel in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM.

## 86. The Star Product of Uniformly Random Codes

**作者**: Johan V. Dinesen, Ragnar Freij-Hollanti, Camilla Hollanti, Benjamin Jany, Alberto Ravagnani

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17236.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17236.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the problem of determining the expected dimension of the star product of two uniformly random linear codes that are not necessarily of the same dimension. We achieve this by establishing a correspondence between the star product and the evaluation of bilinear forms, which we use to provide a lower bound on the expected star product dimension. We show that asymptotically in both the field size q and the dimensions of the two codes, the expected dimension reaches its maximum. Lastly, we discuss some implications related to private information retrieval, secure distributed matrix multiplication, quantum error correction, and the potential for exploiting the results in cryptanalysis.

## 87. Structured Approximation of Toeplitz Matrices and Subspaces

**作者**: Albert Fannjiang, Weilin Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17239.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17239.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper studies two structured approximation problems: (1) Recovering a corrupted low-rank Toeplitz matrix and (2) recovering the range of a Fourier matrix from a single observation. Both problems are computationally challenging because the structural constraints are difficult to enforce directly. We show that both tasks can be solved efficiently and optimally by applying the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for spectral estimation. For a rank $r$ Toeplitz matrix ${\boldsymbol T}\in {\mathbb C}^{n\times n}$ that satisfies a regularity assumption and is corrupted by an arbitrary ${\boldsymbol E}\in {\mathbb C}^{n\times n}$ such that $\|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2\leq \alpha n$, our algorithm outputs a Toeplitz matrix $\widehat{\boldsymbol T}$ of rank exactly $r$ such that $\|{\boldsymbol T}-\widehat{\boldsymbol T}\|_2 \leq C \sqrt r \, \|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2$, where $C,\alpha>0$ are absolute constants. This performance guarantee is minimax optimal in $n$ and $\|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2$. We derive optimal results for the second problem as well. Our analysis provides quantitative connections between these two problems and spectral estimation. Our results are equally applicable to Hankel matrices with superficial modifications.

**作者**: Hoang Ta, Jonathan Scarlett

**摘要**: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with \(n\) nodes and \(k\) edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring \(\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)\) tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erdős--Rényi (ER) graphs \(G\sim\ER(n,q)\) in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is \(\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}\), and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) but incurs \(\Omega(n^2)\) decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra \((\log \bar{k})(\log n)\) factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) tests while attaining decoding time \(O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)\) for any fixed \(\delta>0\).

## 89. Lyapunov and Riccati Equations from a Positive System Perspective

**作者**: Dongjun Wu, Yankai Lin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17243.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17243.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a new interpretation of the Lyapunov and Riccati equations from the perspective of positive system theory. We show it is possible to construct positive systems related to these equations, and then certain conclusions -- such as the existence and uniqueness of solutions -- can be drawn from positive systems theory. Specifically, under standard observability assumptions, a strictly positive linear system can be constructed for Lyapunov equations, leading to exponential convergence in Hilbert metric to the Perron-Frobenius vector -- closely related to the solution of the Lyapunov equation. For algebraic Riccati equations, homogeneous strictly positive systems can be constructed, which exhibit more complex dynamical behaviors. While the existence and uniqueness of the solution can still be proven, only asymptotic convergence can be obtained.

## 90. Chance constrained optimization of energy intensive production as beneficial power units

**作者**: Johannes Nicklaus, Lea Brass, Gunnar Schubert

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17252.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17252.pdf)

**摘要**: We study linear policy approximations for the risk-conscious operation of an industrial energy system with uncertain wind power, significant and variable electricity demand, and high thermal output, as found in a modern foundry. The system incorporates thermal storage and operates under rolling forecasts, leading to a sequential decision-making framework. To address uncertainty in key parameters, we formulate chance-constrained optimization problems that limit the probability of critical constraint violations, such as unmet demand requirements or the exceedance of system boundaries. To reduce computational effort, we replace direct uncertainty handling with a parameter-modified cost function that approximates the underlying risk structure. We validate our method through a numerical case study, demonstrating the trade-offs between operational efficiency and reliability in a stochastic environment.

**摘要**: Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer, and $f(n)$ the number of unlabeled finite topologies on $n$ points. We prove that $f(n+m) \geq f(n) f(m)$ both for the labeled and unlabeled cases. Moreover, we prove a similar inequality for labeled and unlabeled $T_0$ topologies.

**摘要**: In this paper, we apply Fedder-type criteria for quasi-$F$-splitting to provide explicit computations of quasi-$F$-split heights for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, bielliptic surfaces, Fano varieties, and rational double points. We also find interesting phenomena concerned with inversion of adjunction, fiber products, Fano varieties, and general fibers of fibrations.

**摘要**: We describe a Python module that we developed to calculate cobordism maps induced on Khovanov homology. As applications of our program, we compute these maps for all incompressible Seifert surfaces for prime knots up to 10 crossings, and distinguish many ribbon disks arising from symmetries of the boundary knots.

## 94. Weak approximation for Gaussian processes from renewal processes

**作者**: Xavier Bardina, Salim Boukfal, Marc Cano, Carles Rovira

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17280.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17280.pdf)

**摘要**: In previous works, Bardina and Rovira (2023) constructed a family of processes that converge strongly towards Brownian motion, defined from renewal processes, are constructed. In this paper we prove that some of these processes can be utilized to build approximations of Gaussian processes such as fractional Brownian motion or multiple Stratonovich integrals and we provide sufficient conditions on renewal processes to ensure that the convergence holds. An illustrative example of such a Gaussian process is the fractional Brownian motion with any Hurst parameter.

**作者**: Xavier Bardina, Salim Boukfal

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17281.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17281.pdf)

**摘要**: In the present paper we show that the processes $X_n = \{X_n(t) \colon t \in [0,1]\}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, defined by $X_n(t) = \sqrt{n}C\int_0^t (-1)^{L(nu)} du$, where $L = \{L(t) \colon t \geq 0\}$ is a renewal processes whose inter-arrival times satisfy some integrability conditions and $C > 0$ is some normalizing constant, weakly converge, in the space of continuous functions over $[0,1]$, $\mathcal{C}([0,1])$, to the Brownian motion as $n$ approaches infinity. Thus, generalizing the result of D. W. Stroock (1982), where $L$ is taken to be a standard Poisson process. In particular, we see that these results are a mere consequence of Donsker's invariance principle.

**摘要**: This article studies regularity properties of multiplicative stochastic processes on infinite-dimensional Lie groups. We investigate conditions under which these processes admit càdlàg modifications and derive bounds on their local behavior. Our approach builds on the local equivalence of Banach-Lie groups and Banach spaces via the exponential and logarithm, allowing us to transfer analytic estimates and structural results.

## 97. Exponential matrices, $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions on projective spaces and modular representations of elementary abelian $p$-groups

**作者**: Ryuji Tanimoto

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17289.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17289.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$ and let $\mathbb{G}_a$ denote the additive group of $k$. Let $n \geq 1$ and let ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E$ denote the set of all exponential matrices of ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])$. Let $\mathbb{E}_{\geq 0}(n, k)$ denote the set of all group homomorphisms from $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^r$ to ${\rm GL}(n, k)$, where $r$ ranges over all non-negative integers. In the first, we show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E$ and the set of all $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions on $\mathbb{P}^{n - 1}$. In the second, we show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between $\mathbb{E}_{\geq 0}(n, k)$ and the set ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E \times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$.

## 98. Properties of stepwise parameter estimation in high-dimensional vine copulas

**作者**: Jana Gauss, Thomas Nagler

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17291.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17291.pdf)

**摘要**: The increasing use of vine copulas in high-dimensional settings, where the number of parameters is often of the same order as the sample size, calls for asymptotic theory beyond the traditional fixed-$p$, large-$n$ framework. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the stepwise maximum likelihood estimator for vine copulas when the number of parameters diverges as $n \to \infty$. Our theoretical results cover both parametric and nonparametric estimation of the marginal distributions, as well as truncated vines, and are also applicable to general estimation problems, particularly other sequential procedures. Numerical experiments suggest that the derived assumptions are satisfied if the pair copulas in higher trees converge to independence copulas sufficiently fast. A simulation study substantiates these findings and identifies settings in which estimation becomes challenging. In particular, the vine structure strongly affects estimation accuracy, with D-vines being more difficult to estimate than C-vines, and estimates in Gumbel vines exhibit substantially larger biases than those in Gaussian vines.

## 99. A Semismooth Newton Solver and its application to an $hp$-FE Discretization in Elastoplasticity

**作者**: Patrick Bammer, Lothar Banz, Miriam Schönauer, Andreas Schröder

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17295.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17295.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we consider a class of systems of nonlinear equations, which arise in discretized mixed formulations of problems in solid mechanics by $hp$-finite elements. We introduce a semismooth Newton solver for this specific class and prove its well-definedness and local convergence. Thereby, the analysis heavily relies on a special eigenvalue interplay of two matrices involved in the considered nonlinear system. Next, we apply the general results to an $hp$-finite element discretization of a problem in elastoplasticity, which can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations of the above type by using biorthogonal basis functions. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed semismooth Newton solver with respect to $h$ and $p$.

## 100. The relationship between local derivations and local automorphisms of some associative algebras

**作者**: Farkhodzhon Arzikulov, Utkir Khakimov, Abduqaxxor Qurbonov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17316.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17316.pdf)

**摘要**: In the present paper local derivations and local automorphisms of five-dimensional naturally graded nilpotent associative algebras are studied. Namely, a general form of the matrices of local derivations and local automorphisms of algebras $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ is clarified. It turns out that the general form of the matrix of an automorphism (derivation) on these algebras does not coincide with the local automorphism's (resp. local derivation's) matrix's general form on these algebras. Therefore, these associative algebras have local automorphisms (resp. local derivations) that are not automorphisms (resp. derivations). We also establish a relationship between local automorphisms and local derivations via an exponential expression. We prove that the sets of local derivations of algebras $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ form Lie algebras with respect to the Lie brackets. Thus, we show that the Lie algebra problem from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems for local derivations of the algebras under consideration has a positive solution. The other problems from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems have a positive (negative) solution for algebra $\pi_2$ (resp. algebra $\pi_3$)

## 101. ATMPlace: Analytical Thermo-Mechanical-Aware Placement Framework for 2.5D-IC

**作者**: Qipan Wang, Tianxiang Zhu, Tianyu Jia, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17319.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17319.pdf)

**摘要**: Rising demand in AI and automotive applications is accelerating 2.5D IC adoption, with multiple chiplets tightly placed to enable high-speed interconnects and heterogeneous integration. As chiplet counts grow, traditional placement tools, limited by poor scalability and reliance on slow simulations, must evolve beyond wirelength minimization to address thermal and mechanical reliability, critical challenges in heterogeneous integration. In this paper, we present ATMPlace, the first analytical placer for 2.5D ICs that jointly optimizes wirelength, peak temperature, and operational warpage using physics-based compact models. It generates Pareto optimal placements for systems with dozens of chiplets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance: 146 percent and 52 percent geometric mean wirelength improvement over TAP 2.5D and TACPlace, respectively, with 3 to 13 percent lower temperature and 5 to 27 percent less warpage, all achieved approximately 10 times faster. The proposed framework is general and can be extended to enable fast, scalable, and reliable design exploration for next-generation 2.5D systems.

## 102. Superconformal topological recursion

**作者**: Nezhla Aghaei, Reinier Kramer, Nicolas Orantin, Kento Osuga

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17320.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17320.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate a supersymmetric generalisation of topological recursion from two perspectives: algebraic and geometric. The algebraic side concerns a recursive structure encoded in modules of a super Virasoro algebra, and the geometric counterpart is what we call superconformal topological recursion defined on a super Riemann surface. Superconformal topological recursion indicates that odd holomorphic one-forms on a super Riemann surface are related to zero modes of copies of the Clifford algebras, and it also provides a tool to study deformation of non-split super Riemann surfaces, e.g. certain families of super Riemann surfaces carrying odd parameters. On a super Riemann surface over a non-reduced base, the formalism is recursive not only in terms of pants-decomposition but also in terms of odd parameters in a suitable sense.

## 103. Boundary regularity and a priori estimates for fractional equations on unbounded domains

**作者**: Yahong Guo, Congming Li, Yugao Ouyang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17325.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17325.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study the boundary Hölder regularity for solutions to the fractional Dirichlet problem in unbounded domains with boundary \begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
(-\Delta)^s u(x) = g(x),&\text{in } \Omega,
u(x)=0, &\text{in } \Omega^c.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*} Existing results rely on the global $L^{\infty}$ norm of solutions to control their boundary $C^s$ norm, which is insufficient for blow-up and rescaling analysis to obtain a priori estimates in unbounded domains. To overcome this limitation, we first derive a local version of boundary Hölder regularity for nonnegative solutions in which we replace the global $L^{\infty}$ norm by only a local $L^{\infty}$ norm. Then as an important application, we establish a priori estimates for nonnegative solutions to a family of nonlinear equations on unbounded domains with boundaries.

## 104. Existence and Uniqueness of Fast Traveling Pulses in Singularly Perturbed Nonlocal Neural Fields With Heaviside Nonlinearities: a Complete Proof

**作者**: Alan Dyson

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17328.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17328.pdf)

**摘要**: We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of fast traveling pulse solutions to the singularly perturbed neural field system with linear feedback and Heaviside nonlinearity structure within a spatial convolution. The pulse is well-accepted to generally exist based on its original singular construction, closed form when it exists, and follow-ups, but prior to this study, there has not been a proof that overcomes the difficulties of (i) solving for the speed and width functions using the implicit function theorem at $\epsilon=0$ and (ii) tracking the resultant formal homoclinic orbit near its singular orbit during fast, slow, and mixed time scales. First, we provide new, first-order approximations of the pulse speed and width. We then show that the formal pulse is close to the front and back at threshold crossing points and that the Hausdorff distance between the formal pulse and the singular homoclinic orbit converges to zero, demonstrating that the formal pulse is a true solution to the original system.

## 105. A Proof of Talagrand's Creating Large Sets Conjecture

**作者**: Xuan Fang, Tianyu Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17336.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17336.pdf)

**摘要**: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.

**作者**: Filippo Giannoni

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17343.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17343.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove a sampling theorem for infinite-dimensional Paley-Wiener spaces on graphs which allows for stable frame reconstruction. We prove that all sampling sets for a fixed Paley-Wiener space are complements of lambda-sets (i.e. sets where a Poincaré-type inequality holds), thereby providing a sufficient condition for stable sampling and reconstruction on graphs such as $\mathbb{Z}^n$-lattices and radial trees with finite geometry.

## 107. A Conservative Cascade Semi-Lagrangian Method for Solving the Vlasov Equation

**作者**: Chunyang Xu, Michel Mehrenberger, Chang Yang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17347.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17347.pdf)

**摘要**: The cascade remapping method, originally proposed by Nair et al. (2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17352.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17352.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove that the generic fibre of the Betti moduli space associated to any of the ten Painlevé equations coincides with the result of attaching Weinstein handles along the Stokes Legendrian, and provide Weinstein handlebody diagrams for each of them in the process. We moreover extend the procedure for obtaining presentations in Gompf normal form of Weinstein manifolds obtained by attaching handles to Legendrian lifts of cooriented curves in surfaces to their unit cotangent bundle to the case where the surface may have nonempty boundary.

## 109. Explicit solutions to the gradient flow of Spin(7)-structures

**作者**: Joseph Duthie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17356.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17356.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the gradient flow of Spin($7$)-structures and construct the first explicit solutions, in the homogeneous setting. As an intermediate step, we obtain formulae expressing the Spin($7$)-torsion tensor and gradient flow in terms of the Spin($7$)-torsion forms, which makes explicit computations more tractable. We use these formulae to find explicit solutions to the gradient flow of Spin($7$)-structures, obtaining a shrinking soliton on $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ as well as another explicit solution on a certain $T^7$-bundle over $S^1$. We also find an explicit solution to the coupled Ricci-harmonic flow of Spin($7$)-structures. Finally, we consider the question of stability of solitons for the renormalised gradient flow, and show that the soliton on $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ admits stable directions, unstable directions, and zero modes.

## 110. Feynman spectral action of the wave operator on asymptotically de Sitter spaces

**作者**: Ruben Zeitoun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17359.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17359.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we investigate the wave operator $\square_g$ on non-trapping (at all energies) even asymptotically de Sitter spaces. We construct a Feynman operator on the conformal extension of asymptotically de Sitter spaces and give a proof of uniform microlocal estimates for the Feynman operator in this setting. This enables the study of the Lorentzian "spectral" zeta functions in asymptotically de Sitter and the construction of a "spectral" action of the Feynman propagator.

## 111. A note on zero-cycles on bielliptic surfaces

**作者**: Evangelia Gazaki

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17365.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17365.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the Chow group of zero-cycles $\text{CH}_0(S)$ of a bielliptic surface $S=(E_1\times E_2)/G$, where $E_1, E_2$ are elliptic curves and $G$ is a finite group acting on $E_1$ by translations and on $E_2$ by automorphisms such that $E_2/G\simeq\mathbb{P}^1$. We show that if $S$ is defined over an arbitrary field $k$ of characteristic not equal to $2,3$, then the kernel of the Albanese map $\text{alb}_S:\text{CH}_0(S)^{\text{deg}=0}\rightarrow \text{Alb}_S(k)$ is a torsion group of exponent $2^2\cdot|G|$ or $3^2\cdot|G|$, depending on the type of bielliptic surface. We also construct explicit examples over $p$-adic fields that illustrate that this kernel can have nontrivial elements obtained by push-forward from the abelian surface.

## 112. Roman ${2}$-domination on Graphs with "few" 4-paths

**作者**: Lara Fernández, Valeria Leoni

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17369.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17369.pdf)

**摘要**: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, $f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ is a \emph{Roman $\{2\}$-dominating function} (or \emph{italian dominating function}) of $G$ if for every vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v) =0$, either there exists a vertex $u$ adjacent to $v$ with $f(u) = 2$, or two distinct vertices $x,\; y$ both adjacent to $v$ with $f(x)=f(y)=1$. The decision problem associated with Roman $\{2\}$-domination is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs (Chellali et al., 2016).
In this work we initiate the study of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on graph classes with a limited number of 4-paths. We base our study on a modular decomposition analysis. In particular, we study Roman $\{2\}$-domination under some operations in graphs such as join, union, complementation, addition of pendant vertices and addition of twin vertices. We then obtain the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of spiders, well-labelled spiders and certain prime split graphs that are crucial in the modular decomposition of partner-limited graphs. In all, we provide linear-time algorithms to compute the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of cographs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, $P_4$-tidy graphs and partner-limited graphs. Finally, we derive the NP-completeness of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on $P_4$-laden graphs.

## 113. Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of decorated vector bundles

**作者**: Emanuel Roth, Florent Schaffhauser

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17371.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17371.pdf)

**摘要**: A decorated vector bundle is a vector bundle equipped with a reduction of structure group to a complex reductive subgroup $G \subseteq \mathbf{GL}(r;\mathbb{C})$. Examples include symplectic and special-orthogonal vector bundles, as well as vector bundles with trivial determinants. In this expository paper, we provide direct constructions of Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of symplectic and special-orthogonal vector bundles, and use them to construct canonical reductions as done by Atiyah and Bott. We compare these canonical reductions to those constructed by Biswas and Holla. Lastly, we set up the obstruction theory necessary to define Harder-Narasimhan types of principal bundles, and stratify the moduli stack of principal $G$-bundles.

## 114. Abstract fractional linear transformations

**作者**: David Handelman

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17383.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17383.pdf)

**摘要**: We begin with (densely-defined) fractional linear transformations (FLT) on (some) Banach algebras and their relatives. This leads to Wedderburn's continued fractions (recursively-defined noncommutative polynomials) for any ring. Along the way, we discover a one-parameter family of (noncommutative) polynomials \st if one of them is invertible, then read in the opposite order, the corresponding polynomial is also invertible (extending the well known $1+ab$ is invertible if $1+ ba$ is, and the not-so-well-known, $a + abc + c$ and $a + cba + c$).
This in turn leads to a definition of FLT for general rings $R$, which turns out to be PE$(2,R)$ (the projective elementary group). Using Wedderburn's polynomials, this permits us to define a length function on PE$(2,R)$, which suggests a stable range type condition (for $n =1$, it {\it is\/} stable range one, but higher values do not correspond.
Again using the length results, we prove the expected results for PE$(2,R)$: under very modest conditions on $R$, the commutator subgroup of PE$(2,R)$ is perfect and of index one or two.
Along the same lines, we also prove results on simplicity of the commutator subgroup: we require the usual generative properties on the simple ring $R$, as well either the very restrictive $1$ in the range, or a mild condition about invertibles, involving intersections of three translates of GL$(1,R)$. This last property is explored in the appendices, which give examples (and non-examples).
Numerous questions suggest themselves throughout.

## 115. Background on real and complex elliptically symmetric distributions

**作者**: Jean-Pierre Delmas

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17394.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17394.pdf)

**摘要**: This chapter presents a short overview of real elliptically symmetric (RES) distributions, complemented by circular complex elliptically symmetric (C-CES) and noncircular CES (NC-CES) distributions as complex representations of RES distributions. These distributions are both an extension of the multivariate Gaussian distribution and a multivariate extension of univariate symmetric distributions. They are equivalently defined through their characteristic functions and their stochastic representations, which naturally follow from the spherically symmetric distributions after affine transformations. Particular attention is paid to the absolutely continuous case and to the subclass of compound Gaussian distributions. Results related to moments, affine transformations, marginal and conditional distributions, and summation stability are also presented. Some well-known instances of RES distributions are provided with their main properties. Finally, the estimation of the symmetry center and scatter matrix is briefly discussed through the sample mean (SM), sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimate, maximum estimate (ML), $M$-estimators, and Tyler's $M$-estimators. Particular attention will be paid to the asymptotic Gaussianity of the $M$-estimators of the scatter matrix. To conclude, some hints about the Slepian-Bangs formula are provided.

## 116. Perfect Sets of Liouville Numbers with Controlled Self-Powers

**作者**: Sidney A. Morris, Marcelo O. Ribeiro, Diego Marques

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17414.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17414.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the arithmetic behavior of self-powers $x^x$ when $x$ is a Liouville number. Using recent ideas on strengthened Liouville approximation, we develop flexible constructions that illuminate how transcendence, Liouville properties, and "large" topological size interact in this setting. As a concrete outcome, we build a perfect set of Liouville numbers of continuum cardinality whose finite sums, finite products, and self-powers all remain Liouville. These results show that rich algebraic and topological structures persist inside the Liouville universe for the map $x\mapsto x^x$.

## 117. Fluid Antenna System-Enabled UAV-to-Ground Communications

**作者**: Xusheng Zhu, Kai-Kit Wong, Qingqing Wu, Hyundong Shin, Yangyang Zhang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17416.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17416.pdf)

**摘要**: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a revolutionary technology offering enhanced spatial diversity within a compact form factor. Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing. This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an $N$-port FAS operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel. By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$. Simulation results are provided to validate the high accuracy of our entire theoretical framework.

## 118. On the Convergence of Constrained Gradient Method

**作者**: Danqing Zhou, Hongmei Chen, Shiqian Ma, Junfeng Yang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17430.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17430.pdf)

**摘要**: The constrained gradient method (CGM) has recently been proposed to solve convex optimization and monotone variational inequality (VI) problems with general functional constraints. While existing literature has established convergence results for CGM, the assumptions employed therein are quite restrictive; in some cases, certain assumptions are mutually inconsistent, leading to gaps in the underlying analysis. This paper aims to derive rigorous and improved convergence guarantees for CGM under weaker and more reasonable assumptions, specifically in the context of strongly convex optimization and strongly monotone VI problems. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided to verify the validity of CGM and demonstrate its efficacy in addressing such problems.

## 119. On gap properties for the linearized 1D Dirac--Soler model

**作者**: Danko Aldunate, Julien Ricaud, Edgardo Stockmeyer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17451.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17451.pdf)

**摘要**: We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}$, $p>0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2\omega$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p<1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance.

## 120. Unmarked spectral rigidity of expanding circle maps

**作者**: Kostiantyn Drach, Vadim Kaloshin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17452.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17452.pdf)

**摘要**: For a smooth expanding map $f$ of the circle, its (unmarked) length spectrum is defined as the set of logarithms of multipliers of periodic orbits of $f$. This spectrum is analogous to the set of lengths of all closed geodesics on negatively curved surfaces -- the classical length spectrum. In the paper, we prove a length spectral rigidity result for expanding circle maps. Namely, we show that a smooth expanding circle map $f$ of degree $d \ge 2$, under certain assumptions on the sparsity of its length spectrum, cannot be perturbed with an arbitrarily small perturbation (depending on $f$) so that its length spectrum stays the same. The proof uses the Whitney extension theorem, a quantitative Livsic-type theorem, and a novel iterative scheme.

**作者**: Ivan Proskurnin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17453.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17453.pdf)

**摘要**: S.P. Chulkov has proven that if the Taylor series of $f$ contains no monomials of degree $\leq 2$ then $\mu(f) \geq p-1$ for any function germ $f$ invariant with respect to a nontrivial action of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for prime $p$. Here we present a generalization of this inequality for actions of arbitrary abelian groups.

## 122. Fermat near misses and the integral Hilbert Property

**作者**: Jessica Alessandrì, Daniel Loughran

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17456.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17456.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 - w^2 = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, which is related to near misses for the quartic case of Fermat's Last Theorem. For certain $n$ we show that the set of solutions is infinite, or more generally not thin. Our approach is via the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, and we prove a more general result on non-thinness of integral points on double conic bundle surfaces.

**作者**: Dilara Erdemir, Suat Koç, Ünsal Tekir, Mesut Buğday

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17465.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17465.pdf)

**摘要**: Let R be a commutative ring with unity and M be an R-module. In this study, we construct the \tilde{Spec}(M) topology using the prime spectrum of module M and multiplicatively closed subsets of R with the closed sets \tilde{V}(S)={P \in Spec(M) : (P : M) \cap S_i \neq \emptyset for all i \in I} with the open sets \tilde{D}(S_i):={P \in Spec(M) : (P : M) \cap S_i = \emptyset} where S = {S_i}_{i \in I} is a family of multiplicatively closed subsets of R. We investigate connections between the algebraic properties of R-module M and the topological properties of \tilde{Spec}(M). We examine specifically the separation axioms, connectivity, nested and Lindelöf property together with quasi-compactness as well as the isolated, closure, interior and limit points of tilde{Spec}(M). Moreover, in the last section, we provide an example of a Lindelöf space which is not quasi-compact by means of \tilde{Spec}(M).

## 124. Stabilization and control of the nonlinear plate equation

**作者**: Cristóbal Loyola

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17468.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17468.pdf)

**摘要**: In this article we prove semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability results for nonlinear plate equations with hinged boundary conditions and analytic nonlinearity. These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schrödinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17471.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17471.pdf)

**摘要**: We demonstrate inflation of Fourier--Lebesgue norms for solutions to the focusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation posed on the real line. For $p\neq 2$ and all $s\in \mathbb{R}$, we construct a sequence of solutions $u_n$ whose initial data $u_n(0)$ converges to zero in the Fourier--Lebesgue spaces $\mathcal F L^p_s(\mathbb{R})$, but whose evolutions at later times $t_n$ diverge to infinity.

## 126. The Atlas Model and SDEs with Boundary Interaction

**作者**: Philipp Jettkant

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17486.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17486.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the mean-field limit of the Atlas model and its connection to SDEs with dependence on the distribution of hitting and local times. The Atlas model describes a system of Brownian particles on the real line, where only the lowest ranked particle receives a positive drift, proportional to the number of particles. We show that in the mean-field limit the particle system converges to a novel SDE with reflection at a moving boundary, whose motion is such that the average local time spent at the boundary grows at a constant rate. In general, the boundary is represented by a measure, so the reflection must be interpreted in a relaxed sense. However, for sufficiently regular initial particle profiles, we prove that the boundary is a continuous function. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the problem via McKean--Vlasov SDEs with interaction through hitting and local times.

## 127. Classification of analytic $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$-actions on closed $(p+q-1)$-dimensional manifolds I : $p, q \geq 3$

**作者**: Spyridon Lentas

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17495.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17495.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper provides a classification of analytic actions of the semi-orthogonal group $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$, for $p,q \geq 3$, on closed, connected $(p+q-1)$-dimensional manifolds. Adapting Uchida's construction of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ actions on $\text{S}^{p+q-1}$, we explicitly construct analytic actions of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ on $\text{S}^{p} \times \text{S}^{q-1}$ and $\text{S}^{p-1} \times \text{S}^{q}$, as well as actions on $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q) \times_P \text{S}^1$, where $P$ is a maximal parabolic subgroup of $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$. The main result demonstrates that any analytic $\text{SO}^\circ(p,q)$ action on a closed, connected $(p+q-1)$-dimensional manifold is covered by one of the constructed actions.

## 128. Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs

**作者**: Chinonso Onah, Roman Firt, Kristel Michielsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14296.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14296.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.

## 129. Chemical Systems as Ternary $Γ$-Semirings:Theory, Case Studies, and Operational Tests

**作者**: Chandrasekhar Gokavarapu, Venkata Rao Kaviti, Srinivasa Rao Thirunagari, D. Madhusudhana Rao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16697.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16697.pdf)

**摘要**: Chemical systems are traditionally described by lists of species, reactions, and externally imposed kinetic laws, a framework that lacks an intrinsic algebraic structure governing how transformations compose. We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices. The resulting framework unifies equilibrium, kinetics, regulation, and chemical computation within a single algebraic language, offering new principles for the analysis and design of responsive or self-regulating materials.

## 130. A Coq-based Axiomatization of Tarski's Mereogeometry

**作者**: Patrick Barlatier, Richard Dapoigny

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16705.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16705.pdf)

**摘要**: During the last decade, the domain of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, has known a renewal of interest for mereogeometry, a theory that has been initiated by Tarski. Mereogeometry relies on mereology, the Lesniewski's theory of parts and wholes that is further extended with geometrical primitives and appropriate definitions. However, most approaches (i) depart from the original Lesniewski's mereology which does not assume usual sets as a basis, (ii) restrict the logical power of mereology to a mere theory of part-whole relations and (iii) require the introduction of a connection relation. Moreover, the seminal paper of Tarki shows up unclear foundations and we argue that mereogeometry as it is introduced by Tarski, can be more suited to extend the whole theory of Lesniewski. For that purpose, we investigate a type-theoretical representation of space more closely related with the original ideas of Lesniewski and expressed with the Coq language. We show that (i) it can be given a more clear foundation, (ii) it can be based on three axioms instead of four and (iii) it can serve as a basis for spatial reasoning with full compliance with Lesniewski's systems.

## 131. Tableau methodology for propositional logics

**作者**: T. Jarmuzek, R. Gore

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16781.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16781.pdf)

**摘要**: We set out a general methodology for producing tableau systems for propositional logics via a tableau metatheory that provides general and formal notions for different tableau systems that vary by semantics or formulae. Moreover, by dint of these general notions, some facts, independent of their applications to a particular propositional logic, can be proved. One of the examples is the tableau metatheorem that simplifies the process of constructing a complete tableau system for a given logic, just reducing it to checking specific properties of the tableau rules within the analyzed, particular system. In our paper we generalize an abstract consistency property proposed by R. Smullyan and M. Fitting from the modal case to the others. Such a methodology is essential for a deeper and universal treatment of tableau methods for various propositional languages and semantics.

## 132. Labeled histories and maximally probable labeled topologies with multifurcation

**作者**: Emily H. Dickey, Noah A. Rosenberg

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16799.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16799.pdf)

**摘要**: In mathematical phylogenetics, labeled histories describe the sequences by which sets of labeled lineages coalesce to a shared ancestral lineage. We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees. Consider a rooted leaf-labeled tree in which internal nodes each have $i$ offspring, and $i$ is permitted to range from 2 to $r$ across internal nodes, for a specified value of $r$. For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology. The computations contribute to the study of multifurcation, which arises in various biological processes, and they connect to analogous mathematical settings involving precedence-constrained scheduling.

## 133. A model for mosquito-borne epidemic outbreaks with information-dependent protective behaviour

**作者**: Simone De Reggi, Andrea Pugliese, Mattia Sensi, Cinzia Soresina

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16802.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16802.pdf)

**摘要**: We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.

## 134. Cubical coherent confluence, cubical $ω$-groupoids and the cube equation

**作者**: Philippe Malbos, Tanguy Massacrier, Georg Struth

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16852.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16852.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the confluence property of abstract rewriting systems internal to cubical categories. We introduce cubical contractions, a higher-dimensional generalisation of reductions to normal forms, and employ them to construct cubical polygraphic resolutions of convergent rewriting systems. Within this categorical framework, we establish cubical proofs of fundamental rewriting results -- Newman's lemma, the Church-Rosser theorem, and Squier's coherence theorem -- via the pasting of cubical coherence cells. We moreover derive, in purely categorical terms, the cube law known from the $\lambda$-calculus and Garside theory. As a consequence, we show that every convergent abstract rewriting system freely generates an acyclic cubical groupoid, in which higher-dimensional generators can be replaced by degenerate cells beyond dimension two.

## 135. Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Extracting Maximum-Size $(k,\ell)$-Sparse Subgraphs

**作者**: Péter Madarasi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16877.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16877.pdf)

**摘要**: A multigraph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, \ell)$-sparse if every subset $X \subseteq V$ induces at most $\max\{k|X| - \ell, 0\}$ edges. Finding a maximum-size $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library.

## 136. Approximate Least-Favorable Distributions and Nearly Optimal Tests via Stochastic Mirror Descent

**作者**: Andrés Aradillas Fernández, José Blanchet, José Luis Montiel Olea, Chen Qiu, Jörg Stoye, Lezhi Tan

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16925.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16925.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider a class of hypothesis testing problems where the null hypothesis postulates $M$ distributions for the observed data, and there is only one possible distribution under the alternative. We show that one can use a stochastic mirror descent routine for convex optimization to provably obtain - after finitely many iterations - both an approximate least-favorable distribution and a nearly optimal test, in a sense we make precise. Our theoretical results yield concrete recommendations about the algorithm's implementation, including its initial condition, its step size, and the number of iterations. Importantly, our suggested algorithm can be viewed as a slight variation of the algorithm suggested by Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2015), whose theoretical performance guarantees are unknown.

## 137. Optimising pandemic response through vaccination strategies using neural networks

**作者**: Chang Zhai, Ping Chen, Zhuo Jin, David Pitt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16932.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16932.pdf)

**摘要**: Epidemic risk assessment poses inherent challenges, with traditional approaches often failing to balance health outcomes and economic constraints. This paper presents a data-driven decision support tool that models epidemiological dynamics and optimises vaccination strategies to control disease spread whilst minimising economic losses. The proposed economic-epidemiological framework comprises three phases: modelling, optimising, and analysing. First, a stochastic compartmental model captures epidemic dynamics. Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure. By employing this three-phase framework, policymakers can adjust input values to reflect evolving transmission dynamics and continuously update strategies, thereby minimising aggregate costs, aiding future pandemic preparedness.

## 138. Gradient flow for deep equilibrium single-index models

**作者**: Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16976.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16976.pdf)

**摘要**: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.

## 140. Teaching quantum computing to computer science students: Review of a hands-on quantum circuit simulation practical

**作者**: Florian Krötz, Xiao-Ting Michelle To, Korbinian Staudacher, Dieter Kranzlmüller

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17218.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17218.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.

## 141. Fundamental Limitations of QAOA on Constrained Problems and a Route to Exponential Enhancement

**作者**: Chinonso Onah, Kristel Michielsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17259.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17259.pdf)

**摘要**: We study fundamental limitations of the generic Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on constrained problems where valid solutions form a low dimensional manifold inside the Boolean hypercube, and we present a provable route to exponential improvements via constraint embedding. Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems.

## 142. Survival and invasion dynamics in cell populations: an analytical framework for threshold behaviour in nonlinear age-structured models

**作者**: Stéphanie M. C. Abo, Ruth E. Baker

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17279.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17279.pdf)

**摘要**: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.
We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.

## 143. A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation

**作者**: Andrea Medaglia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17286.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17286.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.

## 144. Computing the Hard Scaled Relative Graph of LTI Systems

**作者**: Julius P. J. Krebbekx, Eder Baron-Prada, Roland Tóth, Amritam Das

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17297.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17297.pdf)

**摘要**: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems, where Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems are the fundamental building block. To analyze feedback loops with unstable LTI components, the hard SRG is required, since it aptly captures the input/output behavior on the extended $L_2$ space. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational method to exactly compute the hard SRG of LTI systems, which may be unstable and contain integrators. We also study its connection to the Nyquist criterion, including the multivariable case, and demonstrate our method on several examples.

## 145. Convergence and stability of Q-learning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

**作者**: Massimiliano Manenti, Andrea Iannelli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17351.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17351.pdf)

**摘要**: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.

## 146. Characterizing Sets of Theories That Can Be Disjointly Combined

**作者**: Benjamin Przybocki, Guilherme V. Toledo, Yoni Zohar

**摘要**: We study properties that allow first-order theories to be disjointly combined, including stable infiniteness, shininess, strong politeness, and gentleness. Specifically, we describe a Galois connection between sets of decidable theories, which picks out the largest set of decidable theories that can be combined with a given set of decidable theories. Using this, we exactly characterize the sets of decidable theories that can be combined with those satisfying well-known theory combination properties. This strengthens previous results and answers in the negative several long-standing open questions about the possibility of improving existing theory combination methods to apply to larger sets of theories. Additionally, the Galois connection gives rise to a complete lattice of theory combination properties, which allows one to generate new theory combination methods by taking meets and joins of elements of this lattice. We provide examples of this process, introducing new combination theorems. We situate both new and old combination methods within this lattice.

## 147. On treating right-censoring events like treatments

**作者**: Lan Wen, Aaron L. Sarvet, Jessica G. Young

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17379.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17379.pdf)

**摘要**: In causal inference literature, potential outcomes are often indexed by the "elimination of all right-censoring events," leading to the perception that such a restriction is necessary for defining well-posed causal estimands. In this paper, we clarify that this restriction is not required: a well-defined estimand can be formulated without indexing on the elimination of such events. Achieving this requires a more precise classification of right-censoring events than has historically been considered, as the nature of these events has direct implications for identification of the target estimand. We provide a framework that distinguishes different types of right-censoring events from a causal perspective, and demonstrate how this framework relates to censoring definitions and assumptions in classical survival analysis literature. By bridging these perspectives, we provide a clearer understanding of how to handle right-censoring events and provide guidance for identifying causal estimands when right-censored events are present.

## 148. Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime

**作者**: Patricia Ribes-Metidieri, Ivan Agullo, Béatrice Bonga

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17382.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17382.pdf)

**摘要**: Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.

## 149. Frobenius Revivals in Laplacian Cellular Automata: Chaos, Replication, and Reversible Encoding

**作者**: Małgorzata Nowak-Kępczyk

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17389.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17389.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate Frobenius-driven revivals in prime-modulus Laplacian cellular
automata, a phenomenon in which long chaotic transients collapse into exact,
multi-tile replicas of an initial seed at algebraically prescribed times
$t=p^m$.
The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity
$(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces
deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion.
We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these
revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial
organisation, and local stability under perturbations.
The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions
between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust
reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise.
We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes
generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact
reversibility.
Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding
scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with
practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates.
Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured
pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural
pattern synthesis.
The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and
cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and
applied development.

## 150. Empirical universality and non-universality of local dynamics in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model

**作者**: Grace Liu, Dmitriy Kunisky

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17428.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17428.pdf)

**摘要**: Several recent works have aimed to design algorithms for optimizing the Hamiltonians of spin glass models from statistical physics. While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search.

## 151. A Framework for Adaptive Stabilisation of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems

**作者**: Seth Siriya, Jingge Zhu, Dragan Nešić, Ye Pu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17436.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17436.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.

## 152. Iterating marginalized Bayes maps for likelihood maximization with application to nonlinear panel models

**作者**: Jesse Wheeler, Aaron J. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17438.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17438.pdf)

**摘要**: Complex dynamic systems can be investigated by fitting mechanistic stochastic dynamic models to time series data. In this context, commonly used Monte Carlo inference procedures for model selection and parameter estimation quickly become computationally unfeasible as the system dimension grows. The increasing prevalence of panel data, characterized by multiple related time series, therefore necessitates the development of inference algorithms that are effective for this class of high-dimensional mechanistic models. Nonlinear, non-Gaussian mechanistic models are routinely fitted to time series data but seldom to panel data, despite its widespread availability, suggesting that the practical difficulties for existing procedures are prohibitive. We investigate the use of iterated filtering algorithms for this purpose. We introduce a novel algorithm that contains a marginalization step that mitigates issues arising from particle filtering in high dimensions. Our approach enables likelihood-based inference for models that were previously considered intractable, thus broadening the scope of dynamic models available for panel data analysis.

## 153. Extending the Accelerated Failure Conditionals Model to Location-Scale Families

**作者**: Jared N. Lakhani

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17463.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17463.pdf)

**摘要**: Arnold and Arvanitis (2020) introduced a novel class of bivariate conditionally specified distributions, in which dependence between two random variables is established by defining the distribution of one variable conditional on the other. This conditioning regime was formulated through survival functions and termed the accelerated failure conditionals model. Subsequently, Lakhani (2025) extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with non-increasing densities. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal for $X$. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally, the model is applied to a dataset in which the empirical distribution of $Y$ lies on the real line, demonstrating the models' capacity to accommodate $Y$ marginals defined over $\mathbb{R}$.

## 154. Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization

**作者**: Vinay Kanakeri, Shivam Bajaj, Ashwin Verma, Vijay Gupta, Aritra Mitra

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17489.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17489.pdf)

**摘要**: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.

## 155. Optimal Strategy in "Guess Who?": Beyond Binary Search

**作者**: Mihai Nica

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03327.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03327.pdf)

**摘要**: "Guess Who?" is a popular two player game where players ask "Yes"/"No" questions to search for their opponent's secret identity from a pool of possible candidates. This is modeled as a simple stochastic game. Using this model, the optimal strategy is explicitly found. Contrary to popular belief, performing a binary search is \emph{not} always optimal. Instead, the optimal strategy for the player who trails is to make certain bold plays in an attempt catch up. This is discovered by first analyzing a continuous version of the game where players play indefinitely and the winner is never decided after finitely many rounds.

## 156. The positive scalar curvature cobordism category

**作者**: Johannes Ebert, Oscar Randal-Williams

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12951.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12951.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove that many spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics have the homotopy type of infinite loop spaces. Our result in particular applies to the path component of the round metric inside $\mathcal{R}^+ (S^d)$ if $d \geq 6$.
To achieve that goal, we study the cobordism category of manifolds with positive scalar curvature. Under suitable connectivity conditions, we can identify the homotopy fibre of the forgetful map from the psc cobordism category to the ordinary cobordism category with a delooping of spaces of psc metrics. This uses a version of Quillen's Theorem B and instances of the Gromov--Lawson surgery theorem.
We extend some of the surgery arguments by Galatius and the second named author to the psc setting to pass between different connectivity conditions. Segal's theory of $\Gamma$-spaces is then used to construct the claimed infinite loop space structures.
The cobordism category viewpoint also illuminates the action of diffeomorphism groups on spaces of psc metrics. We show that under mild hypotheses on the manifold, the action map from the diffeomorphism group to the homotopy automorphisms of the spaces of psc metrics factors through the Madsen--Tillmann spectrum. This implies a strong rigidity theorem for the action map when the manifold has trivial rational Pontrjagin classes.
A delooped version of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem proved by the first named author is used to moreover show that the secondary index invariant to real $K$-theory is an infinite loop map. These ideas also give a new proof of the main result of our previous work with Botvinnik.

## 157. Convergence of trees with a given degree sequence and of their associated laminations

**作者**: Gabriel Berzunza Ojeda, Cecilia Holmgren, Paul Thévenin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07748.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07748.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we study uniform rooted plane trees with given degree sequence. We show, under some natural hypotheses on the degree sequence, that these trees converge toward the so-called Inhomogeneous Continuum Random Tree after renormalisation. Our proof relies on the convergence of a modification of the well-known Lukasiewicz path. We also give a unified treatment of the limit, as the number of vertices tends to infinity, of the fragmentation process derived by cutting-down the edges of a tree with a given degree sequence, including its geometric representation by a lamination-valued process. The latter is a collection of nested laminations that are compact subsets of the unit disk made of non-crossing chords. In particular, we prove an equivalence between Gromov-weak convergence of discrete trees and the convergence of their associated lamination-valued processes.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10076.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10076.pdf)

**摘要**: Yobuko recently introduced the notion of quasi-$F$-splitting and quasi-$F$-split heights, which generalize and quantify the notion of Frobenius-splitting, and proved that quasi-$F$-split heights coincide with Artin-Mazur heights for Calabi-Yau varieties. In this paper, we prove Fedder type criteria for quasi-$F$-splittings of complete intersections, and in particular, obtain a simple formula to compute Artin-Mazur heights of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. As one of its applications, we prove that there exist Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrarily high Artin-Mazur height over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also give explicit defining equations of quartic K3 surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$ realizing all the possible Artin-Mazur heights.

## 159. On Distributionally Robust Multistage Convex Optimization: Data-driven Models and Performance

**作者**: Shixuan Zhang, Xu Andy Sun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08433.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08433.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a novel algorithmic study with extensive numerical experiments of distributionally robust multistage convex optimization (DR-MCO). Following the previous work on dual dynamic programming (DDP) algorithmic framework for DR-MCO, we focus on data-driven DR-MCO models with Wasserstein ambiguity sets that allow probability measures with infinite supports. These data-driven Wasserstein DR-MCO models have out-of-sample performance guarantees and adjustable in-sample conservatism. Then by exploiting additional concavity or convexity in the uncertain cost functions, we design exact single stage subproblem oracle (SSSO) implementations that ensure the convergence of DDP algorithms. We test the data-driven Wasserstein DR-MCO models against multistage robust convex optimization (MRCO), risk-neutral and risk-averse multistage stochastic convex optimization (MSCO) models on multi-commodity inventory problems and hydro-thermal power planning problems. The results show that our DR-MCO models could outperform MRCO and MSCO models when the data size is small.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06280.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06280.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove the Mixing Conjecture of Michel--Venkatesh for the class group action on Heegner points of large discriminant on compact arithmetic surfaces attached to maximal orders in rational quaternion algebras. The proof is conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and when the division algebra is indefinite we furthermore assume the Ramanujan conjecture. Our methods, which provide an effective rate, are based on the spectral theory of automorphic forms and their $L$-functions, as well as techniques in classical analytic number theory.

## 161. BPS Lie algebras for totally negative 2-Calabi-Yau categories and nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks

**作者**: Ben Davison, Lucien Hennecart, Sebastian Schlegel Mejia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07668.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07668.pdf)

**摘要**: We define and study a sheaf-theoretic cohomological Hall algebra for suitably geometric Abelian categories $\mathcal{A}$ of homological dimension at most two, and a sheaf-theoretic BPS algebra under the conditions that $\mathcal{A}$ is 2-Calabi-Yau and has a good moduli space. We show that the BPS algebra for the preprojective algebra $\Pi_Q$ of a totally negative quiver is the free algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of the closure of the locus parameterising simple $\Pi_Q$-modules in the coarse moduli space.
We define and study the BPS Lie algebra of arbitrary 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{A}$ for which the Euler form is negative on all pairs of non-zero objects, which recovers the BPS algebra as its universal enveloping algebra for such "totally negative" 2CY categories. We show that for totally negative 2CY categories the BPS algebra is freely generated by intersection complexes of certain coarse moduli spaces as above, and the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of objects in such $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a Yangian-type PBW theorem for the BPS Lie algebra. In this way we prove the cohomological integrality theorem for these categories.
We use our results to prove that for $C$ a smooth projective curve, and for $r$ and $d$ not necessarily coprime, there is a nonabelian Hodge isomorphism between the Borel-Moore homologies of the stack of rank $r$ and degree $d$ Higgs bundles, and the appropriate stack of twisted representations of the fundamental group of $C$. In addition we prove the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for totally negative quivers; we prove that their polynomials counting cuspidal functions in the constructible Hall algebra for $Q$ have positive coefficients, strengthening the positivity theorem for the Kac polynomials of such quivers.

## 162. BPS algebras and generalised Kac-Moody algebras from 2-Calabi-Yau categories

**作者**: Ben Davison, Lucien Hennecart, Sebastian Schlegel Mejia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12592.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12592.pdf)

**摘要**: We determine the structure of the BPS algebra of 2-Calabi-Yau Abelian categories for which the stack of objects admits a good moduli space. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of certain connected components (corresponding to roots) of the good moduli space. Some major examples include the BPS algebras of (1) the category of semistable coherent sheaves of given slope on a K3 surface or, more generally, quasiprojective symplectic surface, (2) semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve, (3) preprojective algebras of quivers, (4) multiplicative preprojective algebras and (5) fundamental groups of (quiver) Riemann surfaces. We define the BPS Lie algebras of 2-Calabi-Yau categories and prove that they coincide with the ones obtained by dimensional reduction from the critical cohomological Hall algebra in the case in which the 2-Calabi-Yau category is the category of representations of a preprojective algebra. Consequences include (1) A proof in full generality of the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for absolutely cuspidal polynomials, a strengthening of the Kac positivity conjecture (2) A proof of the cohomological integrality conjecture for the category of semistable coherent sheaves on local K3 surfaces (3) A description of the cohomology (in all degrees) of Nakajima quiver varieties as direct sums of irreducible lowest weight representations over the BPS Lie algebra.

## 163. Near invariance of quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet Hamiltonians

**作者**: Amir Sagiv, Michael I. Weinstein

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10685.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10685.pdf)

**摘要**: The spectral analysis of the unitary monodromy operator, associated with a time-periodically (paramatrically) forced Schrodinger equation, is a question of longstanding interest. Here, we consider this question for Hamiltonians of the form
$$H^{\varepsilon}(t)=H^0 + \varepsilon^a W(\varepsilon^a t, -i\nabla)\, ,$$ where $H^0$ is an unperturbed autonomous Hamiltonian, $a\geq 1$, and $W(T,\cdot)$ has a period of $T_{\rm per} >0$. In particular, in the small $\varepsilon>0$ regime, we seek a comparison between the spectral properties of the monodromy operator, the one-period flow map associated with the $H^\varepsilon(t)$ dynamics, and that of the autonomous (unforced) flow, $\exp[-iH^0 T_{\rm per} \varepsilon ^{-a}]$. We consider $H^0$ which is spatially periodic on $\mathbb{R} ^n$ with respect to a lattice. Using the decomposition of $H^0$ and $H^\varepsilon(t)$ into their actions on spaces (Floquet-Bloch fibers) of pseudo-periodic functions, we establish a near spectral-invariance property for the monodromy operator, when acting data which are $\varepsilon$-localized in energy and quasi-momentum. Our analysis requires the following steps: (i) spectrally-localized data are approximated by {\it band-limited (Floquet-Bloch) wavepackets}; (ii) the envelope dynamics of such wavepackets is well approximated by an effective (homogenized) PDE, and (iii) an exact invariance property for band-limited Floquet-Bloch wavepackets, which follows from the effective dynamics. We apply our general results to a number of periodic Hamiltonians, $H^0$, of interest in the study of photonic and quantum materials.

## 164. Algebraic quantum groups and duality I

**作者**: Alfons Van Daele

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13448.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13448.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $(A,\Delta)$ be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The linear dual $B$ of $A$ is again a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The duality is given by an element $V\in B\otimes A$, defined by $\langle V,a\otimes b\rangle=\langle a,b\rangle$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. We use $\langle\,\cdot\, , \,\cdot\,\rangle$ for the pairings. In the introduction of this paper, we recall the various properties of this element $V$ as sitting in the algebra $B\otimes A$. More generally, we can consider an algebraic quantum group $(A,\Delta)$. We use the term here for a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with integrals. For $B$ we now take the dual $\widehat A$ of $A$. It is again an algebraic quantum group. In this case, the duality gives rise to an element $V$ in the multiplier algebra $M(B\otimes A)$. Still, most of the properties of $V$ in the finite-dimensional case are true in this more general setting. The focus in this paper lies on various aspects of the duality between $A$ and its dual $\widehat A$. Among other things we include a number of formulas relating the objects associated with an algebraic quantum group and its dual. This note is meant to give a comprehensive, yet concise (and sometimes simpler) account of these known results. This is part I of a series of three papers on this subject. The case of a multiplier Hopf $^*$-algebra with positive integrals is treated in detail in part II and part III.

## 165. Restrictions of Békollé--Bonami weights and Bloch functions

**作者**: Alberto Dayan, Adrián Llinares, Karl-Mikael Perfekt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04859.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04859.pdf)

**摘要**: We characterize the restrictions of Békollé--Bonami weights of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, to subsets of the unit disc, thus proving an analogue of Wolff's restriction theorem for Muckenhoupt weights. Sundberg proved a discrete version of Wolff's original theorem, by characterizing the trace of $BMO$-functions onto interpolating sequences. We consider an analogous question in our setting, by studying the trace of Bloch functions. Through Makarov's probabilistic approach to the Bloch space, our question can be recast as a restriction problem for dyadic martingales with uniformly bounded increments.

## 166. Unramified Grothendieck-Serre for isotropic groups

**作者**: Kestutis Cesnavicius, Roman Fedorov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08660.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08660.pdf)

**摘要**: The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.

## 167. Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo

**作者**: Amedeo Roberto Esposito, Marco Mondelli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11200.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11200.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods.
Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. The technical tools introduced lend themselves to providing novel bounds on the contraction coefficient (SDPI constant) of information-theoretic divergences. We thus provide a variety of examples in which we show an improvement over the state of the art. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.

## 168. The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: continuum version of the scale-by-scale homogenization result

**作者**: Peter Morfe, Felix Otto, Christian Wagner

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00709.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00709.pdf)

**摘要**: This note is about a drift-diffusion process $X$ with a time-independent, divergence-free drift $b$, where $b$ is a smooth Gaussian field that decorrelates over large scales. In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated.
In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple Itô SDE with $\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by Itô calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver.

**摘要**: We determine the maximal dimension of compact subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$, the moduli space of complex principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$, and the maximal dimension of a compact subvariety through a very general point of $\mathcal{A}_g$. This also allows us to draw some conclusions for compact subvarieties of the moduli space of complex curves of compact type.

## 170. Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}{p_2}}$

**作者**: Biplab Chatterjee, Ratnesh Kumar Mishra

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09561.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09561.pdf)

**摘要**: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.

## 171. Consensus-based algorithms for stochastic optimization problems

**作者**: Sabrina Bonandin, Michael Herty

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10372.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10372.pdf)

**摘要**: We address an optimization problem where the cost function is the expectation of a random mapping. To tackle the problem two approaches based on the approximation of the objective function by consensus-based particle optimization methods on the search space are developed. The resulting methods are mathematically analyzed using a mean-field approximation and their connection is established. Several numerical experiments show the validity of the proposed algorithms and investigate their rates of convergence.

## 172. Complexity and algorithms for Arc-Kayles and Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles

**作者**: Kyle Burke, Antoine Dailly, Nacim Oijid

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10390.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10390.pdf)

**摘要**: Arc-Kayles is a game where two players alternate removing two adjacent vertices until no move is left, the winner being the player who played the last move. Introduced in 1978, its computational complexity is still open. More recently, subtraction games, where the players cannot disconnect the graph while removing vertices, were introduced. In particular, Arc-Kayles admits a non-disconnecting variant that is a subtraction game. We study the computational complexity of subtraction games on graphs, proving that they are PSPACE-complete even on very structured graph classes (split, bipartite of any even girth). We give a quadratic kernel for Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles when parameterized by the feedback edge number, as well as polynomial-time algorithms for clique trees and a subclass of threshold graphs. We also show that a sufficient condition for a second player-win on Arc-Kayles is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.

## 173. Explicit Computation of The Generic Component of the Analytic Moduli of a Plane Branch

**作者**: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso, Javier Ribón

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09684.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09684.pdf)

**摘要**: Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a fixed equisingularity class of irreducible germs of complex analytic plane curves. We compute a basis of the ${\mathbb C}[[x]]$-module of Kähler differentials for generic $\Gamma \in {\mathcal C}$, algorithmically, and study its behaviour under blow-up.
As a first application, we give an algorithm providing the generic semimodule in an equisingularity class in terms of its multiplicity and its Puiseux characteristic exponents. As another application, we give an alternative proof for a formula of Genzmer, that provides the dimension of the moduli of analytic classes in the equisingularity class of $\Gamma$.

## 174. Uniform Value and Decidability in Ergodic Blind Stochastic Games

**作者**: Krishnendu Chatterjee, David Lurie, Raimundo Saona, Bruno Ziliotto

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12583.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12583.pdf)

**摘要**: We study a class of two-player zero-sum stochastic games known as \textit{blind stochastic games}, where players neither observe the state nor receive any information about it during the game. A central concept for analyzing long-duration stochastic games is the \textit{uniform value}. A game has a uniform value $v$ if for every $\varepsilon>0$, Player 1 (resp., Player 2) has a strategy such that, for all sufficiently large $n$, his average payoff over $n$ stages is at least $v-\varepsilon$ (resp., at most $v+\varepsilon$). Prior work has shown that the uniform value may not exist in general blind stochastic games. To address this, we introduce a subclass called \textit{ergodic blind stochastic games}, defined by imposing an ergodicity condition on the state transitions. For this subclass, we prove the existence of the uniform value and provide an algorithm to approximate it, establishing the \textit{decidability} of the approximation problem. Notably, this decidability result is novel even in the single-player setting of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Furthermore, we show that no algorithm can compute the uniform value exactly, emphasizing the tightness of our result. Finally, we establish that the uniform value is independent of the initial belief.

**摘要**: We present a counterexample to Viterbo's volume-capacity conjecture. This implies, in particular, that in contrast with a well-known conjecture, symplectic capacities do not coincide on the class of convex domains in the classical phase space.

**作者**: Aleksei Gorshkov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19488.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19488.pdf)

**摘要**: In the paper we study the 2D div-curl problem in the exterior domain which models the flow with given vorticity, divergency, boundary condition at infinity, and Dirichlet condition on the solid surface. We will find the relations on vorticity and divergence for uniqueness solvability of the problem and deduce the explicit formula.

## 177. A Low Rank Neural Representation of Entropy Solutions

**作者**: Donsub Rim, Gerrit Welper

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05694.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05694.pdf)

**摘要**: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.

## 179. Universal subgradient and proximal bundle methods for convex and strongly convex hybrid composite optimization

**作者**: Vincent Guigues, Jiaming Liang, Renato D.C. Monteiro

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10073.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10073.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper develops two parameter-free methods for solving convex and strongly convex hybrid composite optimization problems, namely, a composite subgradient type method and a proximal bundle type method. Functional complexity bounds for the two methods are established in terms of the unknown strong convexity parameter. The two proposed methods are universal with respect to all problem parameters, including the strong convexity one, and require no knowledge of the optimal value. Moreover, in contrast to previous works, they do not restart nor use multiple threads.

## 180. Fusion and specialization for type ADE shuffle algebras

**作者**: Andrei Neguţ, Alexander Tsymbaliuk

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02411.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02411.pdf)

**摘要**: Root vectors in quantum groups (of finite type) generalize to fused currents in quantum loop groups ([5]). In the present paper, we construct fused currents as duals to specialization maps of the corresponding shuffle algebras ([7,8,9]) in types ADE. Both root vectors and fused currents depend on a convex order of the positive roots, and the choice we make in the present paper is that of the Auslander-Reiten order ([24]) corresponding to an orientation of the type ADE Dynkin diagram.

## 181. A degree-biased cutting process for random recursive trees

**作者**: Laura Eslava, Sergio I. López, Marco L. Ortiz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05168.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05168.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate a degree-biased cutting process on random recursive trees, where each vertex is deleted with probability proportional to its degree. We establish the splitting property and derive the explicit distribution of the number of vertices deleted in each cut. This leads to a recursive formula for Kn, the number of cuts needed to erase a random recursive tree with n vertices. Furthermore, we show that Kn is stochastically dominated by Jn, the number of jumps made by a related walk with a barrier. We prove that Jn converges in distribution to a random variable with a spectrally negative stable distribution. Finally, we examine connections between this cutting procedure and a coalescing process on the set of n elements.

## 182. Superabelian logics

**作者**: Petr Cintula, Filip Jankovec, Carles Noguera

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20170.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20170.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a unified algebraic study of a family of logics related to Abelian logic (Ab), the logic of Abelian lattice-ordered groups. We treat $\Ab$ as the base system and refer to its expansions as \emph {superabelian logics}. The paper focuses on two main families of expansions. First, we investigate the rich landscape of infinitary extensions of Ab, providing an axiomatization for the infinitary logic of real numbers and showing that there exist $2^{2^\omega}$ distinct logics in this family. Second, we introduce \emph{pointed Abelian logic} (pAb), the logic of pointed Abelian lattice-ordered groups, by adding a new constant to the language. This framework includes \emph{Łukasiewicz unbound logic}. We provide axiomatizations for its finitary and infinitary versions as extensions of pAb and establish their precise relationship with standard Łukasiewicz logic via a formal translation. Finally, the methods developed for this analysis are generalized to axiomatize the logics of other prominent pointed groups.

## 183. Skew-Brauer graph algebras

**作者**: Ana García Elsener, Victoria Guazzelli, Yadira Valdivieso

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01942.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01942.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we introduce a new class of algebras called skew-Brauer graph algebras, which generalize the well-known Brauer graph algebras. We establish that skew-Brauer graph algebras are symmetric and can be defined using a Brauer graph with additional information. We show that the class of trivial extensions of skew-gentle algebras coincides with a subclass of skew-Brauer graph algebras, where the associated skew-Brauer graph has multiplicity function identically equal to one, generalizing a result over gentle algebras. We also characterize skew-Brauer algebras of finite representation type. Finally, we provide a geometric interpretation of cut-sets and reflections of algebras using orbifold dissections.

## 184. A Critical Drift-Diffusion Equation: Connections to the Diffusion on $\textbf{SL}(2)$

**作者**: Peter Morfe, Felix Otto, Christian Wagner

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15983.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15983.pdf)

**摘要**: In this note, we connect two seemingly unrelated objects: On the one hand is a two-dimensional drift-diffusion process $X$ with divergence-free and time-independent drift $b$. The drift is given by a stationary Gaussian ensemble, and we focus on the critical case where a small-scale cut-off is necessary for well-posedness and the large-scale cancellations lead to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. On the other hand is the natural diffusion $F$ on the Lie group $\textbf{SL}(2)$ of matrices of determinant one. As a consequence of this connection, the strongly non-Gaussian character of $F$ transmits to how $X$ depends on its starting point.

## 185. Independent Domination of k-Trees

**作者**: Andrew Pham

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07411.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07411.pdf)

**摘要**: Given a simple, finite, nonempty graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$, a vertex subset $D\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a dominating set if every vertex $v\in V(G)-D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The independent domination number $\gamma_i(G)$ is the minimum cardinality among all independent dominating sets of $G$. Since determining the domination number for general graphs is NP-complete, we focus on the class of $k$-trees. Favaron established a tight upper bound for $1$-trees, while Campos and Wakabayashi determined a tight upper bound for maximal outerplanar graphs, a subclass of $2$-trees. We generalize these results and establish a tight upper bound for the independent domination number of $k$-trees for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.

## 186. Noether-Lefschetz cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties

**作者**: Aitor Iribar Lopez

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09910.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09910.pdf)

**摘要**: The locus of non-simple abelian varieties in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties gives rise to Noether-Lefschetz cycles. We study their intersection theoretic properties using the tautological projection constructed in [CMOP24], and show that projection defines a homomorphism when restricted to cycles supported on that locus. Using Hecke correspondences and the pullback by Torelli we prove that $[\mathcal {A}_1 \times \mathcal A_{g-1}]$ is not tautological in the sense of [vdG99] for $g=12$ and $g\geq 16$ even. We also explore the connections between Noether-Lefschetz cycles and the Gromov-Witten theory of a moving elliptic curve.

## 187. Lifting polynomial representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ from $\mathbb{F}_p$ to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$

**作者**: Chris Parker, Martin van Beek

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16379.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16379.pdf)

**摘要**: We describe all of the irreducible polynomial $\mathbb{F}_p\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations which lift to $(\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z})\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations for $s>1$, observing that they almost never do. We also show that two related indecomposable $\mathbb{F}_p \mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations cannot be lifted to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$ representations for $s>1$.

## 188. Can one hear the shape of a random walk?

**作者**: Michael J. Larsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19762.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19762.pdf)

**摘要**: To what extent is the underlying distribution of a finitely supported unbiased random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ determined by the sequence of times at which the walk returns to the origin? The main result of this paper is that, in various senses, most unbiased random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ are determined up to equivalence by the sequence $I_1,I_2,I_3,\ldots$, where $I_n$ denotes the probability of being at the origin after $n$ steps. We also give an application to an inverse problem from asymptotic representation theory. The proof uses Laplace's method and a delicate Galois-theoretic analysis which ultimately depends on the classification of finite simple groups.

**作者**: Miguel Rodríguez-Olmos

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07153.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07153.pdf)

**摘要**: Dirichlet's problem for the dynamics of fluid bodies with ellipsoidal shape can be formulated as a Hamiltonian system invariant under the action of a symmetry Lie group. I apply methods from Hamiltonian bifurcation theory to the study of the branch of solutions known as MacLaurin spheroids. I show that all its bifurcations are into three types named I, $S$ and adjoint $S$ ellipsoids in agreement with previous necessary conditions obtained by Chandrasekhar by linearizing the hydrodynamic equations.

## 191. Pair Correlation of Zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function I: Proportions of Simple Zeros and Critical Zeros

**作者**: Siegfred Alan C. Baluyot, Daniel Alan Goldston, Ade Irma Suriajaya, Caroline L. Turnage-Butterbaugh

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14545.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14545.pdf)

**摘要**: Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery proved a theorem in 1973 concerning the pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and applied this to prove that at least $2/3$ of the zeros are simple. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of the pair correlation method and show, for the first time, that it can be used to prove results on the \emph{horizontal distribution} of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.
In earlier work we showed how to remove RH from Montgomery's theorem and, in turn, obtain results on simple zeros assuming conditions on the zeros that are weaker than RH. Here we assume a more general condition, namely that all the zeros $\rho = \beta +i\gamma$ with $T<\gamma\le 2T$ are in a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line with width $b/\log T$, where $b\to 0$ as $T\to \infty$. We first prove the generalization of Montgomery's result that at least $2/3$ of zeros are simple, and we then prove the new result that the pair correlation method yields at least $2/3$ of the zeros on the critical line. We also use the pair correlation method to prove that at least $1/3$ of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line, a result already known unconditionally using different methods.

## 192. Monotonicity of the ultrafilter number function

**作者**: Toshimichi Usuba

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14988.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14988.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate whether the ultrafilter number function $\kappa \mapsto \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ on the cardinals is monotone, that is, whether $\mathfrak{u}(\lambda) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ holds for all cardinals $\lambda < \kappa$ or not. We show that monotonicity can fail, but the failure has large cardinal strength. On the other hand, we prove that there are many restrictions of the failure of monotonicity. For instance, if $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal with countable cofinality or a strong limit singular cardinal, then $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa) \le \mathfrak{u}(\kappa^+)$ holds.

## 193. Intermediate dimensions of measures: Interpolating between Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions

**作者**: Nicolas E. Angelini, Ursula M. Molter, Jose M. Tejada

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00772.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00772.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we define a family of dimensions for Borel measures that lie between the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions for measures, analogous to the intermediate dimensions of sets. Previously, Hare et. al. in [11] defined families of dimensions that interpolate between the Minkowski and Assouad dimensions for measures. Additionally, Fraser, in [8] introduced an additional family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions of measures. Our results address a "gap" in the study of dimension interpolation for measures, almost completing the spectrum of intermediate dimensions for measures: from Fourier to Assouad dimensions.
Furthermore, Theorem 3.13 can be interpreted as a "reverse Frostman" lemma for intermediate dimensions. We also obtain a capacity-theoretic definition that enables us to estimate the intermediate dimensions of pushforward measures by projections.

## 194. Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in QFT

**作者**: Christophe Garban, Antti Kupiainen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02554.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02554.pdf)

**摘要**: The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:
(1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $\beta$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit of $2d$ Ising. (N.B. In the $h$-direction it is not locally singular).
(2) The $2d$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular w.r.t the $2d$ hierarchical Gaussian Free Field for all $\beta\in[\beta_{L^2}, \beta_{BKT})$.
(3) The Hierarchical $\Phi^4_3$ field is singular w.r.t the $3d$ hierarchical GFF.
Item (1) gives the first strong indication that the energy field of critical $2d$ Ising model does not exist as a random Schwarz distribution on the plane. Item (2) has been proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $2d$ Sine-Gordon sufficiently far from the BKT point in [GM24] while item (3) is proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $3d$ $\Phi^4_3$ field in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].
We believe our way to detect a singular behaviour at all scales is very much down to earth and may be applicable in all settings where one has a good enough control on the so-called effective potentials.

## 195. Stochastic neutral fractions and the effective population size

**作者**: Raphaël Forien, Emmanuel Schertzer, Zsófia Talyigás, Julie Tourniaire

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05062.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05062.pdf)

**摘要**: The dynamics of a general structured population is modelled using a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an infinite decomposability property. This property allows the population to be divided into an arbitrary number of allelic components, also known as stochastic neutral fractions. When demographic noise is small, a fast-slow principle provides a general formula for the effective population size in structured populations. To illustrate this approach, we revisit several examples from the literature, including expansion fronts.

## 196. A positivity conjecture for a quotient of $q$-binomial coefficients

**作者**: Mona Gatzweiler, Christian Krattenthaler

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06032.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06032.pdf)

**摘要**: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. Moreover, we move ahead to extend our conjecture to D. Stanton's fake Gaussian sequences. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10227.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10227.pdf)

**摘要**: For a graph $G$, let $im(G)$ denote the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as an immersion. A recent paper of Collins, Heenehan, and McDonald (2023) studied the behaviour of this parameter under graph products, asking how large can $im(G\ast H)$ be in terms of $im(G)$ and $im(H)$, when $\ast$ is one of the four standard graph products. We consider a similar question for the parameter $toi(G)$ which denotes the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as a totally odd immersion. As an application, we obtain that no minimum counterexample to the immersion-analogue of the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture can be obtained from the Cartesian, direct (tensor), lexicographic or strong product of graphs.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15628.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15628.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider infinite-dimensional random diffusion dynamics for the Asakura--Oosawa model of interacting hard spheres of two different sizes. We construct a solution to the corresponding SDE with collision local times, analyse its reversible measures, and observe the emergence of an attractive short-range depletion interaction between the large spheres. We study the Gibbs measures associated to this new interaction, exploring connections to percolation and optimal packing.

## 199. Asymptotic evaluation of the information processing capacity in reservoir computing

**作者**: Yohei Saito

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15769.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15769.pdf)

**摘要**: Reservoir computing (RC) is becoming increasingly important because of its short training time. The squared error normalized by the target output is called the information processing capacity (IPC) and is used to evaluate the performance of an RC system. Since RC aims to learn the relationship between input and output time series, we should evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data rather than the IPC for finite-length data. However, a method for estimating it has not been established. We evaluated the IPC for infinitely long data using the asymptotic expansion of the IPC and weighted least-squares fitting. Then, we showed the validity of our method by numerical simulations. This work makes the performance evaluation of RC more evident.

## 200. Hierarchical Gradient Coding: From Optimal Design to Privacy at Intermediate Nodes

**作者**: Ali Gholami, Tayyebeh Jahani-Nezhad, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18251.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18251.pdf)

**摘要**: Gradient coding is a distributed computing technique for computing gradient vectors over large datasets by outsourcing partial computations to multiple workers, typically connected directly to the server. In this work, we investigate gradient coding in a hierarchical setting, where intermediate nodes sit between the server and workers. This structure reduces the communication load received at the server, which is a bottleneck in conventional gradient coding systems. In this paper, the intermediate nodes, referred to as \textit{relays}, process the data received from workers and send the results to the server for the final gradient computation. Our main contribution is deriving the optimal communication-computation trade-off by designing a linear coding scheme, also considering straggling and adversarial nodes among both relays and workers. We propose a coding scheme which achieves both the optimal relay-to-server communication load and the optimal worker-to-relay communication load. We further extend our setting to incorporate privacy by requiring that relays learn no information about the computed partial gradients from the messages they receive. This is achieved by introducing shared randomness among workers, allowing each worker to encode its partial gradients such that the randomness cannot be canceled out at the relay. Meanwhile, the server can successfully decode the global gradient by eliminating this randomness after receiving the computations of the non-straggling relays. Importantly, this privacy guarantee is achieved without increasing the overall communication load.

## 201. Bounding minimal log discrepancies of general arrangement varieties

**作者**: Leandro Meier

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02681.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02681.pdf)

**摘要**: The minimal log discrepancy is an invariant of singularities that plays an important role in the birational classification of algebraic varieties. Shokurov conjectured that the minimal log discrepancy can always be bounded from above in terms of the dimension of the variety. We prove this conjecture for general arrangement varieties, a particular class of T-varieties, adding to previous results on this conjecture which include threefolds, toric varieties, and local complete intersection varieties.

**作者**: Christopher J. Fewster

**摘要**: Hadamard states were originally introduced for quantised Klein-Gordon fields and occupy a central position in the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes. Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories, such as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of each require slightly different treatments.
The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard states for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of theories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable' Pauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are not necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces to previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We develop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition propagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and suitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert space valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point functions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For locally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space. It is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or reduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a particular application it is shown that state updates resulting from nonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.
The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro and Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field. Among our other applications, we revisit the neutral Proca field and prove a complete equivalence between the MMV definition of Hadamard states and an older work of Fewster and Pfenning.

## 203. On the Equivalence of Synchronization Definitions in the Kuramoto Flow: A Unified Approach

**作者**: Ting-Yang Hsiao, Yun-Feng Lo, Chengbin Zhu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19781.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19781.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a rigorous mathematical framework establishing the equivalence of four classical notions of synchronization full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order parameter synchronization in generalized Kuramoto models, via a non-perturbative, finite-dimensional analysis. Our approach avoids linearization, mean-field limits, and restrictions on initial conditions, relying instead on global phase-space geometry, periodic vector field structure, and compactness arguments based on contradiction. These results clarify the foundational role of the order parameter and provide a unified understanding of synchronization across a broad class of heterogeneous oscillator networks.

## 204. Power-free palindromes and reversed primes

**作者**: Shashi Chourasiya, Daniel R. Johnston

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21136.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21136.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove new results related to the digital reverse $\overleftarrow{n}$ of a positive integer $n$ in a fixed base $b$. First we show that for $b\geq 26000$, there exists infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\overleftarrow{p}$ is square-free. Further, we show that for $b\geq 2$ there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are cube-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.

## 205. Conditional Extreme Value Estimation for Dependent Time Series

**作者**: Martin Bladt, Laurits Glargaard, Theodor Henningsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22366.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22366.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the consistency and weak convergence of the conditional tail function and conditional Hill estimators under broad dependence assumptions for a heavy-tailed response sequence and a covariate sequence. Consistency is established under $\alpha$-mixing, while asymptotic normality follows from $\beta$-mixing and second-order conditions. A key aspect of our approach is its versatile functional formulation in terms of the conditional tail process. Simulations demonstrate its performance across dependence scenarios. We apply our method to extreme event modelling in the oil industry, revealing distinct tail behaviours under varying conditioning values.

## 206. Spectral enclosure estimates for non-self-adjoint Dirac operators

**作者**: Jeffrey Oregero

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02236.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02236.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the spectrum of a periodic non-self-adjoint Dirac operator, and its dependence on a semiclassical parameter is also considered. Several bounds on the spectrum are obtained which provide sharp spectral enclosure estimates. Importantly, a sufficient condition is obtained which ensures semiclassical spectral confinement to the real axis and a bounded subset of the imaginary axis of the spectral plane.

## 207. Covering spiky annuli by planks

**作者**: Gergely Ambrus, Julian Huddell, Maggie Lai, Matthew Quirk, Elias Williams

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02656.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02656.pdf)

**摘要**: Answering Tarski's plank problem, Bang showed in 1951 that it is impossible to cover a convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 1$ by planks whose total width is less than the minimal width $w(K)$ of $K$. In 2003, A. Bezdek asked whether the same statement holds if one is required to cover only the annulus obtained from $K$ by removing a homothetic copy contained within. He showed that if $K$ is the unit square, then saving width in a plank covering is not possible, provided that the homothety factor is sufficiently small. White and Wisewell in 2006 characterized polygons that possess this property. We generalize the constructive part of their classification to spiky convex bodies: a body $K$ is spiky at a boundary point $x$ with supporting hyperplane $H$ and corresponding outer normal $u$, if both $K$ and its tangent cone at $x$ intersect $H$ only at $x$. We show that if $K$ is a convex disc or a convex body in 3-space that is spiky in a minimal width direction, then for every $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ it is possible to cut a homothetic copy $\varepsilon K$ from the interior of $K$ so that the remaining annulus can be covered by planks whose total width is strictly less than $w(K)$.

## 208. Emergence of microbial host dormancy during a persistent virus epidemic

**作者**: Jochen Blath, András Tóbiás

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04943.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04943.pdf)

**摘要**: We study a minimal stochastic individual-based model for a microbial population challenged by a persistent (lytic) virus epidemic. We focus on the situation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus population are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant'' host individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a reversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding infection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy trait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We prove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can nevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability (bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced reproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of either the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the parameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is possible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical amount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic population size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the population after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic arguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both host types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the resident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.

## 209. A poset game on submonoids of additively indecomposable ordinals

**作者**: Fabián Rivero Herrera

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07317.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07317.pdf)

**摘要**: Inspired by García-Marco and Knauer arXiv:1705.11034, we consider the Chomp game on a natural well-partial order structure defined on submonoids $\mathcal{S}^\sigma\subseteq\omega^\sigma$ of additively indecomposable ordinals generated by sets of ordinals under natural sum and product of ordinals. We have called the generatinng sets of ordinals for which the game terminates in a finite number of steps well-partial order generators, and, under very mild conditions, we have characterized those that are finite.
A fundamental observation is that, for every ordinal $\sigma$, there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that, for any class $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\tau;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\tau}) \mid \tau\geq\sigma\}$ of well-partial orders generated by a subset of $\omega^\sigma$, the second player has a winning strategy on all those posets or only on $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\beta;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\beta}) \mid\beta\in\alpha\}$ for some successor ordinal $\alpha\leq\xi$ (and the first player will have a winning strategy on the rest of the posets). This Hanf number-style property could be valuable in proving the existence of winning strategies. We conjecture that $ \xi $ is the smallest possible and, using results from arXiv:1908.09664, we prove that, if we restrict ourselves to the classes generated by finite sets of ordinals, $\xi<|\omega^\sigma|^+$. We also explicitly describe a winning strategy for a specific family of classes.

## 210. Toda-Type Presentations for the Quantum K Theory of Partial Flag Varieties

**作者**: Kamyar Amini, Irit Huq-Kuruvilla, Leonardo C. Mihalcea, Daniel Orr, Weihong Xu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07412.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07412.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety ${\rm Fl}(n)$, via Kato's ${\rm K}_T({\rm pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$ to that of ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for ${\rm Fl}(n)$, we show that the same pushforward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the ${\rm K}$-theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.

## 211. Sionna RT: Technical Report

**作者**: Fayçal Aït Aoudia, Jakob Hoydis, Merlin Nimier-David, Baptiste Nicolet, Sebastian Cammerer, Alexander Keller

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21719.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21719.pdf)

**摘要**: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer, Sionna RT, for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.

## 212. On the Schrödingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries

**作者**: Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yizhe Peng, Yue Yu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00370.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00370.pdf)

**摘要**: The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.

**摘要**: This paper investigates a nonlinear logistic model for age-structured population dynamics. The model incorporates interdependent fertility and mortality functions within a logistic framework, offering insights into stationary solutions and asymptotic behavior.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01240.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01240.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove an explicit local linear rate for ADMM solving the isotropic Total Variation (TV) norm compressed sensing problem in multiple dimensions, by analyzing the auxiliary variable in the equivalent Douglas-Rachford splitting on a dual problem. Numerical verification on large 3D problems and real MRI data will be shown. Though the proven rate is not sharp, it is close to the observed ones in numerical tests.

## 215. Some developments of exchangeable measure-valued Pólya sequences

**作者**: Yoana R. Chorbadzhiyska, Hristo Sariev, Mladen Savov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01594.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01594.pdf)

**摘要**: Measure-valued Pólya sequences (MVPS) are processes whose dynamics are governed by generalized Pólya urn schemes with infinitely many colors. Assuming a general reinforcement rule, exchangeable MVPSs can be viewed as extensions of Blackwell and MacQueen's Pólya sequence, which characterizes an exchangeable sequence whose directing random measure has a Dirichlet process prior distribution. Here, we show that the prior distribution of any exchangeable MVPS is a Dirichlet process mixture with respect to a latent parameter that is associated with the atoms of an emergent conditioning $\sigma$-algebra. As the mixing components have disjoint supports, the directing random measure can be interpreted as a random histogram with bins randomly located on these same atoms. Furthermore, we extend the basic exchangeable MVPS to include a null component in the reinforcement, which corresponds to the presence of a fixed component in the directing random measure. Finally, we examine the effects of relaxing exchangeability to conditional identity in distribution (c.i.d.) and find out that the two are equivalent for balanced MVPSs. The paper features a complementary study of some properties of probability kernels that underlies the analysis of exchangeable and c.i.d. MVPSs.

## 216. Factorizations for variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights

**作者**: Stefanos Lappas, Tuomas Oikari

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23300.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23300.pdf)

**摘要**: Given two variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights $w\in A_{p(\cdot)}$ and $w_1\in A_{p_1(\cdot)}$, we prove that for all small enough $\theta>0,$ there holds that $w_0\in A_{p_0(\cdot)},$ where the weight is determined by $w = w_0^{1-\theta}w_1^{\theta}$ and exponent of the weight class by $1/p(\cdot) = (1-\theta)/p_0(\cdot) + \theta/p_1(\cdot).$ The proof is based on a recent reverse Hölder's inequality for variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights by Cruz-Uribe and Penrod. We upgrade these factorizations to the restricted range context by using a recent transformation formula due to Nieraeth. Then, following an extrapolation of compactness scheme by Hytönen and Lappas, we provide an alternative proof of the recent extrapolation of compactness results of Lorist and Nieraeth in the context of weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces.

## 217. Vertex-transitive nut graph order-degree existence problem

**作者**: Ivan Damnjanović

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02481.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02481.pdf)

**摘要**: A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$. As a direct consequence, we obtain all the pairs $(n, d)$ for which there is a $d$-regular vertex-transitive (resp. Cayley) nut graph of order $n$.

## 218. The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts

**作者**: Sean Cox

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04155.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04155.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class of monomorphisms in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of the class.

## 219. Longest increasing subsequences for distributions with atoms, and an inhomogeneous Hammersley process

**作者**: Anne-Laure Basdevant, Lucas Gerin, Maxime Marivain

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05775.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05775.pdf)

**摘要**: A famous result by Hammersley and Versik-Kerov states that the length $L_n$ of the longest increasing subsequence among $n$ iid continuous random variables grows like $2\sqrt{n}$. We investigate here the asymptotic behavior of $L_n$ for distributions with atoms. For purely discrete random variables, we characterize the asymptotic order of $L_n$ through a variational problem and provide explicit estimates for classical distributions. The proofs rely on a coupling with an inhomogeneous version of the discrete-time continuous-space Hammersley process. This reveals that, in contrast to the continuous case, the discrete setting exhibits a wide range of growth rates between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $o(\sqrt{n})$, depending on the tail behavior of the distribution. We can then easily deduce the asymptotics of $L_n$ for a completely arbitrary distribution.

## 220. Efficient Stochastic BFGS methods Inspired by Bayesian Principles

**作者**: André Carlon, Luis Espath, Raúl Tempone

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07729.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07729.pdf)

**摘要**: Quasi-Newton methods are ubiquitous in deterministic local search due to their efficiency and low computational cost. This class of methods uses the history of gradient evaluations to approximate second-order derivatives. However, only noisy gradient observations are accessible in stochastic optimization; thus, deriving quasi-Newton methods in this setting is challenging. Although most existing quasi-Newton methods for stochastic optimization rely on deterministic equations that are modified to circumvent noise, we propose a new approach inspired by Bayesian inference to assimilate noisy gradient information and derive the stochastic counterparts to standard quasi-Newton methods. We focus on the derivations of stochastic BFGS and L-BFGS, but our methodology can also be employed to derive stochastic analogs of other quasi-Newton methods. The resulting stochastic BFGS (S-BFGS) and stochastic L-BFGS (L-S-BFGS) can effectively learn an inverse Hessian approximation even with small batch sizes. For a problem of dimension $d$, the iteration cost of S-BFGS is $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$, and the cost of L-S-BFGS is $\mathcal{O}(d)$. Numerical experiments with a dimensionality of up to $30,720$ demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.

## 221. Manifolds with kinks and the asymptotic behavior of the graph Laplacian operator with Gaussian kernel

**作者**: Susovan Pal, David Tewodrose

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07751.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07751.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce manifolds with kinks, a class of manifolds with possibly singular boundary that notably contains manifolds with smooth boundary and corners. We derive the asymptotic behavior of the Graph Laplace operator with Gaussian kernel and its deterministic limit on these spaces as bandwidth goes to zero. We show that this asymptotic behavior is determined by the inward sector of the tangent space and, as special cases, we derive its behavior near interior and singular points. Lastly, we show the validity of our theoretical results using numerical simulation.

## 222. Dynamic access pricing control for fair and stable resource sharing

**作者**: Christopher King, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam, Christos G. Cassandras, Fabian R. Wirth, Robert N. Shorten

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17939.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17939.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the use of pricing as a regulatory mechanism when an unknown number of autonomous agents compete for access to a shared resource (possibly limited in volume or capacity). In standard dynamic pricing control systems, an increasing price is used to balance supply and demand for a resource in a constrained environment. A major drawback of dynamic pricing is that it is socially regressive, i.e., unfair, as such systems favour price-insensitive (unresponsive) traffic and control the demand at the expense of price-sensitive (responsive) traffic. We tackle this fundamental issue by proposing a new form of pricing that strikes a balance between using price as a control mechanism to manage demand for a resource and ensuring fair access to the resource for both price-sensitive and insensitive traffic. Our system gives rise to a switched non-linear ODE model, the stability of which is equivalent to ensuring the fairness properties of the pricing control system. Simulations illustrate this stability-fairness tradeoff and with the results demonstrating the effectiveness of the overall design.

## 223. Implementation of Worsey-Farin splines with applications to solution transfer

**作者**: Logan Larose, David Williams

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01193.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01193.pdf)

**摘要**: This work primarily focuses on providing full implementation details for Worsey-Farin (WF) spline interpolation over tetrahedral elements. While this spline space is not new and the theory has been covered in other works, there is a lack of explicit and comprehensive implementation details, which we hope to provide. In this paper, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the WF-spline space through a simple target application: solution transfer. Moreover, we derive an error estimate for the WF spline-based, solution transfer process. We conduct numerical experiments quantifying the conservative nature and order of accuracy of the transfer process, and we present a qualitative evaluation of the visualization properties of the smoothed solution. Additionally, in our study of conservation, we demonstrate how adaptive numerical quadrature rules on the tetrahedron used in conjunction with global L2-projection can improve the conservation of the solution transfer process.

## 224. Online selective conformal inference: adaptive scores, convergence rate and optimality

**作者**: Pierre Humbert, Ulysse Gazin, Ruth Heller, Etienne Roquain

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10336.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10336.pdf)

**摘要**: In a supervised online setting, quantifying uncertainty has been proposed in the seminal work of \cite{gibbs2021adaptive}. For any given point-prediction algorithm, their method (ACI) produces a conformal prediction set with an average missed coverage getting close to a pre-specified level $\alpha$ for a long time horizon. We introduce an extended version of this algorithm, called OnlineSCI, allowing the user to additionally select times where such an inference should be made. OnlineSCI encompasses several prominent online selective tasks, such as building prediction intervals for extreme outcomes, classification with abstention, and online testing. While OnlineSCI controls the average missed coverage on the selected in an adversarial setting, our theoretical results also show that it controls the instantaneous error rate (IER) at the selected times, up to a non-asymptotical remainder term. Importantly, our theory covers the case where OnlineSCI updates the point-prediction algorithm at each time step, a property which we refer to as {\it adaptive} capability. We show that the adaptive versions of OnlineSCI can convergence to an optimal solution and provide an explicit convergence rate in each of the aforementioned application cases, under specific mild conditions. Finally, the favorable behavior of OnlineSCI in practice is illustrated by numerical experiments.

## 225. Reduced basis solvers for unfitted methods on parameterized domains

**作者**: Nicholas Mueller, Santiago Badia, Yiran Zhao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15320.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15320.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced basis approximations of parametrized partial differential equations defined on parameter-dependent domains. Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16427.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16427.pdf)

**摘要**: The notions of idempotental identities and axial identities of axial algebras are introduced, in order to understand better some theorems of J.~Desmet, I.~Gorshkov, S.~Shpectorov, and A.~Staroletov about solid subalgebras; this approach produces generic examples, including an example of an axial algebra of Jordan type 1/2 with a Frobenius form having radical 0, which is neither Jordan nor a homomorphic image of a Matsuo algebra.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19975.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19975.pdf)

**摘要**: Bounded composition operators in Paley-Wiener spaces have simple forms, and they are just operators composed through affine mappings of the complex plane. The purpose of this article is to explore some notions about bounded operators and linear dynamics and provide complete answers for composition operators in Paley-Wiener spaces concerning compactness, spectrum, spectral radius, Li-Yorke chaos, positive expansivity, positive shadowing property, and absolute Cesàro boundedness.

## 228. Linear viscoelasticity: Mechanics, analysis and approximation

**作者**: Michael Ortiz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03485.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03485.pdf)

**摘要**: The aim of this review is to highlight the connection between well-established physical and mathematical principles as they pertain to the theory of linear viscoelasticity. We begin by examining the physical foundations of Boltzmann and Volterra's hereditary law formalism, and how those principles restrict the form of the hereditary law. We then turn to questions of material stability and continuous dependence on the stress history within the framework of the Lax-Milgram theorem, which we find to set forth rigorous and unequivocal conditions for the well-posedness of the linear viscoelastic problem. The outcome of this analysis is remarkable in that it gives precise meaning to fundamental physical properties such as fading memory. Finally, we turn to the question of best representation of viscoelastic materials by finite-rank hereditary operators or, equivalently, by a finite set of history or internal variables. We note that the theory of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and $N$-widths supplies the answer to the question.

## 229. Existence and large radial solutions for an elliptic system under finite new Keller-Osserman integral conditions

**作者**: Dragos-Patru Covei

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04099.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04099.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the semilinear elliptic system
\[ \Delta u = p(|x|)\,g(v), \qquad \Delta v = q(|x|)\,f(u), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^n,\; n \geq 3, \]
under new Keller--Osserman-type integral conditions on the nonlinearities $f,g$ and decay constraints on the radial weights $p,q$. Within this framework we prove: (i) existence of infinitely many entire positive radial solutions for admissible central values; (ii) closedness of the set of all admissible central values; and (iii) largeness (blow-up at infinity) of solutions at boundary points. The analysis combines comparison principles, compactness arguments, and Keller--Osserman transforms, thereby extending classical theory to coupled elliptic systems with general nonlinearities and weights.

**作者**: Ryota Akagi, Zhichao Chen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06486.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06486.pdf)

**摘要**: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.

## 231. Sign-coherence and tropical sign pattern for rank $3$ real cluster-cyclic exchange matrices

**作者**: Ryota Akagi, Zhichao Chen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07454.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07454.pdf)

**摘要**: The sign-coherence about $c$-vectors was conjectured by Fomin-Zelevinsky and solved completely by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich for integer skew-symmetrizable case. We prove this conjecture associated with $c$-vectors for rank 3 real cluster-cyclic skew-symmetrizable case. Simultaneously, we establish their self-contained recursion and monotonicity. Then, these $c$-vectors are proved to be roots of certain quadratic equations. Based on these results, we prove that the corresponding exchange graphs of $C$-pattern and $G$-pattern are $3$-regular trees. We also study the structure of tropical signs and equip the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_6$ with a cluster realization via certain mutations.

## 232. Transgressive Harmonic Maps and SU(1,1) Self-Duality Solutions

**作者**: Sebastian Heller, Lothar Schiemanowski, Hartmut Weiss

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09497.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09497.pdf)

**摘要**: We establish a duality between harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces to hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces to de Sitter three-space $\operatorname{dS}_3$, best viewed as a generalized Gauss map. On the gauge theoretic side, it matches SU(2) and SU(1,1) solutions of Hitchin's self-duality equations via a signature flip along an eigenline of the Higgs field. Reversing this operation typically produces singular solutions, occurring where the eigenline becomes lightlike. Motivated by explicit model examples and this singular behavior, we extend this duality to a class of transgressive harmonic maps $f:M\to \mathbb{S}^3$: these are harmonic on the hemispheres equipped with the hyperbolic metric, intersect the equator orthogonally, and have vanishing Hopf differential along the crossing set. We construct large families by gluing and analyze their regularity, and as an application obtain $\tau$-real negative sections of the Deligne--Hitchin moduli space of arbitrarily large energy that are not twistor lines.

## 233. Consensus-Based Optimization Beyond Finite-Time Analysis

**作者**: Pascal Bianchi, Radu-Alexandru Dragomir, Victor Priser

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12907.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12907.pdf)

**摘要**: We analyze a zeroth-order particle algorithm for the global optimization of a non-convex function, focusing on a variant of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) with small but fixed noise intensity. Unlike most previous studies restricted to finite horizons, we investigate its long-time behavior with fixed parameters. In the mean-field limit, a quantitative Laplace principle shows exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the minimizer x * . For finitely many particles, a block-wise analysis yields explicit error bounds: individual particles achieve long-time consistency near x * , and the global best particle converge to x * . The proof technique combines a quantitative Laplace principle with block-wise control of Wasserstein distances, avoiding the exponential blow-up typical of Gr{ö}nwall-based estimates.

## 234. Geodesic clustering of zeros of Eisenstein series for congruence groups

**作者**: Sebastián Carrillo Santana, Gunther Cornelissen, Berend Ringeling

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16108.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16108.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $\Gamma$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $\Gamma(1)$-conjugates of $\Gamma$ in the standard fundamental domain for $\Gamma(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $\kappa_\Gamma + O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2\pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $\Gamma(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.

## 235. Enveloping semigroups as compactifications of topological groups

**作者**: K. L. Kozlov, B. V. Sorin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17577.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17577.pdf)

**摘要**: Ellis's "functional approach" allows one to obtain proper compactifications of a topological group $G$ if $G$ can be represented as a subgroup of the homeomorphism group of a space $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence and $G$-space $X$ is $G$-Tychonoff. These compactifications, called Ellis compactifications, are right topological monoids and $G$-compactifications of the group $G$ with its action by multiplication on the left on itself. A comparison is made between Ellis compactifications of $G$ and the Roelcke compactification of $G$. Uniformity corresponding to the Ellis compactification of $G$ for its representation in a compact space $X$ is established.
Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups ${\rm S}(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ of LOTS $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence.

## 236. Commutativity of operator algebras

**作者**: David P. Blecher

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17673.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17673.pdf)

**摘要**: We call an operator algebra A {\em reversible} if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the {\em symmetric operator algebras}: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relations from mathematical physics play a significant role.

## 237. Multi-order Runge-Kutta methods or how to numerically solve initial value problems of any order

**作者**: Loris Petronijevic

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23513.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23513.pdf)

**摘要**: When one wishes to numerically solve an initial value problem, it is customary to rewrite it as an equivalent first-order system to which a method, usually from the class of Runge-Kutta methods, is applied. Directly treating higher-order initial value problems without such rewriting, however, allows for significantly greater accuracy. We therefore introduce a new generalization of Runge-Kutta methods, called multi-order Runge-Kutta methods, designed to solve initial value problems of arbitrary order. We establish fundamental properties of these methods, including convergence, order of consistency, and linear stability. We also analyze the structure of the system satisfied by the approximations of a method, which enables us to provide a proper definition of explicit methods and to gain a finer understanding of implicit methods.

## 238. Markoff triples and Nielsen equivalence in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$

**作者**: Daniel E. Martin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07577.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07577.pdf)

**摘要**: In 2013, Darryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley made a series of conjectures that describe the Nielsen equivalence classes and $T_2$-equivalence classes of pairs of generators for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the Markoff equivalence classes of triples in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ that solve $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+\kappa$ for some $\kappa\in\mathbb{F}_q$. (The case $\kappa=0$ was originally conjectured by Baragar in 1991.) We prove that one of the McCullough-Wanderley conjectures, the "Q-Classification Conjecture" on Markoff triples, implies the others. Then we prove that the Q-Classification Conjecture holds if $q=p$ is a prime such that $24{,}504{,}480$ does not divide $p^2-1$. More generally, for any integer $d$, we reduce the Q-Classification Conjecture for all primes $p\not\equiv \pm 1\,\text{mod}\,d$ to checking whether a roughly $2d\times 2d$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{Q}[\kappa]$ is invertible. We (and SageMath) perform this invertibility check for all prime powers $d$ up to $17$, hence the modulus $24{,}504{,}480=2\text{lcm}(1,2,\dots,17)$.

## 239. On Minimax Estimation Problems for Periodically Correlated Stochastic Processes

**作者**: Iryna Dubovets'ka, Mykhailo Moklyachuk

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16906.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16906.pdf)

**摘要**: The aim of this article is to overview the problem of mean square optimal estimation of linear functionals which depend on unknown values of periodically correlated stochastic process. Estimates are based on observations of this process and noise. These problems are investigated under conditions of spectral certainty and spectral uncertainty. Formulas for calculating the main characteristics (spectral characteristic, mean square error) of the optimal linear estimates of the functionals are proposed. The least favorable spectral densities and the minimax-robust spectral characteristics of optimal estimates of the functionals are presented for given sets of admissible spectral densities.

## 240. Diffusion operators on $p$-adic analytic manifolds

**作者**: Patrick Erik Bradley

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22563.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22563.pdf)

**摘要**: Kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators are constructed on $p$-adic analytic manifolds using charts and transition maps from an atlas with connected nerve complex. In the compact case, an operator of Vladimirov-Taibleson type parametrised by a real parameter $s$ is defined. Its kernel function uses a geodetic-like distance function on the nerve complex of its atlas. The $L^2$-spectrum of this operator is established, and it is shown that it gives rise to a Feller semigroup. In this way, the Cauchy problem for the corresponding heat equation is solved in the positive by a transition function of a Markov process. The existence of a heat kernel function and a Green function in the case $s > 1$ is proven. As an application, it is shown how to express the number of points on the reduction curve defined over the residue field of an elliptic curve with good reduction in terms of the eigenvalues of a Vladimirov-Taibleson-like operator. This provides for an alternative way of counting points on elliptic curves defined over finite fields.

**作者**: M. Klazar, R. Horský

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00914.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00914.pdf)

**摘要**: Using the semiformal method in combinatorics we generalize Pólya's theorem. This theorem determines the limiting probability that walks in the grid graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ visit the given vertex. We generalize it to the countable complete graph $K_{\mathbb{N}}$ with edge weights in $\mathbb{C}$. In part II we treat edge weights in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,\dots,x_k]]$.

**作者**: Benjamin Hinrichs, Steffen Polzer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02867.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02867.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.

## 243. A Variational Approach to Planar Choreographies via Ekeland's Principle

**作者**: Juan Manuel Sánchez-Cerritos, Mayte Torres-Hernández

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03134.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03134.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a variational approach to obtain periodic solutions of the $N$-body problem, in particular the 'figure-eight' solution for three equal masses. The central idea is to explicitly optimize the \emph{spatial scale} within the Lagrangian action, leading to the functional $\mathcal F = K^{\alpha/(\alpha+2)} V^{2/(\alpha+2)}$. We prove the existence of critical points of $\mathcal F$ that enforce a curve with a single self-crossing, and show that every reparametrized critical curve satisfies Newton's equations and is free of collisions. This framework recovers the Chenciner-Montgomery 'eight' (for $\alpha=1$) and extends to the whole range $0<\alpha<2$.

## 244. VC-dimension of Salem sets over finite fields

**作者**: Moustapha Diallo, Brian McDonald

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08963.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08963.pdf)

**摘要**: The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension.
These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.

## 245. Properly Outer Actions of Tensor Categories on C$^*$-algebras

**作者**: Roberto Hernández Palomares, Miho Mukohara

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09991.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09991.pdf)

**摘要**: We discuss proper outerness for finite index endomorphisms and finite index bimodules of simple C$^*$-algebras, extending recent similar results by Izumi concerning the purely infinite setting. Our main result is that proper outerness holds automatically for finite index outer endomorphisms of simple C$^*$-algebras. Consequently, freeness for outer actions of unitary tensor categories on simple C$^*$-algebras is also shown to hold automatically. As applications, we obtain structural results about potentially infinite index irreducible discrete inclusions of C$^*$-algebras, such as C$^*$-irreducibility.

## 246. Weighted sums of Lucas numbers of the first and second kind

**作者**: aBa Mbirika

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10797.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10797.pdf)

**摘要**: In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.

## 247. Harmonic maps to Hadamard spaces and a universal higher Teichmüller space

**作者**: J. Maxwell Riestenberg, Peter Smillie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11469.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11469.pdf)

**摘要**: We give a sufficient criterion, which we call stability, for a coarse Lipschitz map $f$ from a complete manifold $X$ with Ricci curvature bounded below to a proper Hadamard space $Y$ to be within bounded distance of a harmonic map. We prove uniqueness of the harmonic map under additional assumptions on $X$ and $Y$.
Using this criterion, we prove a significant generalization of the Schoen-Li-Wang conjecture on quasi-isometric embeddings between rank 1 symmetric spaces. In particular, under a natural generalization of the quasi-isometric condition, we remove the assumption that the target has rank 1. This allows us to define a universal Hitchin component for each $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$, generalizing universal Teichmüller space, and show that it can be described both as a space of quasi-symmetric positive maps from $\mathbb{RP}^1$ to the flag variety, and as a space of harmonic maps.

## 248. Guessing Decoding of Short Blocklength Codes

**作者**: Qianfan Wang, Jifan Liang, Peihong Yuan, Ken R. Duffy, Muriel Médard, Xiao Ma

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12108.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12108.pdf)

**摘要**: Future beyond-5G and 6G systems demand ultra-reliable, low-latency communication with short blocklengths, motivating the development of universal decoding algorithms. Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications.

## 249. $m$-partite oriented semiregular representation of valency 3 for finite groups

**作者**: Songnian Xu, Dein Wong, Wenhao Zhen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12660.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12660.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $G$ be a finite group and $m \geq 2$ a positive integer. We say that $G$ admits an \emph{oriented $m$-semiregular representation} (abbreviated as OmSR) if there exists a $m$-Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ over $G$ such that $\Gamma$ is oriented and $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$. In \cite{xu1}, we classified finite groups generated by at most two elements that admit an OmSR of valency 3 for $m \geq 2$ and $G \ncong \mathbb{Z}_1$. In this article, we consider $m$-partite this http URL say a finite group $G$ admits an \emph{$m$-partite oriented semiregular representation} ($m$-partite digraphical representation), abbreviated as \emph{$m$-POSR} (\emph{$m$-PDR}), if there exists an \emph{oriented} $m$-partite Cayley digraph (\emph{$m$-partite Cayley digraph}) $\Gamma$ with $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$. In this paper, we classify finite groups generated by at most two elements that admit $m$-POSR. Since if $G$ admits an $m$-POSR, then $G$ must also admit an $m$-PDR (while the converse does not hold), as a natural consequence, we also provide a complete classification for groups $G=\langle x,y\rangle$ that admit $m$-PDR of valency 3. This complements the results in \cite{xu2}.

**作者**: Dmitri Finkelshtein, Eugene Lytvynov, Maria Joao Oliveira

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14898.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14898.pdf)

**摘要**: Let $\Phi$ be an (LB)-space over $\mathbb F=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$, and let $\Phi'$ be the dual space of~$\Phi$. We study the set $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ of Sheffer operators acting in polynomials on $\Phi'$. We prove that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is a group for the usual product of operators. We equip $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ with a natural topology which makes $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ into an infinite-dimensional manifold with a global parametrization. We show that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is an infinite-dimensional, regular Lie group, and provide an explicit description of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb S(\Phi)$, including an explicit form of the Lie bracket on it. Our main results are new even in the one-dimensional case, $\Phi=\mathbb{F}$. Furthermore, our results lead to improved understanding of the Lie algebra of the Riordan group, cf.\ Cheon, Luzón, Morón, Prieto-Martinez, {\it Adv. Math.} 319 (2017) 522--566.

## 252. Axiomatising the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces

**作者**: Jan Paseka, Thomas Vetterlein

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15410.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15410.pdf)

**摘要**: We axiomatise the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, using exclusively purely categorical conditions. Our axioms are chosen with the aim of an easy interpretability: two of them describe the composition of objecs, two further ones deal with the decomposition of objects, and a final axiom expresses a symmetry property.
The categorical reconstruction of complex Hilbert spaces addresses foundational issues in quantum physics. We present a simplified alternative to recent characterisations.

## 253. Edge-spectral Turán theorems for color-critical graphs with applications

**作者**: Yongtao Li, Hong Liu, Shengtong Zhang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15431.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15431.pdf)

**摘要**: A classical result of Nosal asserts that every $m$-edge graph with spectral radius $\lambda (G)> \sqrt{m}$ contains a triangle. A celebrated extension of Nikiforov [35] states that if $G$ is an $m$-edge graph with $\lambda (G)> \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, then $G$ contains a clique $K_{r+1}$. This result implies the Turán theorem and Wilf theorem, and offers a new perspective on the existence of substructures. The edge-spectral conditions are versatile for enforcing substructures, as they can be applied to any sparse graph regardless of its edge density. In this paper, we prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $\chi (F)=r+1\ge 4$, if $m$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular complete $r$-partite graph. This settles an open problem proposed by Yu and Li [52] and also gives spectral bounds for graphs forbidding books and wheels.
Secondly, we establish an asymptotic formula and structural characterization when we forbid an almost-bipartite graph $F$, where $F$ is called almost-bipartite if it can be made bipartite by removing at most one edge. As applications, we determine the unique $m$-edge spectral extremal graph for every integer $m$ when avoiding certain substructures, including complete bipartite graphs plus an edge, cycles plus an edge, and theta graphs, etc. Our results resolve an open problem proposed by Li, Zhao and Zou [24], as well as two conjectures posed by Liu and Li [31]. The arguments in our proofs are based on the edge-spectral stability method recently established by the authors. In addition, we develop some new spectral techniques, including the stability result for the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector.

## 254. New Empirical Process Tools and Their Applications to Robust Deep ReLU Networks and Phase Transitions for Nonparametric Regression

**作者**: Yizhe Ding, Runze Li, Lingzhou Xue

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15841.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15841.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper introduces new empirical process tools for analyzing a broad class of statistical learning models under heavy-tailed noise and complex function classes. Our primary contribution is the derivation of two Dudley-type maximal inequalities for expected empirical processes that remove restrictive assumptions such as light tails and uniform boundedness of the function class. These inequalities enlarge the scope of empirical process theory available for statistical learning and nonparametric estimation. Exploiting the new bounds, we establish robustness guarantees for deep ReLU network estimators in Huber and quantile regression. In particular, we prove a unified non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian concentration bound that remains valid even under infinite-variance noise and provide a comprehensive analysis of non-asymptotic robustness for deep Huber estimators across all noise regimes. For deep quantile regression, we provide the first non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian bounds without requiring moment assumptions. As an additional application, our framework yields estimation error bounds for nonparametric least-squares estimators that simultaneously accommodate infinite-variance noise, non-Donsker function classes, and approximation error. Moreover, unlike prior approaches based on specialized multiplier processes, our framework extends to broader empirical risk minimization problems, including the nonparametric generalized linear models and the ``set-structured'' models.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16561.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16561.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper, we give an expository presentation of the paper of Olivier Mathieu. The paper of Mathieu proves that a Lie group-theoretic conjecture implies the Jacobian Conjecture. To give Mathieu's proof, we first review the required literature on representation theory in an expository way. We continue to prove some results on the irreducible subrepresentations of the tensor algebra of the standard representation of $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$. The last part of the paper is dedicated to Mathieu's proof.

## 256. Toward Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry

**作者**: Han Zheng, Zimu Li, Sergii Strelchuk, Risi Kondor, Junyu Liu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07250.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07250.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.

## 257. The Complexity Classes of Hamming Distance Recoverable Robust Problems

**作者**: Christoph Grüne

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06939.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06939.pdf)

**摘要**: In the well-known complexity class NP are combinatorial problems, whose optimization counterparts are important for many practical settings. These problems typically consider full knowledge about the input. In practical settings, however, uncertainty in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby this is normally not covered in optimization versions of NP problems. One concept to model the uncertainty in the input data, is recoverable robustness. The instance of the recoverable robust version of a combinatorial problem P is split into a base scenario $\sigma_0$ and an uncertainty scenario set $\textsf{S}$. The base scenario and all members of the uncertainty scenario set are instances of the original combinatorial problem P. The task is to calculate a solution $s_0$ for the base scenario $\sigma_0$ and solutions $s$ for all uncertainty scenarios $\sigma \in \textsf{S}$ such that $s_0$ and $s$ are not too far away from each other according to a distance measure, so $s_0$ can be easily adapted to $s$. This paper introduces Hamming Distance Recoverable Robustness, in which solutions $s_0$ and $s$ have to be calculated, such that $s_0$ and $s$ may only differ in at most $\kappa$ elements. We survey the complexity of Hamming distance recoverable robust versions of optimization problems, typically found in NP for different scenario encodings. The complexity is primarily situated in the lower levels of the polynomial hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is a gadget reduction framework that shows that the recoverable robust versions of problems in a large class of combinatorial problems is $\Sigma^P_{3}$-complete. This class includes problems such as Vertex Cover, Coloring or Subset Sum. Additionally, we expand the results to $\Sigma^P_{2m+1}$-completeness for multi-stage recoverable robust problems with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ stages.

## 258. Minimax Statistical Estimation under Wasserstein Contamination

**作者**: Patrick Chao, Edgar Dobriban

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01853.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01853.pdf)

**摘要**: Contaminations are a key concern in modern statistical learning, as small but systematic perturbations of all datapoints can substantially alter estimation results. Here, we study Wasserstein-$r$ contaminations ($r\ge 1$) in an $\ell_q$ norm ($q\in [1,\infty]$), in which each observation may undergo an adversarial perturbation with bounded cost, complementing the classical Huber model, corresponding to total variation norm, where only a fraction of observations is arbitrarily corrupted. We study both independent and joint (coordinated) contaminations and develop a minimax theory under $\ell_q^r$ losses.
Our analysis encompasses several fundamental problems: location estimation, linear regression, and pointwise nonparametric density estimation. For joint contaminations in location estimation and for prediction in linear regression, we obtain the exact minimax risk, identify least favorable contaminations, and show that the sample mean and least squares predictor are respectively minimax optimal. For location estimation under independent contaminations, we give sharp upper and lower bounds, including exact minimaxity in the Euclidean Wasserstein contamination case, when $q=r=2$. For pointwise density estimation in any dimension, we derive the optimal rate, showing that it is achieved by kernel density estimation with a bandwidth that is possibly larger than the classical one.
Our proofs leverage powerful tools from optimal transport developed over the last 20 years, including the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation. Taken together, our results suggest that in contrast to the Huber contamination model, for norm-based Wasserstein contaminations, classical estimators may be nearly optimally robust.

## 259. Relative Arbitrage Opportunities in an Extended Mean Field System

**作者**: Nicole Tianjiao Yang, Tomoyuki Ichiba

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02690.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02690.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper studies relative arbitrage opportunities in a market with competitive investors through stochastic differential games in the limit as the number of players tends to infinity. With common noises introduced by the stock capitalization processes, we establish a conditional McKean-Vlasov system to study the market dynamics coupled to the expected trading volume of investors. We show that optimal arbitrage can be characterized as a solution of a Cauchy PDE constructed by the volatility terms in the market model. The structure of the market dynamics can be relaxed, and we provide a theoretical framework to study a general mean-field system, where the interaction is characterized by a joint distribution of wealth and strategies. In this setting, the optimal relative arbitrage constitutes the strong equilibrium of an extended mean-field game. We provide conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium. We further prove the propagation of chaos result for the finite-player game counterpart, and demonstrate that the Nash equilibrium converges to the mean field equilibrium when the population grows to infinity.

## 260. Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy for many natural Problems in Bilevel and Robust Optimization

**作者**: Christoph Grüne, Lasse Wulf

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10540.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10540.pdf)

**摘要**: In bilevel and robust optimization we are concerned with combinatorial min-max problems, for example from the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the classes $\Sigma^p_2$ or $\Sigma^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy, almost no hardness results in this regime are currently known. However, such complexity insights are important, since they imply that no polynomial-sized integer program for these min-max problems exist, and hence conventional IP-based approaches fail. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $\Sigma^p_2$-complete and $\Sigma^p_3$-complete problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $\Sigma^p_2$- and $\Sigma^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Precisely, we introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). We show that for every single of these problems, the corresponding min-max (i.e. interdiction/regret) variant is $\Sigma^p_2$- and the min-max-min (i.e. two-stage) variant is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete.

## 262. On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents

**作者**: Rajeev Singh

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02127.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02127.pdf)

**摘要**: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.

## 263. Optimal risk mitigation by deep reinsurance

**作者**: Aleksandar Arandjelović, Julia Eisenberg

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06168.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06168.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cramér-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11655.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11655.pdf)

**摘要**: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fröhlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.

## 265. Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems

**作者**: David Auger, Pierre Coucheney, Kossi Roland Etse

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18364.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18364.pdf)

**摘要**: We develop a unified framework for rotor-routing that extends the classical model to a broad class of multigraphs equipped with Generalized Rotor Mechanisms (GRM). This perspective places rotor-routing on the same footing as abelian sandpiles by interpreting both as conservative instances of Vector Addition Systems (VAS). Within this framework, routing becomes a linear transformation governed by arc mechanisms, while legality is enforced through non-negativity constraints.
We introduce four routing models -- free routing, standard rotor-routing, cyclic GRM routing, and fully general GRM routing -- and study their reachability problems in both the linear and legal settings. Our results generalize previous characterizations for standard rotor-routing and extend them to the GRM setting. In particular, we show that legal reachability in GRM multigraphs is NP-complete, whereas the cyclic GRM routing model, which includes the classical rotor-router, admits a polynomial-time algorithm.

**摘要**: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.

## 267. Can Nash inform capital requirements? Allocating systemic risk measures

**作者**: Çağın Ararat, Zachary Feinstein

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20413.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20413.pdf)

**摘要**: Systemic risk measures aggregate the risks from multiple financial institutions to find system-wide capital requirements. Though much attention has been given to assessing the level of systemic risk, less has been given to allocating that risk to the constituent institutions. Within this work, we propose a Nash allocation rule that is inspired by game theory. Intuitively, to construct these capital allocations, the banks compete in a game to reduce their own capital requirements while, simultaneously, maintaining system-level acceptability. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Nash allocation rules, and apply our results to the prominent structures used for systemic risk measures in the literature. We demonstrate the efficacy of Nash allocations with numerical case studies using the Eisenberg-Noe aggregation mechanism.

## 268. A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity

**作者**: Leo Hahn

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02274.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02274.pdf)

**摘要**: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching, we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching.

## 269. A stringy dispersion relation for field theory

**作者**: Faizan Bhat, Arnab Priya Saha, Aninda Sinha

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03862.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03862.pdf)

**摘要**: We derive a local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) for 2-2 scattering amplitudes with a parametric ambiguity motivated by string theory. Various limits of the parameter lead to the fixed-t, fixed-s, and other known CSDRs. We also present formulae for higher-subtracted cases. Several examples are discussed for illustration. In particular, for the Veneziano and the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes, we derive parametric series representations which manifest poles in all channels and converge everywhere. We then discuss applications of our formalism for bootstrapping weakly-coupled gravitational EFTs. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the graviton pole, one can derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients while working in the forward limit, with the parameter acting as the IR regulator instead. Finally, we derive series representations for multi-variable, totally symmetric generalisations of the Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes that manifest poles in all the variables. This is a first step towards dispersion relations for n-particle scattering amplitudes.

## 270. Soft decision trees for survival analysis

**作者**: Antonio Consolo, Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Carrizosa

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16846.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16846.pdf)

**摘要**: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15 well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended to consider group fairness.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01904.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01904.pdf)

**摘要**: We explicitly construct a class of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series which is conjectured in our previous paper [Alkalaev & Mandrygin 2025] to calculate multipoint one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Our approach is based on a simple diagrammatic algorithm which systematically builds both arguments and series coefficients in terms of a convex polygon which is part of the Baxter lattice. The examples of the box, pentagon, and hexagon integrals are considered in detail.

## 272. Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data

**作者**: Alberto Almuna-Morales, Danilo Aballay, Pierre Gélat, Reza Haqshenas, Elwin van 't Wout

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11100.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11100.pdf)

**摘要**: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.

## 273. Divide, Interact, Sample: The Two-System Paradigm

**作者**: James Chok, Myung Won Lee, Daniel Paulin, Geoffrey M. Vasil

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09162.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09162.pdf)

**摘要**: Mean-field, ensemble-chain, and adaptive samplers have historically been viewed as distinct approaches to Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we present a unifying {two-system} framework that brings all three under one roof. In our approach, an ensemble of particles is split into two interacting subsystems that propose updates for each other in a symmetric, alternating fashion. This cross-system interaction ensures that the overall ensemble has $\rho(x)$ as its invariant distribution in both the finite-particle setting and the mean-field limit. The two-system construction reveals that ensemble-chain samplers can be interpreted as finite-$N$ approximations of an ideal mean-field sampler; conversely, it provides a principled recipe to discretize mean-field Langevin dynamics into tractable parallel MCMC algorithms. The framework also connects naturally to adaptive single-chain methods: by replacing particle-based statistics with time-averaged statistics from a single chain, one recovers analogous adaptive dynamics in the long-time limit without requiring a large ensemble. We derive novel two-system versions of both overdamped and underdamped Langevin MCMC samplers within this paradigm. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world posterior inference tasks, these two-system samplers exhibit significant performance gains over the popular No-U-Turn Sampler, achieving an order of magnitude higher effective sample sizes per gradient evaluation.

## 274. Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory

**作者**: Ansh Nagda, Prabhakar Raghavan, Abhradeep Thakurta

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18057.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18057.pdf)

**摘要**: Can AI based methods help us make advances in complexity theory? We provide evidence towards answering this in the affirmative, using AlphaEvolve (an LLM code mutation agent) to obtain new results in three settings:
a) We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ vertices, and our upper bounds are obtained via analytical arguments.
b) We obtain new inapproximability results for MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate them within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP (rather than a reduction from ``standard'' Håstad-style PCPs).
c) Inapproximability for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum cost tour within a factor of $111/110$ using AlphaEvolve to discover a new gadget, thus improving the SOTA of $117/116$. Along the way, we provide new modular soundness and completeness arguments that can be of independent interest.
A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (sometimes requiring time exponential in the size of the construction). We used AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$ for our gadgets). Our results suggest that gadget based proofs would benefit from a pass through AI-based tools to obtain stronger results.

## 275. ResCP: Reservoir Conformal Prediction for Time Series Forecasting

**作者**: Roberto Neglia, Andrea Cini, Michael M. Bronstein, Filippo Maria Bianchi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05060.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05060.pdf)

**摘要**: Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.

## 276. A Spatio-temporal CP decomposition analysis of New England region in the US

**作者**: Fatoumata Sanogo

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10322.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10322.pdf)

**摘要**: Spatio temporal data consist of measurement for one or more raster fields such as weather, traffic volume, crime rate, or disease incidents. Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.

## 277. On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells

**作者**: Adriano Barra, Martino S. Centonze, Michela Marra Solazzo, Daniele Tantari

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02441.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02441.pdf)

**摘要**: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -- yet preserving the same resolution -- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -- analytically -- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -- numerically -- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.

## 278. A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series

**作者**: Xuyang Li, John Harlim, Dibyajyoti Chakraborty, Romit Maulik

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06609.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06609.pdf)

**摘要**: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems and real-world climate dataset.

**作者**: Puskar Mondal, Shing-Tung Yau

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09508.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09508.pdf)

**摘要**: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf)

**摘要**: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.

## 281. Debordering Closure Results in Determinantal and Pfaffian Ideals

**作者**: Anakin Dey, Zeyu Guo

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16492.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16492.pdf)

**摘要**: One important question in algebraic complexity is understanding the complexity of polynomial ideals (Grochow, Bulletin of EATCS 131, 2020). Andrews and Forbes (STOC 2022) studied the determinantal ideals $I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$ generated by the $r\times r$ minors of $n\times m$ matrices. Over fields of characteristic zero or of sufficiently large characteristic, they showed that for any nonzero $f \in I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$, the determinant of a $t \times t$ matrix of variables with $t = \Theta(r^{1/3})$ is approximately computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit, in the sense that the determinant lies in the border of such circuits. An analogous result was also obtained for Pfaffians in the same paper.
In this work, we deborder the result of Andrews and Forbes by showing that when $f$ has polynomial degree, the determinant is in fact exactly computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit. We further establish an analogous result for Pfaffian ideals.
Our results are established using the isolation lemma, combined with a careful analysis of straightening-law expansions of polynomials in determinantal and Pfaffian ideals.
