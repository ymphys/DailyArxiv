## 1. Pedagogic Null Tests of Dynamical Dark Energy Hints: Reconstructing LambdaCDM with Consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe Mocks

**作者**: Seokcheon Lee

**摘要**: Hints of a dynamical dark-energy equation of state have appeared in several combined cosmological probes. However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors.

## 2. No Pulsar Detected in Reprocessed Archival Parkes Observations of SNR 1987A

**作者**: Fronefield Crawford, Haoyang Xu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16706.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16706.pdf)

**摘要**: We have reprocessed the available archival radio pulsar search observations of SNR 1987A taken with the Parkes 64-m telescope, some of which have not been previously published. We conducted a standard periodicity search on these data as well as a single pulse search at a range of dispersion measures. We found no convincing candidate signals, and we calculate flux density, luminosity, and single pulse fluence limits from these observations. The derived luminosity limits are comparable to the luminosities of three young, energetic pulsars (the Crab pulsar, PSR B0540$-$69, and PSR J0537$-$6910), and so we cannot rule out the existence of a pulsar in SNR 1987A with a similar radio luminosity.

## 3. Habitable from the start: How initial planetary formation conditions may create habitable worlds

**作者**: Benjamin J. Farcy, Darryl Z. Seligman, Kathleen E. Mandt, John W. Noonan, Sarah E. Anderson

**摘要**: The breadth of topics that encompass the search for life has expanded and evolved significantly since the emergence of the field of astrobiology. Initial astrobiology centered investigations focused on detecting biosignatures in the Martian soil with the Viking lander. The field now encompasses identification of biosignatures throughout the galaxy and habitable worlds, planets with sufficient liquid water and prebiotic chemistry to support life. This evolution mirrors the improvement in our understanding of environments that may harbor life. The bulk planetary chemistry governs the habitability of a planet, which is in turn set by the early solar system environment and planet formation processes. Therefore, investigations of solar and exoplanetary systems as a whole would provide insights into the factors that make a planet habitable. Bulk planetary chemistry govern planetary atmospheres, core sizes, magnetic fields, heat engines, volatile inventories, and silicate mantle compositions. We therefore advocate for investigations of formation conditions that establish planetary chemistry, and by extension, habitability.

## 4. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in the Milky Way's central parsec

**作者**: Mark Gorski, Lena Murchikova

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16720.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16720.pdf)

**摘要**: Carbon monoxide (CO) emission is a widely used tracer of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the interstellar medium (ISM), owing to its abundance, low excitation energy, and ease of detection in cold molecular environments, in contrast to $\mathrm{H}_2$ itself. While the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor is often assumed to be constant across the disks of galaxies, deviations are observed in extreme environments such as the central molecular zone (CMZ) in galactic nuclei. Here we present the first estimate of the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor on sub-kpc scales. We calculate CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion in the Milky Way's Circumnuclear Disk/Ring (CND/CNR) at $\sim 1$ pc radius around the Galactic Center black hole. We derive a conversion factor of $\alpha_\mathrm{CO} \simeq 4.5\pm2.5 \, M_\odot (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1} pc^2})^{-1}$ or X[CO] $\simeq (2.1\pm1.1)\times 10^{20} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1}})^{-1}$. This value is consistent with the Galactic disk but higher than CMZ.

**摘要**: Sub-Neptune planets, with no analogue in our solar system, provide a wealth of information about exoplanet diversity, formation & evolution, and habitability. Their robust characterisation requires the coupling of physically informed atmosphere and interior models with precise atmospheric data to break compositional degeneracies. Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-270 d revealed detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its H$_2$-rich atmosphere, with tentative inferences of H$_2$O and CS$_2$ and a non-detection of NH$_3$. We conduct a theoretical exploration of the range of possible interiors for TOI-270 d based on the current observational constraints. We carry out internal structure modelling using a coupled atmosphere-interior model, including self-consistent atmospheric temperature structures informed by JWST observations. The bulk properties permit solutions spanning mini-Neptune, gas dwarf and hycean scenarios, with a wide range of possible surface conditions, which are strongly dependent on the atmospheric properties, including the presence of clouds/hazes. We explore the solutions allowing for surface water oceans on TOI-270 d, including under potentially habitable conditions. The atmospheric mass fractions permitting habitable surface conditions are found to be $\lesssim$$3.5\times10^{-5}$ and pressures $\lesssim$100 bar for the envelope temperature structures considered. We consider mini-Neptune interiors that are sufficiently warm for H$_2$O to be mixed with the H$_2$-rich envelope. Finally, we consider possible gas dwarf interiors, finding H$_2$-rich envelope mass fractions of $\sim$$1-5$ % are required to satisfy the bulk properties, with surface pressures $\sim10^4-10^5$ bar. Further theoretical and experimental studies in addition to future atmospheric observations will aid the characterisation of the possible interior and surface conditions on TOI-270 d.

## 6. HIDES -- I. The population and diversity of HI-rich 'dark' galaxies in the Hestia and Auriga simulations

**作者**: Haonan Zheng, Fangzhou Jiang, Shihong Liao, Noam I. Libeskind

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16726.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16726.pdf)

**摘要**: We present our investigation of HI-rich 'Dark' galaxiEs in Simulations (HIDES), specifically using the Hestia and Auriga simulations in this work. We select galaxies that are faint ($M_g > -10$) and contain sufficient HI ($M_\mathrm{HI} > 10^5\,M_\odot$), and identify 89 such objects, only one of which is completely starless. Their demographics generally converge across simulations of different resolution, with $M_{200} \sim 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{gas} \sim 10^{7.4}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{HI} \sim 10^{6.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{*} \sim 10^{5.6}\,M_\odot$, low gas metallicity, little or no current star formation, and a mean stellar age of $\sim$ 11 Gyr, and with some of them can survive in dense environments as close as $\sim$ 300 kpc from a Milky-Way mass neighbor. We find a large scatter in their HI density profiles and $M_\mathrm{HI} - M_\mathrm{*}$ relation, which cannot be fully explained by current halo mass or concentration, but can be attributed to ram pressure stripping in dense environments, past mergers, and stellar feedback. In particular, close encounters with massive halos and dense environments can reshape the HI content, which may explain the asymmetric HI map of an intriguing observed analogue, Cloud-9. An empirical fit, $n = 0.25 \left(d_\mathrm{MW}/{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}\right)^{-1.4}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, based on their number density extended to 3.7 Mpc in constrained local volume simulations, is also provided to aid observational forecasts. We conclude that both mass assembly history and environmental history play a crucial role in the formation and subsequent diversity of these galaxies.

## 7. Radio-Continuum Spectra of Pulsars with Free-Free Thermal Absorption

**作者**: Mario G. Abadi, Gabriela Castelletti, Namir E. Kassim

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16728.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16728.pdf)

**摘要**: The radio continuum spectra of pulsars (PSRs) exhibit a wide variety of shapes, that are interpreted as pure and broken power laws, power laws with turnovers or cut-offs, and logarithmic-parabolic profiles. A notable fraction of these have well-defined power laws with $\nu^{-2.1}$ exponential turnovers, indicative of free-free thermal absorption along the line-of-site. We analyse a sample of 63 PSRs with such spectral shapes, compiled from four previously published studies, to investigate their statistical properties. We normalise each spectrum to a characteristic frequency and flux density of its own, facilitating a consistent treatment across the four sub-samples. We show these two fitted parameters are correlated by a power law, with its slope reflecting the median spectral index ($\alpha\sim -2.0$) of PSR emission. We found that the turnover frequencies in our sample are typically high, clustering around 558 MHz, implying notably high emission measures ($EM \sim 10^{5}$ pc cm$^{-6}$) for an inferred thermal absorbing medium with electron temperature of $T_{\mathrm{e}}=8000$ K. Moreover, by combining these $EM$ with dispersion measures (DM) derived from pulse time delays, we break the degeneracy between electron density and path length of the absorbers. This reveals a discrete near-in population of absorbers characterised by small sizes ($L \sim 0.1\,\text{pc}$) and high electron densities $(n_{\mathrm{e}} \sim 10^{3}\,\text{cm}^{-3} $)), which exhibit a clear size-density anticorrelation reminiscent of that observed in Galactic and extragalactic H$_\rm{II}$ regions.

## 8. Evolution mapping III: A new recipe for the halo mass function

**作者**: Andrea Fiorilli, Andrés N. Ruiz, Ariel G. Sanchez, Matteo Esposito

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16730.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16730.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a new prescription for the halo mass function (HMF) built upon the Evolution Mapping framework. This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\Delta$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\Delta=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\Delta$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\Delta$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime.

## 9. A search for cold molecular outflows in cosmic noon galaxies

**作者**: Ivanna Langan, Gergö Popping, Michele Ginolfi, Simon Weng, Francesco Valentino, Gareth Jones, Jan Scholtz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16733.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16733.pdf)

**摘要**: The flow of baryons in and out of galaxies is the primary driver for galaxy evolution. In addition to depleting the gas reservoir of galaxies, outflows also enrich their circumgalactic medium (CGM) with processed gas -- which can further impact the next stages of gas accretion, resulting in the presence of molecular gas beyond the stellar component of galaxies, out to CGM scales. Here, we aim to search for cold molecular gas (MH2) in the CGM of typical main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at cosmic noon (zmed=1.3), where we expect outflows to be particularly prominent. Using Band 3 CO(2-1) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the spatial extent of the MH2 of a sample of 26 SFGs, via stacking techniques. We compare this extent to that of the stacked stellar emission of our sample traced by UltraVISTA Ks band data. We also search for broad wings in the stacked spectrum which can be indicative of ongoing outflows. Within the noise level of the observations, we find that the total intrinsic MH2 of our sample spatially extends to scales of ~12 kpc, similarly to the stellar emission (~13 kpc). We do not find broad wings in the stacked spectrum that could hint at ongoing molecular outflows, but we find a tentative minor excess of CO(2-1) emission at negative velocities that might be indicative of outflows, where the redshifted gas is optically thick. The absence of high-velocity molecular gas suggests that molecular outflows traced by CO(2-1) emission are weak in MS SFGs at cosmic noon. These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances.

## 10. The 12CO Gas Structures of Protoplanetary Disks in the Upper Scorpius Region

**作者**: Luigi Zallio, Giovanni P. Rosotti, Miguel Vioque, Anna Miotello, Sean M. Andrews, Carlo F. Manara, John M. Carpenter, Aaron Empey, Nicolás T. Kurtovic, Charles J. Law, Cristiano Longarini, Teresa Paneque-Carreño, Richard Teague, Marion Villenave, Hsi-Wei Yen, Francesco Zagaria

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16734.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16734.pdf)

**摘要**: We present measurements of key protoplanetary disk properties inferred from parametric models of ALMA 12CO spectral line visibilities. We derive gas-disk radii, integrated fluxes, optically thick emission layers, and brightness temperature profiles for the disk population of the old (4 - 14 Myr) Upper Scorpius star-forming region. We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N > 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio <z/r> ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.

## 11. Zooming into the water snowline: high resolution water observations of the HL Tau disk

**作者**: M. Leemker, S. Facchini, P. Curone, L. Rampinelli, M. Benisty, A. Garufi, E. Humphreys

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16737.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16737.pdf)

**摘要**: Water is one of the central molecules for the formation and habitability of planets. In particular, the region where water freezes-out, the water snowline, could be a favorable location to form planets in protoplanetary disks. We use high resolution ALMA observations to spatially resolve H$_2$O, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and SO emission in the HL Tau disk. A rotational diagram analysis is used to characterize the water reservoir seen with ALMA and compare this to the reservoir visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the H$_2$O 183 GHz line has a compact central component and a diffuse component that is seen out to ~75 au. A radially resolved rotational diagram shows that the excitation temperature of the water is ~350 K independent of radius. The steep drop in the water brightness temperature outside the central beam of the observations where the emission is optically thick is consistent with the water snowline being located inside the central beam ($\lesssim 6$ au) at the height probed by the observations. Comparing the ALMA lines to those seen at shorter wavelengths shows that only 0.02%-2% of the water reservoir is visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths, respectively, due to optically thick dust hiding the emission whereas 35-70% is visible with ALMA. An anti-correlation between the H$_2$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission is found but this is likely caused by optically thick dust hiding the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission in the disk center. Finally, we see SO emission tracing the disk and for the first time in SO a molecular outflow and the infalling streamer out to ~2". The velocity structure hints at a possible connection between the SO and the H$_2$O emission. Spatially resolved observations of H$_2$O lines at (sub-)mm wavelengths provide valuable constraints on the location of the water snowline, while probing the bulk of the gas-phase reservoirs.

## 12. A continuous parameterization of the cosmic web

**作者**: C.Yamila Yaryura, Mario G. Abadi, Noam I. Libeskind, Stefan Gottlöber, Sofía A. Cora, Gustavo Yepes

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16744.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16744.pdf)

**摘要**: The intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by their environments, underscoring the environment's critical role in galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.

## 13. Validation of optical pathlength stability in a LISA test-bench demonstrator

**摘要**: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is a future L3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect gravitational waves, set to launch in 2035. The detector constellation will conduct interferometry to picometer stability over an unprecedented arm length of 2.5 million km. In this paper, we present the development and testing results for the Zerodur interferometer (ZIFO), an optical demonstrator built to validate critical technology for the test setup of the interferometric core of LISA. Optical path length stability measurements on the ZIFO demonstrate successful reduction of bench noise to maintain the 10 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ specification across the 1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band. We also identify and characterize dominant noise sources from phasemeters and correlations of beam tilt into the path length that were observed during the test campaign.

## 14. CLAWDIA: A dictionary learning framework for gravitational-wave data analysis

**作者**: Miquel Llorens-Monteagudo, Alejandro Torres-Forné, José A. Font

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16750.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16750.pdf)

**摘要**: Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.

## 15. Finding He II: Testing Novel Models of Binary Populations across Cosmic Time

**作者**: Beryl Hovis-Afflerbach, Allison L. Strom, Alberto Saldana-Lopez, Sophia R. Flury

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16752.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16752.pdf)

**摘要**: Our understanding of massive stars remains incomplete. Many high-z galaxies and nearby analogs exhibit strong He II emission, indicating an abundance of photons with energies >54.4 eV that standard single-star population models cannot explain. Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly.

## 16. The ViSta method for stacking in the Fourier domain and its application to the dusty star-forming galaxies in the ALMA Science Archive

**作者**: Martina Torsello, Marcella Massardi, Elisabetta Liuzzo, Gayathri Gururaian, Francesca Perrotta, Andrea Lapi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16753.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16753.pdf)

**摘要**: We present ViSta, a Visibility Stacking method to combine interferometric observations in the Fourier domain at radio to sub-millimeter wavelengths for galaxies. The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach.

## 17. Data-Driven Stellar Spectral Modelling with GSPICE

**作者**: Douglas P. Finkbeiner, Joshua S. Speagle, Tanveer Karim

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16754.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16754.pdf)

**摘要**: Spectral data reduction pipelines deal with a wide variety of challenges including masking cosmic rays, calibrating wavelength solutions, and estimating background noise while trying to remain model-agnostic. Traditional methods rely on hardware-specific code or pre-calculated stellar model templates to solve this problem, making them model-dependent and not suitable for large datasets that may contain new classes of objects. To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands. Implementations of GSPICE in both Python and IDL can be found here this http URL.

## 18. Turbulence in Core-Collapse Supernovae

**作者**: David Calvert, Michael Redle, Bibek Gautam, Charles J. Stapleford, Carla Fröhlich, James P. Kneller, Matthias Liebendorfer

**摘要**: It is understood in a general sense that turbulent fluid motion below the shock front in a core-collapse supernova stiffens the effective equation of state of the fluid and aids in the revival of the explosion. However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova.

## 19. An Investigation of Systematic Effects from Background Priors on PSR J0740$+$6620 Radius Estimates using Synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton Data

**作者**: Isiah M. Holt, M. Coleman Miller, Alexander J. Dittmann, Frederick K. Lamb

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16759.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16759.pdf)

**摘要**: Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\sim 2.1~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\sim1\sigma$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.

## 20. Ionizing radiation of [WR] stars: atmospheres and photoionization models

**作者**: L.V. Da Conceição, W.LF. Marcolino, V. Maria

**摘要**: The radiation field of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) is crucial for determining the physical conditions of planetary nebulae (PNe). Many studies in the literature model PNe using the blackbody approximation (bb) or plane-parallel (p-p) atmospheres as the ionizing source. However, these approaches become inconsistent when the central star is a Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type. These objects are hydrogen-deficient and exhibit intense stellar winds, similar to classical massive WR stars. Their accurate description therefore requires sophisticated NLTE expanding atmosphere models. In this work, we selected [WR] NLTE expanding-atmosphere models spanning a range of temperatures and mass-loss rates and compared them with bb and p-p models. We examined differences in the spectral energy distribution and ionizing photon fluxes for H I, He I, and He II to assess the impact of stellar winds on the nebula-star interaction. Using CLOUDY, we also evaluated how each ionizing source affects predicted line ratios (I$_{\lambda}$/I$_{\beta}$) for a sample of PNe with [WR] nuclei. Model performance was measured through the rms deviation between observed and predicted ratios. For temperatures below 100,000 K, the EUV spectrum differs strongly among the three model types. Stellar winds introduce substantial opacity, reducing log Q(He II) significantly relative to no-wind models. For hotter [WR] stars, wind effects on ionizing fluxes are much smaller. For nebulae hosting late-type [WR] stars, models including winds provide much better agreement with observed line ratios than bb or p-p models, whereas for early-type stars the choice of ionizing source has only a minor influence. Our results indicate that bb and p-p approximations should be avoided when modelling PNe with [WR] central stars, especially those of the [WCL] subtype, because they fail to reproduce the strong wind-modified ionizing spectra.

## 21. The nature of UHE source 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its connection to PSR J1740+1000

**作者**: Seth Gagnon, Yichao Lin, Alexander Lange, Hui Yang, Noel Klingler, Jeremy Hare, Oleg Kargaltsev

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16764.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16764.pdf)

**摘要**: We present multi-wavelength analysis of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its surroundings including the pulsar wind nebula of middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. Although a dozen X-ray sources are found within the UHE emission site, careful analysis shows that they are unlikely to produce the observed UHE emission. The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region. In this context, we discuss two possible scenarios: a tail filled with pulsar wind and confined by the bow-shock due to the fast pulsar's motion and an ISM filament filled by the most energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow-shock.

**摘要**: We develop an effective model to describe the dynamics of a system of particle moving in circular configurations around a central mass, by considering the continuum limit of the angular distribution, to obtain the stable configurations for different initial parameters. We compute the resulting fractal dimension and compare it with that of a statistical Cantor ring system.

## 23. A Comprehensive Analysis of the Panchromatic Transmission Spectrum of the Hot-Saturn WASP-96 b: Nondetection of Haze, Possible Sodium Limb Asymmetry, Stellar Characterization, and Formation History

**作者**: Le-Chris Wang, Zafar Rustamkulov, David K. Sing, Joshua Lothringer, Patrick McCreery, Daniel Thorngren, Munazza K. Alam

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16771.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16771.pdf)

**摘要**: We conduct a reanalysis of the JWST NIRISS/SOSS observation of the hot-Saturn WASP-96 b. Initial analysis of this data revealed an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope at the blue end of the transmission spectrum, suggesting the presence of hazes at high altitudes. In this work, we report non-detection of this slope, confirming an atmosphere clear of high-altitude aerosols consistent with the pre-JWST results. Also contrary to the initial result, our results indicate the presence of gray cloud deck, although at relatively low altitudes/high pressures. We further combined the NIRISS/SOSS spectrum with VLT, HST, and Spitzer to produce a transmission spectrum from 0.35 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m. We constrain the mass fraction of multiple chemical species, including: H$_2$O$=-2.62^{+0.43}_{-0.42}$, K$=-5.76^{+1.05}_{-1.13}$, and Na$=-3.40^{+0.90}_{-0.92}$. C/O ratio and metallicity are tentatively constrained at substellar values (C/O$_{planet}=0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and [Fe/H]$_{planet}=0.01^{+0.46}_{-0.52}$ compared to C/O$_{star}=0.92\pm0.25$ and [Fe/H]$_{star}=0.24\pm0.05$). Inputing these composition constraints to interior models, we constrain a core mass of $43^{+8}_{-15}$ M$_\oplus$. This, in addition to our inferred super-stellar refractory-to-oxygen ratio ($\Delta\log_{10}(R/O)=1.48^{+0.57}_{-0.62}$) and substellar C/O ratio, suggests that the core of WASP-96 b likely formed outside of water iceline, underwent disk-driven migration, and accreted its atmosphere inside the carbon soot line. We find evidence of atmospheric leading-trailing terminator asymmetries in the broadened sodium absorption feature with a transit time offset of 50 seconds, while the water features appear symmetric. CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$ remain unconstrained due to spectral coverage limits. Upcoming JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations (ID 4082, PI: M. Radica) will be crucial for constraining these carbon-bearing species.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16774.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16774.pdf)

**摘要**: AM CVn stars are ultra-compact semi-detached binaries consisting of a white dwarf primary and a hydrogen-depleted secondary. In this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric results of 15 transient sources pre-classified as AM CVn candidates. Our analysis confirms 9 systems of the type AM CVn, 3 hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs with near-main-sequence stars for donors) and 3 systems that could be evolved cataclysmic variables. Eight of the AM CVn stars are analysed spectroscopically for the first time, which increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed AM CVns by about $10\%$. TESS data revealed the orbital period of the AM CVn star ASASSN-20pv to be $P_\mathrm{orb}=27.282\,\mathrm{min}$, which helps to constrain the possible values of its mass ratio. TESS also helped to determine the superhump periods of one AM CVn star (ASASSN-19ct, $P_\mathrm{sh}=30.94\,\mathrm{min}$) and two cataclysmic variables we classify as WZ Sge stars ($P_\mathrm{sh}=90.77\,\mathrm{min}$ for ZTF18aaaasnn and $P_\mathrm{sh}=91.6\,\mathrm{min}$ for ASASSN-15na). We identified very different abundances in the spectra of the AM CVns binaries ASASSN-15kf and ASASSN-20pv (both $P_\mathrm{orb}\sim 27.5$ min), suggesting different type of donors. Six of the studied AM CVns are X-ray sources, which helped to determine their mass accretion rates. Photometry shows that the duration of all the superoutbursts detected in the AM CVns is consistent with expectations from the disc instability model. Finally, we provide refined criteria for the identification of new systems using all-sky surveys such as LSST.

## 25. Lord of the (sub-)Rings : Mapping the surface reflectance and spin-axis of Ajisai

**作者**: Robert J.S Airey, Paul Chote, James A. Blake, James McCormac, Billy Shrive, Don Pollacco, Benjamin F. Cooke

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16780.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16780.pdf)

**摘要**: Active debris removal techniques are posed to become an important tool in maintaining the safety of the near-Earth space environment. These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging. The Ajisai satellite provides an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating these techniques due to its simple geometry and well constrained spin behaviour. We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories.

## 26. Solar Cycle 25 Dynamics from Observational and Statistical Parameters: Characterization of the Maximum Phase and Rotational Behaviour

**作者**: Homer Dávila Gutiérrez

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16788.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16788.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a comprehensive analysis of Solar Cycle 25 aimed at precisely constraining the interval of its activity maximum using multiple observational parameters: sunspot number (SSN), Wolf number, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), the occurrence rate and speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the statistics of X-ray flares, and the reversal of the global magnetic field. A percentile-based classification of the adjusted F10.7 flux (EPH scale) is introduced, which allows us to identify the maximum-activity interval as August 2024 to January 2025. This period coincides with the reversal of the solar polar fields and is characterized by enhanced eruptive activity, including more than 190 M-class and 19 X-class flares (including an X6.3 flare on 10 December 2024) and multiple CMEs with speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. In the second part of the study we investigate solar rotation during this cycle using an independent observing campaign conducted in April 2025 in San Jose, Costa Rica, with privately owned telescopes in white light and in the H alpha line. Photometric techniques and active-region tracking yield mean synodic angular velocities of 12.8 +/- 2.8 deg/day in the northern hemisphere and 13.38 +/- 0.54 deg/day in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to sidereal periods of 22.78 and 21.77 days, respectively. Complementary SWPC-NOAA sunspot-region data provide synodic periods between 21.19 and 25.74 days, consistent with classical differential-rotation measurements. Linear velocities derived from SDO images span from about 872 km/h to more than 7400 km/h, depending on latitude and date.

## 27. In-depth analysis of the clustering of dark matter particles around primordial black holes. Part II. Analytical prescriptions for spikes

**作者**: Julien Lavalle, Pierre Salati

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16800.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16800.pdf)

**摘要**: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.

## 28. Gray Spectral Variability in Three Brown Dwarfs Observed by HST/WFC3 Time-Series Observations

**作者**: Madalyn F. Chapleski, Yifan Zhou

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16813.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16813.pdf)

**摘要**: The L/T transition is a critical evolutionary stage for brown dwarfs and self-luminous giant planets. L/T transition brown dwarfs are more likely to be spectroscopically variable, and their high-amplitude variability probes distributions in their clouds and chemical makeup. This paper presents Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectral time series data for three variable L/T transition brown dwarfs and compares the findings to the highly variable benchmark object 2MASS J2139. All four targets reveal significant brightness variability between 1.1 to 1.65 micron but show a difference in wavelength dependence of the variability amplitude. Three of our targets do not show significant decrease in variability amplitude in the 1.4 $\mu$m water absorption band commonly found in previous studies of L/T transition brown dwarfs. Additionally, at least two brown dwarfs have irregular-shaped, non-sinusoidal light curves. We create heterogeneous atmospheric models by linearly combining SONORA Diamondback model spectra, comparing them with the observations, and identifying the optimal effective temperature, cloud opacity, and cloud coverage for each object. Comparisons between the observed and model color-magnitude variations that trace both spectral windows and molecular features reveal that the early- T dwarfs likely possess heterogeneous clouds. The three T dwarfs show different trends in the same color-magnitude space which suggests secondary mechanisms driving their spectral variability. This work broadens the sample of L/T transition brown dwarfs that have detailed spectral time series analysis and offers new insights that can guide future atmospheric modeling efforts for both brown dwarfs and exoplanets.

## 29. Quantifying the impact of selection effects on FRB DM-$z$ relation cosmological inference

**作者**: Kritti Sharma, Vikram Ravi, Liam Connor, Elisabeth Krause, Pranjal R. S., Dhayaa Anbajagane

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16850.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16850.pdf)

**摘要**: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes of baryonic matter in the Universe, offering constraints on cosmological and feedback parameters through their extragalactic dispersion measure-redshift (DM$_\mathrm{exgal}$-$z$) relation. However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and population selection effects on cosmological inference derived from the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$. Using forward-modeled FRB population simulations, we explore progressively realistic survey scenarios incorporating redshift evolution, luminosity function, and instrument DM selection function. To enable rapid likelihood evaluations, we build a neural-network emulator for the variance in cosmic DM, $\sigma^2[\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{cosmic}}(z)]$, trained on $5\times10^4$ baryonification halo-model simulations, achieving $\leq4\%$ accuracy up to $z=4$. We demonstrate that while redshift and DM-dependent selection effects substantially alter the joint distribution $p(\mathrm{DM},z)$, they have a negligible impact on the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$ for current sample sizes. The parameter biases are $\lesssim0.8\sigma$ for $10^2$ FRBs, indicating that conditional analyses are robust for present surveys. However, depending on the survey DM-dependent search efficiency, these biases may exceed $3\sigma$ for $10^4$ FRBs, thus implying that explicit modeling of selection effects will be essential for next-generation samples.

## 30. Constructing Earth Formation History Using Deep Mantle Noble Gas Reservoirs

**作者**: Vincent Savignac, Eve J. Lee

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16859.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16859.pdf)

**摘要**: Noble gases are powerful probes of the Earth's early history, as they are chemically inert. Neon isotopic ratios in deep mantle plumes suggest that nebular gases were incorporated into the Earth's interior. This evidence implies the Earth's formation began when there was still gas around, with Earth embryos accreting primordial gas and a fraction of that gas dissolved into molten magma. In this work, we examine these implications, simulating the growth of primordial envelopes using modern gas accretion schemes, and computing the dissolution of nebular Ne into magma oceans following chemical equilibrium. We find that the embryo mass that reproduces the deep mantle concentration of primordial Ne is tightly constrained to $\sim 0.3 M_\oplus$, within a solar nebula depleted by $\geq 100 \times$ in gas density. Embryos of smaller masses cannot accrete enough gas to allow the mantle to reach the melting temperature of basalt. Embryos of larger masses accrete way too much gas, producing excessive Ne concentrations in the deep mantle. Based on our calculations, we suggest that the Earth's formation began with the assembly of $\sim 0.3 M_\oplus$ embryos during the dispersal of the solar nebula. Light noble gases (He, Ne) in the deep mantle reflect the primordial gas accretion history of the Earth, while heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) probe early solid accretion processes. Our results are consistent with the final assembly of the Earth through at least two giant impacts after the dispersal of the nebula.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16861.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16861.pdf)

**摘要**: Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.

## 32. Which active galaxies might be neutrino emitters?

**作者**: Shuying Zhou, Mouyuan Sun, Guobin Mou, Da-bin Lin, Tong Liu, Ming-Xuan Lu, Yongquan Xue

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16869.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16869.pdf)

**摘要**: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic.

## 33. Self-bound quark stars with a first-order two-to-three flavor phase transition

**作者**: G. Teruya, G. Lugones, A. G. Grunfeld

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16874.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16874.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate self-bound quark stars in a flavor-dependent quark-mass density-dependent (QMDD) model with an excluded-volume correction. We chart the parameter space at zero pressure to identify self-bound regimes, including cases with a first-order $ud \to uds$ transition, and construct cold, $\beta$-equilibrated stellar sequences via the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The excluded-volume parameter $\kappa$ controls the stiffness of the equation of state and thus masses, radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia. Intermediate repulsion typically reconciles $M_{\max} \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ with current radius/tidal constraints, with hybrid self-bound objects more compatible than pure strange-quark stars. We identify three EOS-insensitive trends $-$ dimensionless moment of inertia vs. compactness, tidal deformability vs. compactness, and gravitational vs. baryonic compactness $-$ whose explicit $\kappa$-dependence largely disappears in dimensionless form (the first two being notably tighter than the third). These results provide model-guided priors and tools for discriminating between hadronic and self-bound EOS families with multimessenger data.

## 34. Exploring Emission Line Variability and Jet-Broad Line Region Interaction in the Blazar TON 599

**作者**: Jonhatan U. Guerrero-González, Vahram Chavushyan, Víctor M. Patiño-Álvarez

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16891.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16891.pdf)

**摘要**: Blazars, a highly variable Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) subclass, provide a unique opportunity to explore the physical processes within their relativistic jets and emission regions. In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $\lambda$2798 Å emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($\lambda$3000 Å), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16892.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16892.pdf)

**摘要**: This study investigated the relation between the surface density of star formation rate (SFR) ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$), stellar mass ($\Sigma_{M_{\ast}}$), and molecular gas mass ($\Sigma_{M_\mathrm{mol}}$) on nearly 1 kpc scales averaged over concentric tilted rings using the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ mapping data of 92 nearby galaxies obtained in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) project. We categorized these galaxies into three groups based on the deviation of each global SFR from the star-forming main sequence (MS), $\Delta$MS: upper MS (UMS), MS, and lower MS (LMS). UMS galaxies tend to be less massive or barred spiral galaxies, exhibiting molecular gas fraction ($f_{\mathrm{gas}}$) comparable to those of MS galaxies but higher star formation efficiency (SFE). In contrast, the LMS galaxies tend to be massive or active galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Their $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ values are lower than those of MS galaxies, and their SFEs are slightly lower or comparable to those of MS galaxies in the inner region. These trends indicate that enhanced SFE contributes to higher $\Delta$MS values, whereas reduced $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ results in lower $\Delta$MS values. The less prominent bulge or the presence of a bar structure in UMS galaxies induces disk-wide star formation, consequently increasing the SFE. In LMS galaxies, the molecular gas is exhausted, and their star formation activity is low. Environmental effects, such as tidal gas stripping, may also reduce gas supply from the outer regions. Furthermore, our sample galaxies show that both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ decrease in the central region in LMS galaxies but did not change in the same region in UMS galaxies. These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain.

**摘要**: (abridged) After more than 10yr of ALMA operations, the community interest in conducting deep, extra-galactic, millimetre surveys resulted in varying strategic compromises between areal size and map depth to survey the sky. The current bias leans towards a galaxy population found in the field or towards rich star-bursty proto-cluster groups, both tendentiously surveyed at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z>1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15"-0.2" (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1"-2". The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms~2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from ~2E9 to ~9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/(this http URL), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments.

## 37. Exploring the Cosmological Model Degeneracy with a new evaluate factor G

**作者**: Yuan-bo Xie, Yun-dong Wu, Wei Hong, Tong-jie Zhang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16944.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16944.pdf)

**摘要**: In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.

## 38. Fully self-consistent nova explosion models reproducing light curves of KT Eri, V339 Del, V597 Pup, and SMC NOVA 2016-10a

**摘要**: The rising phase toward the optical maximum of a classical nova is one of the last frontiers of nova study. Constructing free-free emission model light curves based on our fully self-consistent nova explosion models, we present several theoretical light curves of classical novae and compare them with the four novae having the observed rising phase toward the optical maximum. Our 1.25 $M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) models show excellent agreements with the light curves of KT Eri, V339 Del, and V597 Pup while our 1.35 $M_\odot$ WD models are consistent with the light curves of SMC NOVA 2016-10a. These agreements indicate that the light curves toward the optical maximum of these novae are dominated by free-free emission, rather than by photospheric emission. Our results justify the previously obtained WD masses and distance moduli for these novae, and shows that the post-maximum evolution can be well approximated with the evolution sequences of steady-state envelope solutions.

## 39. Fast far-sidelobe modeling for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations

**作者**: Oliver Jeong, Jacques Delabrouille, Michel Piat

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16967.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16967.pdf)

**摘要**: Next-generation centimeter to sub-millimeter telescopes require exquisite control over instrumental far-sidelobe response to accurately measure faint signals like the Cosmic Microwave Background B modes. Because existing electromagnetic modeling methods are computationally expensive, we developed a novel, diffraction-based beam modeling method for rapid and low-cost calculations. We applied this methodology to model the BICEP3 far-sidelobes and found good qualitative agreement with in situ beam measurements. Using this validated simulated beam, we calculated the sidelobe temperature pickup for a specific observation scenario: scanning near the slopes of Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert. This rapid, predictive framework is most valuable as a tool for optimizing instrument baffling and identifying efficient scan strategies during the conceptual design phase.

## 40. A novel double-rim forebaffle design for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations

**作者**: Jacques Delabrouille, Oliver Jeong, Michel Piat, Alexander Steier

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16970.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16970.pdf)

**摘要**: Stray radiation of various origin is a major source of degradation of centimeter to sub-millimeter astronomical observations. This is particularly problematic for the detection of signals such as faint cosmic microwave background polarization B modes, or for mapping large-scale extragalactic or Galactic diffuse emission. In this paper, we propose a double-rim forebaffle design to reduce the impact of such stray radiation contamination. Using qualitative arguments and numerical simulations, we show that such a design has the potential to substantially improve the quality of future observations.

## 41. Probing Dark Matter Substructure with Image Number Anomaly in Strong Lensing Systems

**作者**: Wenlin Hou, Jianxiang Liu, Kai Liao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16971.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16971.pdf)

**摘要**: Gravitational lensing observables, including anomalies in image positions, flux ratios, and time delays, serve as usual probes of dark matter (DM) substructure. When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\lesssim 0.125\%$, $0.08\%$, and $0.04\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \times 10^{-22} \ \mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\lesssim 0.9\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure.

## 42. TRAO Survey of the Nearby Filamentary Molecular Clouds, the Universal Nursery of Stars (TRAO-FUNS). IV. Filaments and Dense Cores in the W40 and Serpens South Regions of Aquila

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16978.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16978.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the results of molecular line observations toward the W40 and Serpens South regions of the Aquila molecular cloud complex, conducted as part of the TRAO-FUNS project to investigate the role of filamentary structures in the formation of dense cores and stars in molecular clouds. We performed a Gaussian decomposition of the C$^{18}$O spectra to disentangle multiple velocity components along the line-of-sight and a `Friends-of-Friends' algorithm on these decomposed components to identify 24 velocity-coherent filaments in the observed region. The `FellWalker' algorithm is applied on the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ integrated intensity map to identify the dense cores embedded within the filaments. Many of the filaments previously identified from the Herschel survey are found to contain multiple velocity-coherent filaments. Virial analysis indicated that all of our identified filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound. Velocity gradients are observed along the filaments in the vicinity of embedded dense cores, indicating the presence of longitudinal flows that contribute to core formation. The median mass flow rate across the observed region is estimated to be $\sim$35 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with Serpens South showing a rate $\sim$40\% higher than W40. The analysis of non-thermal motions revealed that the dense cores mainly show subsonic to transonic motions, while their host filaments are mostly supersonic, suggesting that the turbulent motions in filaments may dissipate on smaller scales, allowing core formation. These findings highlight the essential role of the filaments' criticality, mass flow, and turbulent dissipation in the formation of dense cores within the filaments.

**摘要**: The Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) project is a multi-facility programme exploring how dense environments transform galaxies. Combining a VLT/MUSE P110 Large Programme and ALMA observations of 40 late-type Virgo Cluster galaxies, MAUVE resolves star formation, kinematics, and chemical enrichment within their molecular gas discs. A key goal is to track the evolution of cold gas that survives in the inner regions of satellites after entering the cluster, and how it evolves across different infall stages. With its high spatial resolution -- probing down to the physical scales of giant molecular cloud complexes -- and multiphase synergy, MAUVE aims to offer a time-resolved view of environmental quenching and set a new benchmark for cluster galaxy studies.

## 44. Comparing galaxy merger orbits in hydrodynamical simulation and in dark-matter-only simulation

**作者**: Yahan Pu, Lan Wang, Guangquan Zeng, Lizhi Xie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17060.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17060.pdf)

**摘要**: To investigate how the presence of baryons in simulations affects galaxy merger orbits, we compare in detail the merger timescales and orbits of the matched merger pairs in TNG100 hydrodynamical simulations and their corresponding dark-matter-only simulations, for different resolution levels. Compared with the mergers in the TNG100-1-Dark simulation without baryons, the matched mergers in the TNG100-1 simulation have similar infall time, but have statistically earlier merger times and therefore shorter merger timescales. The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation. In the final 2 Gyr before merger, the collision angles that represent merger orbits quantitatively are smaller in TNG100-1 than those in TNG100-1-Dark, by around 6$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$, depending on the mass ratios and galaxy masses investigated. Our results demonstrate that the presence of baryons accelerates a bit the merger processes, and results in more spiral-in orbits for both major and minor mergers in galaxies with various stellar masses. These effects are less obvious in simulations with lower resolutions.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17061.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17061.pdf)

**摘要**: With the exponential growth of astronomical data over time, finding the needles in the haystack is becoming increasingly difficult. The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves. As a step in this direction, we have implemented morphological image similarity search into the ALMA Science Archive (ASA). To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer. This is the first time image similarity search has been offered in an astronomical science archive.

## 46. Spectral synthesis techniques for supernovae and kilonovae

**作者**: Anders Jerkstrand

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17084.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17084.pdf)

**摘要**: Supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae (KNe) are the most violent explosions in cosmos, signalling the destruction of a massive star (core-collapse SN), a white dwarf (thermonuclear SN) and a neutron star (KN), respectively. The ejected debris in these explosions is believed to be the main cosmic source of most elements in the periodic table. However, decoding the spectra of these transients is a challenging task requiring sophisticated spectral synthesis modelling. Here, the techniques for such modelling is reviewed, with particular focus on the computational aspects. We build from a historical review of how methodologies evolved from modelling of stellar winds, to supernovae, to kilonovae, studying various approximations in use for the central physical processes. Similarities and differences in the numeric schemes employed by current codes are discussed, and the path towards improved models is laid out.

## 47. RUBIX: Differentiable forward modelling of galaxy spectral data cubes for gradient-based parameter estimation

**作者**: Anna Lena Schaible, Ufuk Çakır, Tobias Buck, Harald Mack, Aura Obreja, Nihat Oguz, William H. Oliver, Horea-Alexandru Cărămizaru

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17110.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17110.pdf)

**摘要**: Although integral-field spectroscopy enables spatially resolved spectral studies of galaxies, bridging particle-based simulations to observations remains slow and non-differentiable. We present RUBIX, a JAX-based pipeline that models mock integral-field unit (IFU) cubes for galaxies end-to-end and calculates gradients with respect to particle inputs. Our implementation is purely functional, sharded, and differentiable throughout. We validate the gradients against central finite differences and demonstrate gradient-based parameter estimation on controlled setups. While current experiments are limited to basic test cases, they demonstrate the feasibility of differentiable forward modelling of IFU data. This paves the way for future work scaling up to realistic galaxy cubes and enabling machine learning workflows for IFU-based inference. The source code for the RUBIX software is publicly available under this https URL.

## 48. Dark Matter Admixed White Dwarfs: A Single-Fluid Approach

**作者**: Rajasmita Sahoo, Somnath Mukhopadhyay, Mrutunjaya Bhuyan

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17120.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17120.pdf)

**摘要**: In this study, we investigate the influence of an admixed fermionic dark matter (DM) component on the equilibrium structure of white dwarfs (WDs), with particular emphasis on the effects of varying the DM particle mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and DM fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$). Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.

## 49. RGB Tip distance to the faint gas-rich dwarf KK 153

**作者**: M. Bellazzini, G. Beccari, R. Pascale, D. Paris, F. Annibali, F. Cusano, D. Pérez-Millán

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17132.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17132.pdf)

**摘要**: KK 153 is a star-forming dwarf galaxy that has been recently proposed as a new member of the sparsely populated class of gas-rich ultra faint dwarfs, lying in the outskirts of the Local Group. We used the Large Binocular Telescope under sub-arcsec seeing conditions to resolve for the first time the outer regions of KK 153 into individual stars, reaching the red giant branch. The magnitude of the red giant branch tip was used to measure a distance of D=3.06 (+0.17/-0.14) Mpc, much more accurate and precise than the estimate previously available in the literature, based on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (D=2.0 (+1.7/-0.8) Mpc). The new distance places KK 153 clearly beyond the boundaries of the Local Group, and, together with a new measure of the integrated magnitude, implies a stellar mass of M_*=2.4 \pm 0.2 X 10^6 M_{\sun}. The dwarf populates the extreme low-mass tail of the M_* distribution of gas-rich galaxies but it is significantly more massive than the faintest local gas-rich dwarfs, Leo T and Leo P. In analogy with similar systems, the star formation history of KK 153 may have been impacted by the re-ionisation of the Universe while keeping a sufficient gas reservoir to form new stars several Gyr later.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17137.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17137.pdf)

**摘要**: Relativistic accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is one of the most efficient known mechanisms for converting gravitational potential energy into radiation. In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.

## 51. From Ground to Space: An Overview of the JEM-EUSO Program for the Study of UHECRs and Astrophysical Neutrinos

**作者**: Zbigniew Plebaniak

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17139.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17139.pdf)

**摘要**: The JEM-EUSO (Joint Exploratory Missions for Extreme Universe Space Observatory) collaboration is an international initiative studying ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and related phenomena. These particles, with energies exceeding 10$^{20}$~eV, provide insights into extreme astrophysical processes but remain challenging to detect due to their low flux. At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements. Future efforts include the POEMMA space mission, designed for stereoscopic observations of UHECRs and multi-messenger phenomena, the PBR experiment, which integrates radio detection and is scheduled to fly in 2027, and the M-EUSO satellite mission, proposed to ESA.

**摘要**: Arp@VST is a public observing programme, conducted at the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) hosted at ESO's Paranal Observatory. It aims to revisit the Arp catalogue by creating a public survey. The Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies was produced by Halton Arp in 1966 and contains 338 galaxies with distorted morphologies and/or interacting systems. Given the excellent capabilities of the VST to map the galaxies' structure down to low surface brightness levels, for this project we will acquire deep, multi-band (g, r, i, H{\alpha}) images for all the Arp galaxies visible from Paranal Observatory (Declination < +10 deg). Being a public survey, the reduced data will be released via the ESO Science Archive as soon as they are processed.

**摘要**: We present the results of a STAROS monitoring campaign on the bright eclipsing binary star alpha Draconis. Over 200 high-resolution spectra were obtained by an international group of amateur astronomers. We were able to calculate an homogeneously covered radial velocity curve and redetermine the orbital elements of the alpha Draconis system. From the data set, we estimated the quality of our observations and accuracy of our radial velocity measurements. Finally, we have also implemented a spectral disentangling method to search for the signature of a companion star and used atmosphere models to constrain the atmospheric parameters of the system.

## 54. Constraining non-minimally coupled squared-Quartic Hilltop Inflation in light of ACT observations

**作者**: Jureeporn Yuennan, Farruh Atamurotov, Phongpichit Channuie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17216.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17216.pdf)

**摘要**: The combination of the data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with the recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate that the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) has a larger value than the Planck 2018 which leads to tension within standard inflationary models. In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck--ACT--DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds. The associated energy scale of inflation, \( V_0^{1/4} \sim 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2} M_p \), remains compatible with high-scale inflationary scenarios.

## 55. An Alternative Explanation for the Helium Star Pulsar Binary J1928$+$1815: The Most Heavyweight Black Widow System to Date

**作者**: Hang Gong, Alexey Bobrick, Francisco Garzón, Deven Bhakta, Thomas Maccarone, Sangita Kumari, Nieves Castro Rodríguez, Antonio Cabrera-Lavers, Arash Bahramian, Jifeng Liu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17248.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17248.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the results of deep near-infrared imaging of the recently discovered helium star pulsar binary J1928$+$1815 situated in the Galactic plane. Our observations did not achieve significant detections, providing limiting magnitudes of J=23.7 and H=22.2, which are both 2.4\,magnitudes deeper than the expected J and H magnitudes for a modeled stripped helium star with a mass of 1\,$\rm M_{\odot}$ after extinction. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints.

## 56. Far-infrared to centimeter emission of very nearby galaxies with archival data

**作者**: L.Correia, C. Bot, J. Chastenet, A.Rymar, R.Paladini, M. Bethermin, D. Ismail, K.A.Lutz, J.-P. Bernard, A.Hughes, D. Paradis, N. Ysard

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17268.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17268.pdf)

**摘要**: Compared to the well-studied infrared and radio domains, galaxy emission in the millimeter (mm) - centimeter (cm) range has been less observed. In this domain, galaxy emission consists of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron emissions with a possible additional contribution from anomalous microwave emission (AME) peaking near 1 this http URL aim of this study is to accurately characterize the integrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies in the mm-cm range. We used COBE-DIRBE, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP all-sky surveys, brought to the same resolution of $1^\circ$, to cover 18 photometric bands from 97$\mu$m to 1.3 cm. Given the low angular resolution and mixing with foreground and background emission that hampers the detection of the galaxy, our sample consists of 6 of the brightest, nearby galaxies: LMC, SMC, M31, M33, NGC 253 and NGC 4945. We subtract Milky Way dust emission, distant unresolved galaxies, and foreground point sources in the fields. We fit each integrated SED with a model of thermal dust, free-free, synchrotron, AME and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The integrated SEDs of our sample of galaxies are well fitted by the model within the uncertainties, although degeneracies between the different components contributing to the mm-cm emission complicate the estimation of their individual contributions. We do not clearly detect AME in any of our target galaxies, and AME emissivity upper limits are weak compared to Galactic standards, suggesting that the signal of AME might be diluted at the scale of a whole galaxy. We infer positive CMB fluctuations in the background of 5 out of our 6 galaxies. This effect might be related to the degeneracy between the dust emissivity index and CMB fluctuations in the background, or linked to the specific spatial distribution of CMB fluctuations coupled with the low resolution and small number statistics.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17285.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17285.pdf)

**摘要**: We present an analysis of the covariance spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its hard state. For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.

**摘要**: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.

**摘要**: We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.

## 60. On the baryon budget in the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass galaxies

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17313.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17313.pdf)

**摘要**: Recent observations with SRG/eROSITA have revealed the average X-ray surface brightness profile of the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, offering valuable insights into the baryon mass in these systems. However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.

## 61. Effect of the Memory Burden on Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots

**作者**: Nathaniel Levy, Lucien Heurtier

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17329.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17329.pdf)

**摘要**: When primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate, they deposit energy in the surrounding plasma, leading to temperature gradients, or hot spots, that evolve during the evaporation process. Motivated by recent studies suggesting that a memory burden may slow down PBH evaporation, we explore how a suppression of the evaporation rate affects the morphology of such hot spots. We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered. Nonetheless, we show that alternative scenarios may lead to sizeable hot spots with morphologies that differ significantly from the semi-classical case.

**摘要**: Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers -- in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.

## 63. A XRISM View of Relativistic Reflection in Cygnus X-1

**作者**: Paul A. Draghis, Jon M. Miller, Erin Kara, Elisa Costantini, Oluwashina Adegoke, Javier A. Garcia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17338.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17338.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the first high-resolution XRISM/Resolve view of the relativistically broadened Fe K line in Cygnus X-1. The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\theta\simeq63^\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1. These results highlight the unique abilities of XRISM in separating overlapping spectral features and providing constraints on the geometry of accretion in X-ray binaries.

## 64. Deep Learning Analysis of Ions Accelerated at Shocks

**作者**: Paxson Swierc, Damiano Caprioli, Luca Orusa, Miha Cernetic

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17363.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17363.pdf)

**摘要**: We study the application of deep learning techniques to the analysis and classification of ions accelerated at collisionless shocks in hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations. Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (>90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations. This study shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from kinetic plasma simulations and sets the groundwork for future applications, including the construction of sub-grid models in fluid approaches.

## 65. Discovering periodic and repeating nuclear transients in the XMM-Newton archives

**作者**: Natalie A. Webb, Vincent Foustoul, Robbie Webbe, Matteo Bachetti, Erwan Quintin, Laurent Michel

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17385.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17385.pdf)

**摘要**: The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.

## 66. Accelerating the CLEAN algorithm of radio interferometry with convex optimization

**作者**: Hendrik Müller, Mingyu Hsieh, Sanjay Bhatnagar

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17410.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17410.pdf)

**摘要**: In radio-interferometry, we recover an image from an incompletely sampled Fourier data. The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two this http URL remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended.

## 67. Quasar clustering and duty cycle measurements at $0\leq z\leq 4$ with the Gaia-unWISE Catalog

**作者**: Mariona Giner Mascarell, Anna-Christina Eilers, Kate Storey-Fisher

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17413.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17413.pdf)

**摘要**: We measure the two-point correlation function of a uniformly selected, all-sky sample of $\sim$1.3 million quasars with magnitudes $G\leq20.5$ from the Gaia--unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia) over the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 4$ to trace the evolution of the quasar clustering strength across cosmic time. We find a steady increase in the correlation length $r_0$ with redshift, i.e. $r_0 = 6.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $0 \leq z < 1$, $r_0=8.0 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $1 \leq z < 2$, $r_0=10.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $2 \leq z < 3$, and $r_0=13.9 \pm 1.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $3 \leq z < 4$, and slopes consistent with $\gamma \approx 2$. Our measurements suggest a slightly weaker clustering signal at $z>3$ than previous studies, and thus we find a smooth, monotonic rise in clustering strength. Using a bias-halo mass relation and a step-function for the halo occupation distribution, we infer characteristic minimum halo masses of quasar hosts of $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{min}}/M_\odot) \approx 12.8$ across all redshifts. Combining these with the observed quasar number densities yields duty cycles that rise from $f_{\mathrm{duty}} \approx 2\%$ to $\approx 7\%$ with increasing redshift, corresponding to integrated quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm QSO}\sim10^8$~years. These results suggest that both the characteristic halo mass of active quasars and their typical lifetimes have remained remarkably stable over more than $12 \sim$ Gyr of cosmic time, implying a self-regulated growth process largely independent of epoch.

## 68. Moving superfluids in the rotating universe

**作者**: Jose Beltrán Jiménez, Federico Piazza, Javier Vecino

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17472.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17472.pdf)

**摘要**: We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion. In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected.

**作者**: Brianna Peck, Jessica R. Lu, Lianqi Wang, Brooke DiGia, Richard Dekany, Antonin H. Bouchez, Peter Wizinowich, Maxwell A. Millar-Blanchaer, Mark Chun, Philip Hinz, Charles-Antoine Claveau

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17488.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17488.pdf)

**摘要**: We present performance simulations for a proposed visible-light, multi-conjugate adaptive optics system for the 10-meter W. M. Keck I telescope that aims to deliver near diffraction-limited angular resolution at optical wavelengths. Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis. More work is needed to explore alternative LGS/TTNGS asterisms, optimize conjugation heights for high-altitude deformable mirrors, and test performance under poorer seeing conditions.

**摘要**: Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are star-forming galaxies with significant Ly$\alpha$ emission and are often used as tracers of large-scale structure at high redshift. We explore the relationship between the Ly$\alpha$ line profile and environmental density with spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) of LAEs selected with narrow-band photometry through the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. We use LAE surface density maps in the N419 (z $\sim$ 2.45) and N501 (z $\sim$ 3.12) narrow bands to probe the relationship between local environmental density and the Ly$\alpha$ line profile. In both narrow bands, we stack the LAE spectra in bins of environmental density and inside and outside of protocluster regions. The N501 data shows $\sim$15% higher Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect. The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity.

**摘要**: The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.

## 72. Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension

**作者**: Luca Brunelli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16725.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16725.pdf)

**摘要**: A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.

## 73. WIMP Meets ALP: Coherent Freeze-Out of Dark Matter

**作者**: Steven Ferrante, Maxim Perelstein, Bingrong Yu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16731.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16731.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the cosmological history of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) coupled to a light axion-like particle (ALP) via a quadratic coupling. Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an "ALP miracle": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass.

## 75. Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation

**作者**: Johor D. Peñalba Quispitupa, Guillermo F. Quispe Peña, Jose T. Galvez Ghersi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16801.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16801.pdf)

**摘要**: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.

## 76. Accelerating parameter estimation for parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave observations

**作者**: Dhruv Kumar, Ish Gupta, Bangalore Sathyaprakash

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16879.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16879.pdf)

**摘要**: Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.

## 77. Exceptional line and pseudospectrum in black hole spectroscopy

**作者**: Li-Ming Cao, Ming-Fei Ji, Liang-Bi Wu, Yu-Sen Zhou

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17067.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.

**摘要**: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.

## 79. Cosmological perturbations on an averaged background

**作者**: Marco Galoppo, Pierre Mourier

**摘要**: In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.

## 80. A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background

**作者**: Hannah Duval, Charles Badger, Mairi Sakellariadou

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17422.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17422.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own.

## 81. Constraining tachyonic inflationary β-exponential model with Continuous Spontaneous Localization collapse scheme

**作者**: F. A. Brito, Julio C. M. Rocha, A. S. Lemos, A. S. Pereira

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12351.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12351.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we consider the dynamics of the self-induced collapse of the tachyon wave function in inflationary scenarios. We analyze the modifications on the power spectrum by considering the $\beta$-exponential potential, whose parameters have updated constraints by the Planck 2018 baseline data and recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Moreover, we show that for this kind of potential, just for a narrow range of $\beta$-parameter, there is agreement between the theoretical predictions and the current observational data. Considering the proposal for a collapse scheme that leads to the modification of Schrödinger evolution of the inflation wave function from the employment of a Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) approach, we derive the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. We then obtained the constraints on both collapse and $\beta$-parameters that, in turn, yield deviations in the $n_{s}$ vs. $r$ plane when compared to the $\beta$-exponential potential standard estimate. The CSL scheme applied to tachyonic inflation driven by a $\beta$-potential offers an adequate description of the recent data.

**摘要**: Measuring the growth rate of large-scale structures (f) as a function of redshift has the potential to break degeneracies between modified gravity and dark energy models, when combined with expansion-rate probes. Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have attracted interest as a means of estimating $f\sigma_8$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with a unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for a nonlinear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We have developed a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of $f\sigma_8$. We derived a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also included the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compared their performance against ours, and we validated our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we performed have allowed us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage to be used in our calculations than in previous works. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the $f\sigma_8$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 % closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.

## 83. Proto-neutron star oscillations including accretion flows

**作者**: Dimitra Tseneklidou, Raimon Luna, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Alejandro Torres-Forné

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16317.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16317.pdf)

**摘要**: The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillation modes of a PNS in general relativity, including, for the first time, the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.

## 84. The contribution of turbulent AGN coronae to the diffuse neutrino flux

**作者**: Damiano F. G. Fiorillo, Luca Comisso, Enrico Peretti, Maria Petropoulou, Lorenzo Sironi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06336.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06336.pdf)

**摘要**: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can accelerate protons to energies of $\sim$10-100 TeV, with secondary production of high-energy neutrinos. If the acceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the resulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown that these properties are consistent with the TeV neutrino signal observed from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a population study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the energetics of the corona - the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and non-thermal proton energy - and on the spectral energy distribution of the AGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from the candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less significant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino signal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict the diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it can account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the $\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.

## 85. The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 -- I. Presentation of the Data and Detailed Exploration of the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Scenario

**摘要**: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\beta$ emission line. The line profile also becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. Alongside the spectroscopic analyses, we examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. Of these, we disfavor all but the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios. As the binary explanation is the only one testable with current data, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability, and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian orbit model. Within the binary framework, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. Thus, the fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further testing. Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate the credentials of this quasar.

**摘要**: We present the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.

## 87. Did the Corona Borealis-A2142 supercluster binary-like system originate as a proto-cluster binary embedded in a primordial cloud of galaxies?

**作者**: Giovanni C. Baiesi Pillastrini

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13240.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13240.pdf)

**摘要**: The formation of the giant binary-like system composed by the Corona Borealis and Abell 2142 superclusters is an intriguing conundrum of the formation of large scale structures since, from the observational point of view, it represents a rare peculiarity in the distribution of massive galaxy superclusters. Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course, after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142 system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with observations.

## 88. A systematic search for AGN obscuration variability in the Chandra archive

**作者**: Isaiah S. Cox, Núria Torres-Albà, Stefano Marchesi, Vittoria E. Gianolli, Xiurui Zhao, Marco Ajello, Indrani Pal, Ross Silver

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04457.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04457.pdf)

**摘要**: The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we study 79 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies from the Milliquas catalog to estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z<0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations. We find that 43 sources $(54\pm11\%)$, show indications of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability at 90% confidence level. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 $(f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}\%)$ and Seyfert 2 $(f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15\%)$ galaxies. The slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$ fraction could be due to either a physical difference in the obscurers or the higher data quality in the Sy1 population. We also search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales. We present the 43 variable sources as a promising sample for future $N_{\rm H}$ variability studies.

## 89. The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST

**作者**: Pratika Dayal, Roberto maiolino

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08116.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08116.pdf)

**摘要**: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

## 90. $w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations

**作者**: Dorian Araya, Cristian Castillo, Genly Leon, Juan Magaña, Angie Barr Domínguez, Miguel A. García-Aspeitia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09281.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09281.pdf)

**摘要**: We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$), considering both flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H>0$, while contraction is linked to $H < 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical due to density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows for shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.

## 91. Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts

**作者**: Surajit Kalita, Akhil Uniyal, Tomasz Bulik, Yosuke Mizuno

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14947.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14947.pdf)

**摘要**: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$ when using separate priors on baryon density parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ or $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2$, indicating contradiction to the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when the priors are combined, this redshift dependence disappears, yielding a consistent estimate of $H_0$. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model even without combining the priors. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.

## 92. Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets

**作者**: Slava G. Turyshev

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20236.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20236.pdf)

**摘要**: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR >= 5 per micro-pixel. We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals -- exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization -- each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular-resolution and photon-budget thresholds to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to <= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits -- but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens -- providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches heliocentric distances beyond >= 550 AU -- is uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. Once mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired, the SGL enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.

## 93. Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies

**作者**: Ashish Kumar Meena, Prasenjit Saha

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20305.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20305.pdf)

**摘要**: Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.

## 94. Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region

**作者**: Eugene Churazov, Lawrence Rudnick, Ildar Khabibullin, Marisa Brienza, Alex Schekochihin, Dmitri Uzdensky

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20780.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20780.pdf)

**摘要**: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfvén speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfvén or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.

## 95. Stable Collisionless Tori Around Kerr Black Holes

**作者**: Martin Luepker, Yajie Yuan, Alexander Y. Chen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09077.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09077.pdf)

**摘要**: In low-luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87$^\ast$ and Sgr A$^\ast$, the accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole is in the collisionless regime, meaning that the collisional mean free path of charged particles is much larger than the dynamical length scales. To properly model the particle energization and emission from the collisionless accretion flow, a promising approach is to employ the global general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations$\unicode{x2014}$a newly developed, fully kinetic, first-principles method. However, it has been challenging to set up an initial condition that involves collisionless gas with finite angular momentum. We present, for the first time, a class of analytic kinetic equilibria of collisionless tori around a Kerr black hole. We have successfully implemented the collisionless tori in our GPU-based GRPIC code framework Aperture, and found them to be stable for hundreds to thousands of dynamical times in 2D axisymmetric simulations when there is no initial seed magnetic field. These kinetic equilibria serve as ideal starting points for future studies of the physics of collisionless accretion and jet launching.

## 96. The resummation model in FLAMINGO: precisely predicting matter power suppression from observed halo baryon fractions

**作者**: Marcel P. van Daalen, Ioannis Koutalios, Jeger C. Broxterman, Bart J.H. Wolfs, John C. Helly, Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04552.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04552.pdf)

**摘要**: In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level accuracy. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We calibrate this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical accuracy of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ accuracy. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ accurate suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy. This relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level accuracy, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.

**摘要**: The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

## 98. Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22843.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22843.pdf)

**摘要**: GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.

## 99. LATIS Data Release: $\sim4200$ Spectra of $z \sim 2-3$ Galaxies, Redshifts, and Intergalactic Medium Tomography Maps

**作者**: Andrew B. Newman, Gwen C. Rudie, Guillermo A. Blanc, Daniel D. Kelson, Nima Chartab, Enrico Congiu, Victoria Pérez, Mahdi Qezlou, Simeon Bird, Brian C. Lemaux, Olga Cucciati

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08815.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08815.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies. The survey provides 7408 optical spectra of candidate $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies and QSOs in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey D1, D2 (COSMOS), and D4 fields. The $R \sim 1000$ spectra were obtained using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) at the Magellan Baade telescope, with typical integrations of 12 hr. From these spectra, we measured 5575 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts, of which 4176 are at $z > 1.7$, thereby substantially increasing the number of public spectroscopic redshifts at $z \approx 2-3$ in COSMOS and the other survey fields. The data release includes Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations measured in $4.7 \times 10^5$ pixels, which were used to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission spanning 1.65 deg$^2$ and $z = 2.2-2.8$ at a resolution of 4 $h^{-1}$ cMpc. These are the largest such maps to date and provide a novel tracer of large-scale structure in legacy fields. We also provide ancillary data, including mock surveys. The LATIS data will enable a variety of community studies of galaxy evolution, environments, and the IGM around cosmic noon.

## 100. PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers

**作者**: Charlotte Smith-Perez, Aidan Hembruff, Els Peeters, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Alessandra Ricca

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09972.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09972.pdf)

**摘要**: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.

## 101. Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)

**作者**: Noam Soker, Kobi Shiran

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18782.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18782.pdf)

**摘要**: Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify two (possibly three) evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to two (or three) ejecta shells. We find that several CCSN remnants have morphologies with two or more complete or partial shells, compatible with the presence of two (or three) photospheric shells during the photospheric phase of the explosion. Studies have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

## 102. Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates

**作者**: Nobuya Nishimura, Carla Froehlich, Thomas Rauscher

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01859.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01859.pdf)

**摘要**: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

## 103. Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating

**作者**: Peter Adshead, Eve Currens, John T. Giblin Jr

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02059.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02059.pdf)

**摘要**: We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.

## 104. Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae

**作者**: Said Laaroua

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06755.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06755.pdf)

**摘要**: We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant. Using 1,543 unique SNe with heliocentric and CMB-frame redshifts, we detect statistically significant but physically small residuals: a monopole offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL}\rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}$ and a kinematic dipole with amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-3}$ aligned to within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through the full Pantheon+ STAT+SYS covariance matrix, these residuals shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$, corresponding to about $1%$ of the present $5$--$6~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$ Hubble tension. This shows that redshift-frame inconsistencies in Pantheon+ cannot contribute more than a percent-level fraction of the $H_0$ discrepancy. We therefore rule out a class of proposed explanations attributing the Hubble tension to SN redshift-frame errors.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf)

**摘要**: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.

## 106. Reheating and Inflationary dynamics driven by an inverse tangent potential

**作者**: Mayur Abhisheki, Prasanta Kumar Das

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13045.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13045.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we study the early universe inflation and the post-inflation reheating era employing an inverse tangent potential of the form $V=V_0 \cdot[tan^{-1}(\frac{\kappa \phi}{m_p})]^2$, where $\kappa$ is a free parameter of the potential and $m_p$ is the reduced Planck mass. We derive the slow roll parameters, the number of e-folds(N), the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the tensor spectral index $n_T$ for the inverse tangent potential. We examine the inflationary observables using the data of the Planck-2018 and recent ACT collaboration and obtain constraints on the potential parameter $\kappa$. We also employ a reheating analysis by invoking the conservation of entropy between today and the time when reheating starts. We obtain bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the number of e-folds of the reheating $N_{re}$ using the spectral-index $n_s$ constraints from Planck 2018 and the ACT results. We show that this inverse-tangent potential can act as an alternative to the standard inflationary potentials like Starobinsky which are excluded at $2\sigma$ level by the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration.

## 107. Deep-learning mitigation of foregrounds and beam effects in 21-cm intensity mapping using hybrid frequency differencing and PCA

**作者**: Zitong Wang, Feng Shi, Le Zhang, Yanming Liu, Xiaoping Li, Shulei Ni, Ming Jiang, Xiaofan Ma

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15072.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15072.pdf)

**摘要**: 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) is a powerful technique to probe the large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) and extract cosmological information such as the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. A key challenge lies in recovering the faint HI signal from bright foregrounds and frequency-dependent beam effects, which can compromise traditional cleaning methods like principal component analysis (PCA) by removing part of the cosmological signal. Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work~\citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k<0.1 h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys.

## 108. Iron Nuclei in Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays Near the Earth

**作者**: A. Uryson

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15776.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15776.pdf)

**摘要**: The propagation of cosmic iron nuclei with energies above 10^19 eV from their sources to the Galaxy is discussed by assuming that cosmic rays at ultra-high energies are of extragalactic origin. In extragalactic space, cosmic nuclei interact with background emissions and inevitably fragment. An analysis is performed of the fraction of iron nuclei reaching the Earth and how its energy depends on the distance from cosmic ray sources. It is found that energies of iron nuclei can be used to determine restriction on the distances from their sources

## 109. The MeerKAT Fornax Survey VI. The collapse of the galaxy HI Mass Function in Fornax

**作者**: D. Kleiner, P. Serra, A. Loni, S. H. A. Rajohnson, F. M. Maccagni, W. J. G. de Blok, P. Kamphuis, R. C. Kraan-Korteweg, M. A. W. Verheijen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15795.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15795.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the deepest HI mass Function (HIMF) ever measured, outside the Local Group. The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$\sigma$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 < log(MHI/Msun) < 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) > 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $\alpha$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.

## 110. Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16824.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16824.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. These structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around (30 - 40, R_sun) and decreasing farther out. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta (beta <= 1) environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 R_sun), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfvénic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures, unlike most near-Sun solar wind fluctuations, exhibit sunward-directed Alfvénic polarization in the plasma frame. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfvénic solar wind. While these structures might be Alfvénic solitons, vortices, or flux ropes, we refrain from a definitive classification pending further evidence. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.

## 111. The early universe is $\textit{ACT}$-ing $\textit{warm}$

**作者**: Arjun Berera, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Zizang Qiu, Rudnei O. Ramos, Gabriel S. Rodrigues

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02655.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02655.pdf)

**摘要**: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms. The model analyzed here has mirror and $Z_4$ symmetries, which explicitly protect the inflaton potential from large quantum and thermal corrections. We use a recent precision numerical code designed for warm inflationary perturbations, improving on the determination of the cosmological observables previously obtained for such models.

## 112. Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM

**作者**: Simran Arora, Antonio De Felice, Shinji Mukohyama

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03784.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03784.pdf)

**摘要**: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.

## 113. Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems

**作者**: Marta Cocco, Gianluca Grignani, Troels Harmark, Marta Orselli, Davide Panella, Daniele Pica

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24897.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24897.pdf)

**摘要**: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. We find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprints distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.

## 114. Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?

**作者**: Zhi-zhong Xing

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15127.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15127.pdf)

**摘要**: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.
