**摘要**: The electroproduction of $\eta '$ mesons from a $\mathrm{^{1}H}$ target at $W=2.13~\text{GeV}$, $Q^{2} = 0.46~\left( \text{GeV}/c\right)^{2}$ and $\cos \theta^{\text{CM}}_{\gamma^{*}\eta'} \approx -1$ has been experimentally measured. The differential cross section of virtual-photoproduction has been obtained as $4.4 \pm 0.8 ~\left( \text{stat.} \right) \pm 0.4 ~\left( \text{sys.} \right)~ \text{nb/sr}$ in the One-Photon-Exchange Approximation. This value is one-sixth of that of real-photoproduction at backward angles. A comparison with newly-developed isobar model calculations not only shows validity of the theoretical framewark employed, but also imposes new constrains on coupling strength between the $\eta'p$ final state and nucleon resonances.

**摘要**: Our understanding of the weak mixing of quarks, described by the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix, currently presents an anomaly. Thanks to major strides in both theory and experiment, improved precision in determinations of the first row of matrix elements has revealed disagreement with the expectation of unitarity. The Nab experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source is designed to precisely extract the first matrix element $V_{ud}$ and shed light on experimental tensions within the neutron beta decay dataset. Nab's asymmetric spectrometer allows coincident reconstruction of the decay proton and electron energies, which will be used to determine the electron-neutrino correlation coefficient, and thus (with the neutron lifetime) determine $V_{ud}$. This unique approach has provided a more comprehensive view of neutron beta decay, including a first observation of the full momentum phase space of the decay above detector thresholds and limits on exotic neutron states. Recent upgrades to the Nab detector system have improved the robustness and stability of the detector performance in terms of proton detection efficiency, noise performance, and detector segment availability, setting the stage for high precision physics data-taking.

## 3. On the Measurability of True Coincidence Summing in Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy

**作者**: Liam Schmidt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16679.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16679.pdf)

**摘要**: We generalize the summing correction formalism of Semkow this http URL 1990 into the Semkow Gamma Formalism and extend it into a multiplicity expansion. We use this formalism to calculate the matrix probabilities for 180 degree coincidence events as a method for correcting coincidence summing, and show the deviation between the full correction and this correction as a function of multiplicity. We further extend this to the Partitioned Gamma Formalism, to calculate probabilities for gated gamma rays; where two gammas of interest are taken in multi-detector coincidence. We look at the summing correction that is involved in the gated gammas and calculate deviations in a manner similar to that done to the singles. We define terms such as measurability and ontic and epistemic events and show that within our definitions, coincidence summing is not sufficiently measurable, or rather, its sufficient measurability is statistically bounded by the deviations we derive.

## 4. Regularized Unfolding of gamma-ray Spectra for Nuclear Physics Applications

**作者**: E. Lima, L. L. Braseth, A. H. Mjøs, M. Hjorth-Jensen, A. Kvellestad, A. C. Larsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16687.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16687.pdf)

**摘要**: Reconstructing gamma-ray spectra from detector measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard methods, such as Folding Iteration with Compton Subtraction (FICS), provide point estimates but lack calibrated uncertainties and may bias the spectrum. We introduce an unfolding framework based on regularized maximum-likelihood estimation (RMLE) that enforces non-negativity and detector-response constraints while explicitly modeling background and contaminant contributions. Simulations and analytical results show that RMLE yields smoother reconstructions with well-calibrated confidence intervals and outperforms existing techniques for low-complexity spectra. Although high-complexity data remain challenging, the intervals produced by RMLE maintain correct coverage.

**摘要**: The miniBELEN detector is a moderated neutron counter based on the use of $^3$He tubes and high-density polyethylene as moderator. The detector has been designed to have a neutron detection efficiency that is nearly independent from the initial neutron energy for ($\alpha$,n) reactions with alpha-particle energies up to 15 MeV. In order to achieve that, an innovative design methodology based on the use of cadmium neutron filters has been used. Monte Carlo calculations of the detector response have been validated using a $^{252}$Cf fission source. Measurements of the relatively well-known ($\alpha$,n) thick-target yields on aluminum have been found to be consistent with data from previous works. A method has been developed to correlate the counting rate ring ratios with the mean neutron energy and validated using previous time-of-flight measurements of the aluminum ($\alpha$,n) spectra and with a $^{252}$Cf fission source.

## 6. Maris polarization in the ($p,pd$) reaction

**作者**: Yoshiki Chazono

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16899.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16899.pdf)

**摘要**: Proton-induced knockout reactions at intermediate energies provide a clean probe for nuclear clusters with relatively small theoretical uncertainties. The Maris polarization, which is the effective polarization of a particle inside a nucleus arising from nuclear absorption and spin-orbit coupling, has been used in proton knockout to determine the total angular momentum $j$ of the removed protons. However, its manifestation in cluster knockout remains unexplored. We theoretically demonstrate that the Maris polarization can be observed via the vector analyzing power $A_y$ of the proton-induced deuteron knockout ($p,pd$) reaction in imbalanced kinematics. We first compute the spin-correlation coefficient $C_{y,y}$ of $p$-$d$ elastic scattering, which is an elementary process, to identify suitable kinematics for the Maris polarization. We then calculate $A_y$ of the ($p,pd$) reaction at $250$~MeV in forward kinematics for deuteron-cluster orbits with $j = 1$, $2$, and $3$. The large positive $C_{y,y}$ values around $p$-$d$ scattering angles of $\sim 40^\circ$ are consistent with the experimental data. In the corresponding ($p,pd$) kinematics, the calculated $A_y$ is positive for $j = 3$ and negative for $j = 1$, indicating effective upward and downward polarizations of the deuterons in the nucleus, respectively. The calculated $A_y$ for $j = 2$ lies between these and is not yet fully understood. We theoretically demonstrate that the Maris polarization occurs in the ($p,pd$) reaction under imbalanced kinematics. This work will provide an indicator of the presence and orbital motion of deuteron clusters in nuclei, which have not yet been established. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to improve the quantitative understanding of this effect, particularly for $j = 2$.

## 7. Magneto-$ν$: Heavy neutral lepton search using $^{241}$Pu $β^-$ decays

**摘要**: The MAGNETO-$\nu$ experiment searches for keV-scale heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) through precise measurements of the $\beta^-$-decay spectrum of $^{241}$Pu. We present spectra comprising a total of 194 million $\beta^-$ decays recorded using decay energy spectrometry with metallic magnetic calorimeters, representing the most statistically precise measurement of $^{241}$Pu $\beta^-$ decay to date. The $\beta$-endpoint energy was determined using $\gamma$ rays and X rays from an external $^{133}$Ba calibration source, yielding $Q_\beta = 22.273\,(33)$\,keV. The measured spectrum shows no statistically significant deviation from the allowed $\beta$-decay model. From a subset of the high-statistics data, we set an upper limit on the mixing of an 11.5-keV HNL with the electron neutrino, $|U_{e4}|^2 < 1.31 \times 10^{-3}$ at the 95\% confidence level.

## 8. Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment

**作者**: M. Tuveri, E. Murgia, V. Fanti

**摘要**: This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. The activity engaged students in collaborative exploration using a "black box" as an analogical model of the atom. Grounded in constructivist theory and the Focus Action-Reflection (FAR) model to introduce analogies in the in-class context, we explore how analogical reasoning can support high school students in understanding the atomic structure. Data from student worksheets, graphical representations, and group discussions were analyzed using thematic, phenomenographic, and conceptual metaphor analysis. Results indicate that students were able to develop and refine analogical models, reason from empirical evidence, and engage in critical reflection on the epistemological limits of the analogy. While students demonstrated conceptual gains and collaborative problem-solving, the analysis also revealed persistent risks of reifying metaphors or overextending macroscopic analogies to quantum domains. These findings highlight the value - and limitations - of structured analogical modeling in contemporary physics education, and point to the need for teacher training that fosters epistemological awareness and reflective use of models in the classroom.

## 9. Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio

**作者**: S. Kumano

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18305.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18305.pdf)

**摘要**: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.

## 10. Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates

**作者**: Nobuya Nishimura, Carla Froehlich, Thomas Rauscher

**摘要**: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.
