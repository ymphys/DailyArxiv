## 1. Insurance Supervision under Climate Change: A Pioneer Detection Method

**作者**: Eric Vansteenberhge

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16760.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16760.pdf)

**摘要**: We present the Pioneer Detection Method, a supervisory tool we developed to enhance resilience in insurance markets facing the challenges posed by climate change. Based on a theoretical model of the insurance industry, we consider a scenario in which independent experts determine premiums according to their individual risk assessments. Due to the segmented nature of the private insurance market, accurately estimating the tail parameter of loss distribution is difficult, especially given the rarity of extreme events. Our method leverages temporal directional change and convergence to integrate expert opinions, giving greater emphasis to those who effectively identify trend shifts after climate stress. A series of simulations reveals that the Pioneer Detection Method outperforms traditional pooling methods within a Bayesian framework. Furthermore, this approach appears to be notably effective in improving welfare in an insurance market with a limited number of private entities.

## 2. Reactive Marketing and the Co-Production of (In)Authenticity

**作者**: Preyas S. Desai, Jessie Liu

**摘要**: Businesses often react to external events by sending pro-social messages on social media that show the sender's alignment with the underlying prosocial cause and enhance their brand image. Consumers are uncertain about the authenticity of such messages because a company can choose to send prosocial messages even when their alignment with the social cause is not genuine. We study the sender's incentives to send (in)authentic messages and the consumer's reactions when an external investigator can verify the sender's message.
We find that the sender's equilibrium strategy depends on the receiver's emphasis on external investigation versus their self-signaling incentives. When the receiver is more internally focused, the sender chooses self-sufficiency strategy, building credibility independent of external investigation. When the receiver is more externally focused, the sender can either use self-sufficiency or complementarity, the latter relying on validation by the external investigator. Thus, authenticity is coproduced by the sender, the receiver, and the investigator. Importantly, self-sufficiency results in more authenticity in reactive marketing messages than complementarity.
We extend the model to incorporate confirmation bias of the receiver. We show that confirmation bias can act a doubled-edged sword, sometimes making the sender's persuasion task easier and other times making it more difficult.

## 3. Approximate Least-Favorable Distributions and Nearly Optimal Tests via Stochastic Mirror Descent

**作者**: Andrés Aradillas Fernández, José Blanchet, José Luis Montiel Olea, Chen Qiu, Jörg Stoye, Lezhi Tan

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16925.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16925.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider a class of hypothesis testing problems where the null hypothesis postulates $M$ distributions for the observed data, and there is only one possible distribution under the alternative. We show that one can use a stochastic mirror descent routine for convex optimization to provably obtain - after finitely many iterations - both an approximate least-favorable distribution and a nearly optimal test, in a sense we make precise. Our theoretical results yield concrete recommendations about the algorithm's implementation, including its initial condition, its step size, and the number of iterations. Importantly, our suggested algorithm can be viewed as a slight variation of the algorithm suggested by Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2015), whose theoretical performance guarantees are unknown.

## 4. Real Option AI: Reversibility, Silence, and the Release Ladder

**作者**: I. Sebastian Buhai

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16958.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16958.pdf)

**摘要**: We model the cadence of AI product releases, i.e. quiet spells, reversible patches, and rarer pivots, as optimal exercise of strategic real options under reputational learning. A privately observed technical state follows a diffusion. The firm controls two upgrade options with asymmetric costs and reversibility (a cheap patch and a costly pivot) and a publication-frequency clock, a Cox process whose intensity governs when noisy public performance and safety signals are disclosed. For sufficiently low clock costs the optimal policy posts observable clock-off windows around knife-edge regions. These windows shut down the martingale part of public beliefs, eliminate knife-edge mixing, and collapse behavior to a two-rung release ladder with endogenous triggers, jump targets, and no interior mixing. Within stationary Markov strategies we show that this ladder is uniquely characterized by a boundary-value system with value matching and smooth pasting at triggers and target optimality at jump targets. We endogenize market or platform adoption as a threshold rule in public beliefs and show that leverage creates an irreversibility wedge: the gap between first-best and levered surplus is bounded by the takeover switching cost of the least reversible rung. Patches are debt-insensitive; pivots can be distorted, but only up to that bound. The framework predicts telemetry signatures in firm-authored disclosures: a pre-release cadence dip in publication intensity and intra-month dispersion as the clock is shut off before a major reset; two post-release plateaus in disclosed performance, consistent with patch versus pivot jump targets; and debt-insensitive patch timing in high-reversibility regimes, with leverage effects concentrated in pivots. Unlike option-implied volatility spikes, these patterns reflect the firm's own throttling of technical signals rather than market pricing of event risk.

## 5. U.S. Economy and Global Stock Markets: Insights from a Distributional Approach

**作者**: Ping Wu, Dan Zhu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17140.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17140.pdf)

**摘要**: Financial markets are interconnected, with micro-currents propagating across global markets and shaping economic trends. This paper moves beyond traditional stock market indices to examine cross-sectional return distributions-15 in our empirical application, each representing a distinct global market. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting an overlooked policy transmission. This framework enables conditional forecasting, equipping policymakers with a flexible tool to assess macro-financial linkages under different economic scenarios.

## 6. Basically Trapped -- A General Equilibrium Approach to the Undersupply of Basic Research in Free Markets

**作者**: Lucas Darius Konrad

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17251.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17251.pdf)

**摘要**: In this paper I propose a micro-based innovation driven general equilibrium growth-model allowing for endogenous entry and exit as well as three different types of research. I make the novel distinction between three types of firms, namely basic and applied research where applied research is again differentiated into high and low type research to account for a heterogeneous firm environment. I further propose a new and flexible way to model basic research spillovers in this model class. While previous literature addresses the effect of R&D policies in general, my findings suggest, there is no optimal market solution in which basic research takes a noteworthy share. In order to counteract this undersupply and to take advantage of basic research spillovers, a sizable basic research subsidy is required to sufficiently crowd-in basic research which then allows for a substantial increase in welfare. My findings also suggest the necessity for purely state-financed basic research to approach the social planner solution in a feasible manner.

## 7. Delegation and Lobbying

**作者**: Thomas Groll, Sharyn O'Halloran

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17391.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17391.pdf)

**摘要**: This chapter examines the link between delegation and lobbying, two themes central to political economy. Delegation models explore how legislatures manage uncertainty and control bureaucratic agents, while lobbying models analyze how organized interests influence policy through contributions, information, and advocacy. We review the growing body of research that integrates these literatures, showing how the prospect of lobbying affects legislative incentives to delegate and how the structure of delegated authority shapes lobbying strategies. We highlight common-agency frameworks that capture the recursive relationship between delegation and lobbying and empirical studies documenting how venue choice, information provision, and interest group mobilization mediate delegation outcomes. We also review applications to agency oversight and fiscal policy. Finally, we present a model of regulatory rule-making that embeds lobbying directly into the delegation decision, offering predictions for both theory and empirical analysis.

## 8. Optimising pandemic response through vaccination strategies using neural networks

**作者**: Chang Zhai, Ping Chen, Zhuo Jin, David Pitt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16932.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16932.pdf)

**摘要**: Epidemic risk assessment poses inherent challenges, with traditional approaches often failing to balance health outcomes and economic constraints. This paper presents a data-driven decision support tool that models epidemiological dynamics and optimises vaccination strategies to control disease spread whilst minimising economic losses. The proposed economic-epidemiological framework comprises three phases: modelling, optimising, and analysing. First, a stochastic compartmental model captures epidemic dynamics. Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure. By employing this three-phase framework, policymakers can adjust input values to reflect evolving transmission dynamics and continuously update strategies, thereby minimising aggregate costs, aiding future pandemic preparedness.

## 9. Modified Delayed Acceptance MCMC for Quasi-Bayesian Inference with Linear Moment Conditions

**作者**: Masahiro Tanaka

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17117.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17117.pdf)

**摘要**: We develop a computationally efficient framework for quasi-Bayesian inference based on linear moment conditions. The approach employs a delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) algorithm that uses a surrogate target kernel and a proposal distribution derived from an approximate conditional posterior, thereby exploiting the structure of the quasi-likelihood. Two implementations are introduced. DA-MCMC-Exact fully incorporates prior information into the proposal distribution and maximizes per-iteration efficiency, whereas DA-MCMC-Approx omits the prior in the proposal to reduce matrix inversions, improving numerical stability and computational speed in higher dimensions. Simulation studies on heteroskedastic linear regressions show substantial gains over standard MCMC and conventional DA-MCMC baselines, measured by multivariate effective sample size per iteration and per second. The Approx variant yields the best overall throughput, while the Exact variant attains the highest per-iteration efficiency. Applications to two empirical instrumental variable regressions corroborate these findings: the Approx implementation scales to larger designs where other methods become impractical, while still delivering precise inference. Although developed for moment-based quasi-posteriors, the proposed approach also extends to risk-based quasi-Bayesian formulations when first-order conditions are linear and can be transformed analogously. Overall, the proposed algorithms provide a practical and robust tool for quasi-Bayesian analysis in statistical applications.

## 10. Deciphering the global production network from cross-border firm transactions

**作者**: Neave O'Clery, Ben Radcliffe-Brown, Thomas Spencer, Daniel Tarling-Hunter

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12315.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12315.pdf)

**摘要**: Critical for policy-making and business operations, the study of global supply chains has been severely hampered by a lack of detailed data. Here we harness international firm-level transaction data covering 20m global firms, and 1 billion cross-border transactions, to infer key inputs for over 1200 products. Transforming this data to a directed network, we find that products are clustered into three large groups including textiles, chemicals and food, and machinery and metals. European industrial nations and China dominate critical intermediate products such as metals, common components and tools, while industrial complexity is highly correlated with embeddedness in densely connected supply chains. We find structural similarities with AIPNET, a product network generated via LLM queries, and strong linkages between products identified in manually-mapped electric vehicle battery and semiconductor supply chains. Finally, both forward and backward linkages are predictive of country-product diversification patterns, with stronger overall evidence for backward (upstream) linkages.

## 11. Large Bayesian Tensor Autoregressions

**作者**: Yaling Qi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03097.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03097.pdf)

**摘要**: The availability of multidimensional economic datasets has grown significantly in recent years. An example is bilateral trade values across goods among countries, comprising three dimensions -- importing countries, exporting countries, and goods -- forming a third-order tensor time series. This paper introduces a general Bayesian tensor autoregressive framework to analyze the dynamics of large, multidimensional time series with a particular focus on international trade across different countries and sectors. Departing from the standard homoscedastic assumption in this literature, we incorporate flexible stochastic volatility into the tensor autoregressive models. The proposed models can capture time-varying volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent outbreaks of war. To address computational challenges and mitigate overfitting, we develop an efficient sampling method based on low-rank Tucker decomposition and hierarchical shrinkage priors. Additionally, we provide a factor interpretation of the model showing how the Tucker decomposition projects large-dimensional disaggregated trade flows onto global factors.
