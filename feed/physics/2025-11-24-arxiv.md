**摘要**: At a wind farm in Croatia, lightning activity is monitored across the entire site using a lightning location system, and on a single wind turbine equipped with a Rogowski-coil-based current measurement system and a high-speed camera, all independently GPS-synchronized. In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine. Failed upward connecting leaders were observed in some of these cases. This paper provides observational analysis, providing Rogowski measurements of electromagnetic disturbances and failed leader currents, complemented by high-speed camera and lightning location system data.

**摘要**: Our understanding of the weak mixing of quarks, described by the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix, currently presents an anomaly. Thanks to major strides in both theory and experiment, improved precision in determinations of the first row of matrix elements has revealed disagreement with the expectation of unitarity. The Nab experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source is designed to precisely extract the first matrix element $V_{ud}$ and shed light on experimental tensions within the neutron beta decay dataset. Nab's asymmetric spectrometer allows coincident reconstruction of the decay proton and electron energies, which will be used to determine the electron-neutrino correlation coefficient, and thus (with the neutron lifetime) determine $V_{ud}$. This unique approach has provided a more comprehensive view of neutron beta decay, including a first observation of the full momentum phase space of the decay above detector thresholds and limits on exotic neutron states. Recent upgrades to the Nab detector system have improved the robustness and stability of the detector performance in terms of proton detection efficiency, noise performance, and detector segment availability, setting the stage for high precision physics data-taking.

## 3. On the Measurability of True Coincidence Summing in Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy

**作者**: Liam Schmidt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16679.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16679.pdf)

**摘要**: We generalize the summing correction formalism of Semkow this http URL 1990 into the Semkow Gamma Formalism and extend it into a multiplicity expansion. We use this formalism to calculate the matrix probabilities for 180 degree coincidence events as a method for correcting coincidence summing, and show the deviation between the full correction and this correction as a function of multiplicity. We further extend this to the Partitioned Gamma Formalism, to calculate probabilities for gated gamma rays; where two gammas of interest are taken in multi-detector coincidence. We look at the summing correction that is involved in the gated gammas and calculate deviations in a manner similar to that done to the singles. We define terms such as measurability and ontic and epistemic events and show that within our definitions, coincidence summing is not sufficiently measurable, or rather, its sufficient measurability is statistically bounded by the deviations we derive.

## 4. PlatonSPAD: A novel SPAD sensor for large-scale high-resolution particle detectors

**作者**: Kodai Kaneyasu, Till Dieminger, Matthew Franks, Davide Sgalaberna, Claudio Bruschini, Edoardo Charbon

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16684.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16684.pdf)

**摘要**: High-resolution 3D tracking with sub-nanosecond timing is required for the detection of elementary particles, such as neutrinos. Conventional detectors, which utilize analog silicon photomultipliers, face challenges in balancing spatial resolution and scalability. To address this issue, a CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-based high-resolution particle detector is being developed. This work presents a study on SPAD layout optimization and a 4x4 SPAD macropixel module, fabricated in 110 nm CIS technology. Measurement results confirm that high-fill-factor designs improve photon detection efficiency without significant noise degradation. Furthermore, event-driven photon mapping and time stamping, enabled by time-to-digital converters and dedicated pixel circuits integrated into the 4x4 SPAD macropixel, were successfully demonstrated. This work is an essential step towards a sensor that detects probabilistic particle interactions and it lays the groundwork for the development of future large-scale SPAD-based particle detectors.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16686.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16686.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents the development of a compact leak detector for vacuum systems that operates using hydrogen as a tracer gas, detected by a semiconductor MQ-8 sensor. The sensor is connected to an Arduino microcontroller, enabling digital signal processing and real-time visualization through the Processing software environment. The designed device is capable of detecting even small hydrogen leaks caused by imperfect sealing of vacuum connections. It is characterized by simplicity, low manufacturing cost, and suitability for laboratory use as an alternative to helium leak detectors. Experimental tests confirmed the effectiveness and stability of the developed leak detector during long-term measurements.

## 6. Regularized Unfolding of gamma-ray Spectra for Nuclear Physics Applications

**作者**: E. Lima, L. L. Braseth, A. H. Mjøs, M. Hjorth-Jensen, A. Kvellestad, A. C. Larsen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16687.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16687.pdf)

**摘要**: Reconstructing gamma-ray spectra from detector measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard methods, such as Folding Iteration with Compton Subtraction (FICS), provide point estimates but lack calibrated uncertainties and may bias the spectrum. We introduce an unfolding framework based on regularized maximum-likelihood estimation (RMLE) that enforces non-negativity and detector-response constraints while explicitly modeling background and contaminant contributions. Simulations and analytical results show that RMLE yields smoother reconstructions with well-calibrated confidence intervals and outperforms existing techniques for low-complexity spectra. Although high-complexity data remain challenging, the intervals produced by RMLE maintain correct coverage.

**摘要**: The miniBELEN detector is a moderated neutron counter based on the use of $^3$He tubes and high-density polyethylene as moderator. The detector has been designed to have a neutron detection efficiency that is nearly independent from the initial neutron energy for ($\alpha$,n) reactions with alpha-particle energies up to 15 MeV. In order to achieve that, an innovative design methodology based on the use of cadmium neutron filters has been used. Monte Carlo calculations of the detector response have been validated using a $^{252}$Cf fission source. Measurements of the relatively well-known ($\alpha$,n) thick-target yields on aluminum have been found to be consistent with data from previous works. A method has been developed to correlate the counting rate ring ratios with the mean neutron energy and validated using previous time-of-flight measurements of the aluminum ($\alpha$,n) spectra and with a $^{252}$Cf fission source.

## 8. Radiation Effects on Stepper Motors and Lubricants: A Review

**作者**: Logan Jackson, Victor Boyer, Tanner Rima, Edward Cazalas

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16694.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16694.pdf)

**摘要**: The use of electrical motors and other remote systems are important tools in radiation environments. Certain harsh radiation environments, such as particle accelerators, require the use of remote systems during operation. Stepper motors are one motor, in particular, that have acquired interest in the nuclear field for use in these remote systems. The stepper motor's precision in rotation and holding is a highly desired quality. In this review, the stepper motor is examined for use in radiation environments. The different mechanical parts are introduced and examined from the broader literature of previous work. We attempt to explain the different radiation destructive mechanisms involved with each part of the stepper motor and how the mechanics are affected. Current and past research is explored, identifying either radiation hard alternatives or thresholds of the materials involved, and a general review of stepper motor radiation effects as available in literature.

## 9. Chemical Systems as Ternary $Γ$-Semirings:Theory, Case Studies, and Operational Tests

**作者**: Chandrasekhar Gokavarapu, Venkata Rao Kaviti, Srinivasa Rao Thirunagari, D. Madhusudhana Rao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16697.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16697.pdf)

**摘要**: Chemical systems are traditionally described by lists of species, reactions, and externally imposed kinetic laws, a framework that lacks an intrinsic algebraic structure governing how transformations compose. We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices. The resulting framework unifies equilibrium, kinetics, regulation, and chemical computation within a single algebraic language, offering new principles for the analysis and design of responsive or self-regulating materials.

## 10. Catalytic Resonance Theory: Kinetics and Frequency Response of Light-Promoted Catalysis

**作者**: Paul J Dauenhauer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16701.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16701.pdf)

**摘要**: The illumination of catalytic surfaces with a continuous or pulsed stream of photons dynamically modulates surface chemistry for faster rates, higher conversion, or product selectivity control. To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux). The maximum photocatalytic rate occurred orders of magnitude above the Sabatier limit at the resonance frequency, identified as the photon arrival frequency that matched the surface reaction rate constant. Non-equilibrium photocatalytic conversion occurred when the rate of photon-promoted product desorption was comparable to the rate of thermal product desorption. Results indicated the general utility of photon-promoted catalysis, with negligible benefit for rate enhancement and quantum yield with photon source pulsing or chopping due to the inherent dynamic nature of photons from light sources.

**作者**: Jikai Chen, Zhi Zeng, Hao Ma, Jianping Cheng

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16704.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16704.pdf)

**摘要**: Four ultra-low background germanium spectrometers, called GeTHU, have been installed at the first phase of China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL-I), and served for material screening of dark matter and neutrino experiments. Recently, a new multi-detector spectrometer with five germanium detectors has been developed and installed at the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a minimum detectable activity (MDA) of about 10 {\mu}Bq/kg. In addition, another fifteen GeTHU-like spectrometers have been installed at CJPL-II with an MDA of about 1 mBq/kg. This paper will introduce the ultra-low background germanium spectrometers including shielding design, background characteristics and application to material screening.

## 12. Unblockable Communication With Gravity

**作者**: Andrew J. Groszek, Charles W. Woffinden, Michael D. Harvey, Andrew G. White, Matthew J. Davis

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16710.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16710.pdf)

**摘要**: All modern wireless communication technologies are based on electromagnetism. However, electromagnetic signals are susceptible to screening and blocking, so their availability cannot be guaranteed in adverse environments. This raises a fundamental question: Can information be transmitted through a truly unblockable channel? Here we show that gravity, unlike electromagnetism, offers such a path. We propose and implement a wireless communication protocol in which a broadcaster encodes a binary message by moving a mass, while a receiver detects the resulting gravitational signal with a gravimeter. We validate this scheme experimentally, successfully transmitting a gravitational message a distance of $\approx$ 0.7 m through a brick wall at a rate of 1 bit min$^{-1}$. These results establish gravity as a viable platform for unblockable communication.

## 13. A Respiratory Motion Analysis for Guiding Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radiotherapy Motion Management

**作者**: Yuhao Wang, Yao Hao, Hongyu An, H Michael Gach, Clifford Robinson, Phillip S Cuculich, Deshan Yang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16775.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16775.pdf)

**摘要**: Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radiotherapy (STAR) treats ventricular tachycardia (VT) but requires internal target volume (ITV) expansions to compensate for cardiorespiratory motion. Current clinical r4DCT imaging methods are limited, and the reconstructed r4DCTs suffer from unmanaged cardiac motion artifacts that affect the quantitative assessment of respiratory motion. A groupwise surface-to-surface deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm, named gCGF, was developed. A novel principal component filtering (PCF) mechanism and a spatial smoothing mechanism were developed and incorporated into gCGF to iteratively register heart contours from an average respiratory-phase CT to ten r4DCT phases while removing random cardiac motion from the cyclic respiratory motion. The performance of the groupwise DIR was quantitatively validated using 8 digital phantoms with simulated cardiac artifacts. An ablation study was conducted to compare gCGF to another comparable state-of-the-art groupwise DIR method. gCGF was applied to r4DCTs of 20 STAR patients to analyze the respiratory motion of the heart. Validation on digital phantoms showed that gCGF achieved a mean target registration error of 0.63+-0.51 mm while successfully achieving phase smoothness and reducing cardiac motion artifacts. Among all STAR patients, the heart's maximum and mean respiratory motion magnitudes ranged from 3.6 to 7.9 mm and 1.0 mm to 2.6 mm. The peak-to-peak motion range was from 6.2 to 14.7 mm. For VT targets, the max and mean motion magnitude ranges were 3.0 to 6.7 mm and 0.8 to 2.9 mm, respectively. The peak-to-peak range was from 4.7 to 11.8 mm. Significant dominance of the first principal component of the motion direction was observed (p = 0).

## 14. Behind the logarithmic growth of inner-scaled wall-pressure variance

**作者**: Jonathan M. O. Massey, Joseph C. Klewicki, Beverley J. McKeon

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16776.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16776.pdf)

**摘要**: In high-Reynolds-number zero-pressure-gradient turbulent channel flow, the inner-scaled wall-pressure variance follows a logarithmic increase with frictional Reynolds number of the form $\langle p_w^{+2}\rangle = B_{\mathcal{L}} + A_{\mathcal{Q}} \ln \delta^+$.
We consider the two sources of the pressure Poisson equation: a linear (i.e., rapid) term linked to mean shear and a nonlinear (i.e., slow) term from quadratic velocity fluctuations. The goal of this paper is to provide a mechanistic link between the sources of the pressure Poisson equation and the coefficients in the inner-scaled variance form above. We tie the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$ to the linear source and connect the coefficient $A_{\mathcal{Q}}$ to the nonlinear source. The illustrative dataset is direct numerical simulation (DNS) at $\delta^+\approx 550$, although the principal contribution is the establishment of a mechanistic link that allows us to connect well-known high-$\delta^+$ scalings of wall-bounded turbulence.
Through consideration of the spectral content of the sources and the integral solution method of the Poisson equation, we find that the linear source contribution sits predominantly in the buffer layer and maps to the near-wall cycle. This contribution becomes $\delta^+$ invariant under inner scaling, thus contributing the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$.
The interfacial region between uniform momentum zones starting in the log layer (fissures) concentrates strain and vorticity contributions in the log layer and contains an increasingly large proportion of the strain and vorticity. We show that fissures act as a compact carrier for the source terms, with the nonlinear term especially prominent in this region. Then, by considering the inertial layer statistics, we tie the changing nonlinear contribution to $A_{\mathcal{Q}}$.

## 16. Hierarchical Bayesian constitutive model selection for high-strain-rate soft material characterization

**作者**: Victor Sanchez, Sawyer Remillard, Bachir A. Abeid, Lehu Bu, Spencer H. Bryngelson, Jin Yang, Jonathan B. Estrada, Mauro Rodriguez Jr

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16794.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16794.pdf)

**摘要**: The high-fidelity characterization of soft, tissue-like materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions is critical in engineering and medicine. Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility. Physically informed priors, including range-invariant, stress-based parameter priors, a model-redundancy prior, and a Bayesian Information Criterion motivated model prior, penalize complex models to enforce Occam's razor. Using a precomputed grid of simulations, the probabilistic model selection process enables an initial guess for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) material parameter values. Synthetic tests recover the ground-truth models and expected parameters. Using experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose, MAP simulations of credible models reproduce the data. Moreover, a cross-institutional comparison of 10% gelatin indicates consistent constitutive model selection.

## 17. The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems

**作者**: Thomas Philippe, Yijian Wu, Aymane Graini

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16798.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16798.pdf)

**摘要**: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.

## 18. Double-Profile Intersection (DoPIo) Ultrasound: Pointwise Shear Elasticity Estimation using Paired Confocal Displacement Profiles

**作者**: Keita Yokoyama, Murad Hossain, Sabiq Muhtadi, Caterina Gallippi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16878.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16878.pdf)

**摘要**: Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.

## 19. Broadband telecom single-photon emissions from InAs/InP quantum dots grown by MOVPE droplet epitaxy

**作者**: Shichen Zhang, Li Liu, Kai Guo, Xingli Mu, Yuanfei Gao, Junqi Liu, Fengqi Liu, Quanyong Lu, Zhiliang Yuan

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16894.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16894.pdf)

**摘要**: The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications.

## 20. Exponentially enhanced sensing through nonreciprocal light propagation

**作者**: Paul-Édouard Blanchard, Alexander McDonald, Philippe St-Jean

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16895.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16895.pdf)

**摘要**: Non-reciprocity is a key resource for pushing the performance of photonic devices beyond the fundamental limits imposed by Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.

## 21. Spin-adapted open-shell time-dependent density functional theory: towards a simple and accurate method for spin-flip-down excitations

**作者**: Hewang Zhao, Zhendong Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16906.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16906.pdf)

**摘要**: A major challenge in using spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TD-DFT) for spin-flip-down excitations is the presence of spin contamination. While several improved methods have been developed in the past, a simple and accurate method remains elusive. Here, based on our previous development on spin-adapted open-shell TD-DFT for spin-conserving excitations (X-TD-DFT) [Z. Li and W. Liu, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 194106 (2011)], we introduce a method termed as XSF-TDA for modeling spin-flip-down excitations, and provide an in-depth comparison of different methodologies for mitigating spin contamination in SF-TDA. Pilot applications to prototype systems demonstrate the promise of XSF-TDA over existing SF-TDA methods, including unrestricted SF-TDA (USF-TDA) and mixed-reference SF-TDA (MRSF-TDA), in describing bond breakings and inverted singlet-triplet gap systems.

## 22. Humidity lightens the air but hinders human evaporative cooling in arid heat

**作者**: Shri H. Viswanathan, Ankit Joshi, Isabella DeClair, Bryce Twidwell, Muhammad Abdullah, Lyle Bartels, Faisal Abedin, Joseph Rotella, Cibin T. Jose, Konrad Rykaczewski

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16922.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16922.pdf)

**摘要**: Overheating poses significant threats to human health and productivity. In hot conditions, the human body primarily cools through sweat evaporation; however, we show that understanding of physical phenomena controlling the evaporation rate is surprisingly incomplete. This rate is equal to the product of the skin to air water vapor concentration difference and the flow dependent mass transfer coefficient, which, according to the Lewis heat and mass transfer analogy, is proportional to the convective heat transfer coefficient. In low wind, free convection conditions, current models for the human heat transfer coefficients consider only temperature driven air buoyancy. Here, we show that in arid heat, humidity from sweat exerts a comparable but opposing buoyant effect. Using sweating thermal manikin experiments and digital twin multiphysics simulations, we demonstrate that the dueling thermal and humidity induced buoyancy can severely suppress sweat evaporation (e.g., by over half in conditions that occur in Arizona for one-third of the year). Neglecting humidity-induced buoyancy leads to substantial errors in thermoregulation model predictions; within 2 hour exposure to typical arid heat conditions, core temperature increases by 1C more than predicted by legacy calculations. We provide compact, physics informed models for free convective heat transfer coefficients for wide temperature and humidity ranges, enabling improved thermoregulation modeling and thermal audits for more accurate heat stress assessment and optimization of extreme heat mitigation strategies.

## 23. Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN): An End-to-End Direct Probabilistic Framework for Characterizing Hydraulic Conductivities and Quantifying Uncertainty

**作者**: Xun Zhang, Weijie Yang, Jiangjiang Zhang, Simin Jiang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16926.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16926.pdf)

**摘要**: We propose the Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN) framework for inverse modeling of groundwater flow and solute transport processes. DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification. The framework exhibits strong generalization capability across diverse data distributions, offering a robust and unified alternative to conventional multi-stage inversion methodologies.

**摘要**: In mixed quantum-classical simulations of molecule-metal surface interactions, the discretization of the metallic electronic continuum typically results in a closed-system representation that fails to capture the open-system nature of the true physical process. This approximation can introduce significant artifacts, including deviations in the dynamical evolution and a violation of the principle of detailed balance. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce an electronic thermostat into our previously developed orbital surface hopping (OSH) framework, generalizing the method to efficiently handle many discrete electronic states. We first outline the derivation of electronic thermostat orbital surface hopping, where the amplitude of the electronic thermostat is well justified. We then demonstrate that this method can reproduce accurate dynamics and detailed balance in long time, whereas without electronic thermostat the detailed balance is violated. Thus, this method offers a reliable tool for studying nonadiabatic dynamics near metal surfaces.

**作者**: Qijun You, Lingshuo Meng, Fangrui Quan, Wei Cao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16950.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16950.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a novel axial ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging (AP-CDI) technique designed to overcome the critical throughput bottleneck of conventional methods. By replacing the 2D raster scan with a simple 1D axial scan, our approach reduces the number of required diffraction patterns by approximately an order of magnitude while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. We have experimentally validated this concept, successfully performing simultaneous spectroscopic imaging of a sample and quantitative wavefront characterization of the illumination, thereby accurately quantifying the chromatic aberration of a broadband field. This capability establishes AP-CDI as a highly efficient and versatile tool for real-time, multi-modal imaging, with immediate potential in ultrafast science, material characterization, and live-cell bio-imaging.

**作者**: Shin-ichiro Kai, Ryota Horiguchi, Jian Xing, Kentaro Wada

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16962.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16962.pdf)

**摘要**: This study validates the continuum traffic flow model of capacity drop at sag and tunnel bottlenecks, as proposed by Jin (2018) and Wada et al. (2020), through empirical analysis. Specifically, after addressing the limitations in the existing studies, we calibrate the model using data from multiple congestion events at several expressway bottlenecks. We then demonstrate that the model can reproduce the observed speed recovery near the head of the queue, and assess whether both estimated bottleneck capacities and locations are consistent with observed traffic conditions. Finally, as an application of the calibration results, we examine the relationship between the spatial changes in the estimated traffic capacity and longitudinal gradients.

## 27. Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss

**作者**: Rui Li, Yi Li, Kai-Ya Zhang, Qing Ai

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16984.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16984.pdf)

**摘要**: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.

## 28. A Priori Assessment of Rotational Invariance in Multiscale CNN-Based Subgrid-Scale Model for Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows

**作者**: Bahrul Jalaali, Kie Okabayashi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16995.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16995.pdf)

**摘要**: This study proposes a rotationally invariant data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building upon the multiscale convolutional neural network subgrid-scale model, which outputs SGS stress tensors ($\tau_{ij}$) as the baseline, the deep neural network (DNN) architecture is modified to satisfy the principle of material objectivity by removing the bias terms and batch normalization layers while incorporating a spatial transformer network (STN) algorithm. The model was trained on a turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 180$ and evaluated using both non-rotated and rotated inputs. The results show that the model performs well in predicting $\tau_{ij}$ and key turbulence statistics, including dissipation, backscatter, and SGS transport. These quantities reflect the ability of the model to reproduce the energy transfer between the resolved scale and SGS. Moreover, it effectively generalizes to unseen rotated inputs, accurately predicting $\tau_{ij}$ despite the input configurations not being encountered during the training. These findings highlight that modifying the DNN architecture and integrating the STN-based algorithm improves the ability to recognize and correctly respond to rotated inputs. The proposed data-driven SGS model addresses the key limitations of common data-driven SGS approaches, particularly their sensitivity to rotated input conditions. It also marks an important advancement in data-driven SGS modeling for LES, particularly in flow configurations where rotational effects are non-negligible.

## 29. Improvements of the GPU Processing Framework for ALICE

**作者**: David Rohr

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17018.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17018.pdf)

**摘要**: ALICE is the dedicated heavy ion experiment at the LHC at CERN and records lead-lead collisions at a rate of up to 50 kHz. The detector with the highest data rate of up to 3.4 TB/s is the TPC. ALICE performs the full online TPC processing corresponding to more than 95\% of the total workload on GPUs, and when there is no beam in the LHC, the online computing farm's GPUs are used to speed up the offline processing. After the deployment of the first version of the online TPC processing needed for data taking, ALICE has implemented many improvements to its GPU processing framework. These include a run time compilation mode applying on the fly optimizations, improvements to parallelize / speed up the GPU compilation, debugging modes to guarantee reproducible and deterministic results in concurrent reconstruction, and framework features to leverage common components in the code of different detectors. The proceedings give an overview of the ALICE experience with GPUs in online and offline processing and present the latest GPU processing framework features.

## 30. Etendue and Radiance Conservation in Transformation Optics: Strict Analytical Bounds on Field Enhancement

**作者**: Mohammad Mehdi Sadeghi, Mustafa Sarisaman

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17021.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17021.pdf)

**摘要**: We establish an intuitive connection between transformation optics (TO) and the classical invariants of etendue and radiance that hasn't been made before. Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field. This provides a consistent, metric-based elucidation for the intrinsic limitations of concentration in passive metamaterials and extreme-index platforms.

**作者**: M. Sun, R. Gómez, B. Damilano, J. M. Asensi, F. B. Naranjo, S. Valdueza-Felip

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17037.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17037.pdf)

**摘要**: Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of InN nanowire solar cells deposited by RF sputtering with a bandgap energy of 1.78 eV. By adding an amorphous Si (a-Si) buffer to the n-InN/p-Si structure, we have improved the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices while maintaining their material quality. We have firstly optimized the deposition of Si on Si(100) by DC sputtering, obtaining an amorphous material with bandgap energy of 1.39 eV. Then we have studied the influence of the thickness of the a-Si buffer layer (0-25 nm) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of InN nanowires on Si (100) substrates. With the use of a 15-nm buffer, n-InN/a-Si/p-Si nanowire heterojunction solar cells exhibit a promising short-circuit current density of 17 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 0.37 V and fill factor of 35.5%, pointing to a power-conversion efficiency of 2.3% under 1-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. These work demonstrated that the combination of in-situ sputtered a-Si, which could serve as potential passivation layer, and the light trapping enhancement by the nanostructured active layer leads to an improvement of the photovoltaic efficiency of sputtered III-nitride devices.

## 32. Asymmetry and coverage dependence in two-pulse correlation measurements of CO photodesorption from Pd(111): Insights from theory

**作者**: Raúl Bombín, Alberto S. Muzas, Alfredo Serrano Jiménez, J. Iñaki Juaristi, Maite Alducin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17042.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17042.pdf)

**摘要**: Two-pulse correlation experiments performed using pulses of different intensities on Pd(111) with different CO coverages showed that the CO photodesorption probability depends on whether the strong or the weak pulse arrives first to the surface, being this difference particularly large for the low-covered surface. Motivated by these experiments, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a multicoverage potential energy surface that was previously constructed with the embedded atom neural network method. The process is modeled by combining the two-temperature model (2TM)--to describe the laser-excited electrons and phonons--and Langevin dynamics with electronic time-dependent temperature $T_\textrm{e}$--to model the coupling of the nuclei degrees of freedom with the laser-excited electrons. We show that improving the energy balance description in 2TM--by including \textit{ab-initio} $T_\textrm{e}$-dependent electronic heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling constant--is key to reproduce the asymmetry of the photodesorption probability $P_{\rm des}$ between positive and negative time delays. Furthermore, we also explore possible reasons for the usual underestimation of $P_{\rm des}$ at zero delay given by state-of-the-art calculations. In particular, we improve the description of the energy exchange between CO and the metal surface at high $T_\textrm{e}$ by including in the simulations a $T_\textrm{e}$-dependent friction coefficient. The prediction for $P_{\rm des}$ at zero delay in this case, increases by an order of magnitude, reducing its discrepancy with the experimental value. Altogether, our results hint to the importance of accounting for the temperature dependence of the electronic structure and properties in describing the extreme conditions generated in 2PC experiments.

## 33. Density and excess molar enthalpy of (2-propanol + glyme) liquid mixtures. Application of the Flory model

**作者**: João Victor Alves-Laurentino, Fatemeh Pazoki, Luis Felipe Sanz, Juan Antonio González, Fernando Hevia, Daniel Lozano-Martín

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17057.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17057.pdf)

**摘要**: For glymes of general formula CH3O(CH2CH2O)uCH3, with u = 1, 2, 3, 4, the densities of the (2-propanol + glyme) systems at temperatures ranging from (293.15 to 303.15) K and at pressure 0.1 MPa were determined using a DSA 5000 densimeter (from Anton Paar). The corresponding excess molar volumes were calculated from these density measurements. In addition, excess molar enthalpies at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa were measured using a Tian-Calvet micro-calorimeter. The results show that alkanol-ether interactions are strong but do not contribute significantly to the excess molar enthalpy, as the values are large and positive, and comparable to those of (glyme + n-heptane) systems. The excess molar volumes are small or even negative (in the case of the mixture with u = 4), indicating that they are mainly governed by structural effects. Mixtures with 1-propanol or 2-propanol behave similarly, although interactions between unlike molecules become slightly stronger when 1-propanol is involved. On the other hand, effects related to alcohol self-association play a decisive role in the thermodynamic properties when glymes are replaced by di-n-propyl ether. This is supported by the application of the Flory model, which shows that orientational effects are weak in the studied glyme-containing mixtures but become significantly stronger when di-n-propyl ether is considered.

## 34. Collapse of turbulence in curved pipe flow

**作者**: Eman Bagheri, Stefan Becker, Philipp Schlatter

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17073.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17073.pdf)

**摘要**: The increased friction caused by turbulence is a significant contributor to energy consumption in the fluid-transport and piping industries. Here we describe a passive approach to reduce friction: we show that a local increase in streamwise flow curvature, combined with changing the circular cross-section to an oval, relaminarizes turbulent flow in curved pipes. We exemplify this effect in a $180^\circ$ bend at $Re_D = 10\,000$ and $20\,000$, well above the linear-stability limit. Curvature inhibits streamwise Reynolds stresses, and cross-sectional modifications weaken the secondary flow, together disrupting the near-wall regeneration cycle and collapsing turbulence. Simulations and experiments confirm that these geometric modifications suppress turbulence and reduce pressure loss by 53% and 36% compared with the baseline $180^\circ$ bend and an equal-length fully developed straight pipe, respectively. The results establish a passive, mechanism-based route to relaminarization in curved pipes with implications for energy-efficient control in other wall-bounded flows with curvature.

**作者**: Sarathchandra Khandavilli, Arno Förster, Lucas Visscher

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17077.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17077.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a fragment-based framework for analyzing exciton couplings within the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter Equation formalism using localized molecular orbitals, and assess how excitonic states in molecular dimers can be decomposed into local and charge-transfer (CT) sectors. Our localization procedure preserves orbital orthonormality via a block-diagonal unitary transformation, enabling a simple and interpretable analysis of excitonic interactions. Using ethylene and pyrene dimers as model systems, we identify key effects of excitonic basis truncation and coupling approximations on excitation energies. We then extend the method to chlorophyll dimers, where weak CT asymmetries emerge due to geometric distortions. This framework offers a tractable route to analyze excitonic behavior in complex systems and paves the way for future fragment-based reconstruction of full exciton coupling matrices in large molecular assemblies.

## 36. Modeling memory in time-respecting paths on temporal networks

**作者**: Silvia Guerrini, Ciro Cattuto, Lorenzo Dall'Amico

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17108.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17108.pdf)

**摘要**: Human close-range proximity interactions are the key determinant for spreading processes like knowledge diffusion, norm adoption, and infectious disease transmission. These dynamical processes can be modeled with time-respecting paths on temporal networks. Here, we propose a framework to quantify memory in time-respecting paths and evaluate it on several empirical datasets encoding proximity between humans collected in different settings. Our results show strong memory effects, robust across settings, model parameters, and statistically significant when compared to memoryless null models. We further propose a generative model to create synthetic temporal graphs with memory and use it to show that memory in time-respecting paths decreases the diffusion speed, affecting the dynamics of spreading processes on temporal networks.

## 37. Transport and removal of a passive tracer in porous media employing surface washing

**作者**: Georgia Ioannou, Francesco Paolo Cont`o, Merlin A. Etzold, Julien R. Landel, Stuart B. Dalziel

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17115.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17115.pdf)

**摘要**: This experimental study investigates the dynamics of surface washing to remove a passive tracer from a porous plate by a gravity-driven liquid film across its surface. A disodium fluorescein tracer is introduced at the surface of a water-saturated porous plate and allowed to diffuse into the plate for a number of hours before a film of water solution flows over its surface to extract and transport the tracer away. The removal rate of the tracer is monitored quantitatively by using fluorescence measurements to determine the concentration in the effluent from the washing process. These measurements are supplemented by dye-attenuation imaging, which provides mainly qualitative insights about the tracer's concentration distribution on the porous plate surface. Our findings reveal a three-stage mass-transport process consisting of an initial period of rapid removal of the tracer found within the surface roughness, followed by a period of slower removal, which appears to be limited by vertical diffusion, and a third stage of accelerated advection-dominated removal when the tracer-rich region that was transported downstream during the second stage reaches the downstream boundary of the porous plate. A parametric study explores the influence of the characteristics of the washing film, the permeability of the porous plate, the amount and initial spatial extent of the tracer on the porous plate and the tracer's diffusive penetration depth on the mass removal rates. Our insights offer practical guidance for optimising surface washing protocols for porous systems in industrial and environmental applications.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17141.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17141.pdf)

**摘要**: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17158.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17158.pdf)

**摘要**: Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes

**作者**: Andy Haverly, So Yeon Kim, Ju Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17174.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17174.pdf)

**摘要**: Climate change is a rapidly accelerating problem that requires fast and large-scale carbon sequestration to prevent catastrophe. This paper proposes a novel approach to use explosives for large-scale carbon sequestration. Combining the long-practiced method of explosive mining with newer enhanced rock weathering techniques, we propose a faster, greener, and profitable method of large-scale carbon sequestration. This method is applicable for all explosives, including thermonuclear, and can be done safely with minimal anthropological and ecological impact. We estimate a cost of $0.68/ton of CO2 sequestered.

## 41. On the Predictive Skill of Artificial Intelligence-based Weather Models for Extreme Events using Uncertainty Quantification

**作者**: Rodrigo Almeida, Noelia Otero, Miguel-Ángel Fernández-Torres, Jackie Ma

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17176.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17176.pdf)

**摘要**: Accurate prediction of extreme weather events remains a major challenge for artificial intelligence based weather prediction systems. While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.

## 42. Orbital rotation of spheroidal Mie particles driven by counter-propagating circularly-polarized beams

**作者**: E. N. Bulgakov, A. E. Ershov, V. Kimberg, V. S. Gerasimov, D. N. Maksimov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17177.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17177.pdf)

**摘要**: We theoretically consider orbital rotation of a spheroidal submicron particle in the field of two counter-propagating circularly polarized Gaussian beams. We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17192.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17192.pdf)

**摘要**: Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) enables three-dimensional imaging of nuclear spin densities in nanoscale objects. Based on numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of strained SiN resonators as force sensors and show that their out-of-plane oscillation direction improves the quality of the reconstructed sample. We further introduce a multislice, compressed-sensing scan protocol that maximizes the information obtained for a given measurement time. Our simulations predict that these new scanning protocols and optimized algorithms can shorten the total acquisition time by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining the reconstruction fidelity. Our results demonstrate that combining advanced scanning protocols with state-of-the-art resonators is a promising path toward high-resolution MRFM for volumetric imaging of biological nanostructures.

## 44. Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals as Charge Boosters for Triboelectric Nanogenerators

**作者**: Jia-Yao Ye, Susanta Chakraborty, Karthick Subramani, Xing-Zhou Tang, Yan-Nan Xie, Bing-Xiang Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17202.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17202.pdf)

**摘要**: Driven by growing demand for clean energy, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as promising self-powered systems, yet achieving high charge density remains a critical challenge. In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management. This work establishes NF-LC-based TENGs as a new platform for high-performance self-powered energy harvesting, linking soft matter physics with applied energy technology.

**作者**: Florian Krötz, Xiao-Ting Michelle To, Korbinian Staudacher, Dieter Kranzlmüller

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17218.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17218.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.

## 47. Signed Networks: theory, methods, and applications

**作者**: Fernando Diaz-Diaz, Elena Candellone, Miguel A. Gonzalez-Casado, Emma Fraxanet, Antoine Vendeville, Irene Ferri, Andreia Sofia Teixeira

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17247.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17247.pdf)

**摘要**: Signed networks provide a principled framework for representing systems in which interactions are not merely present or absent but qualitatively distinct: friendly or antagonistic, supportive or conflicting, excitatory or inhibitory. This polarity reshapes how we think about structure and dynamics in complex systems: a negative tie is not simply a missing positive one but a constraint that generates tension, and possibly asymmetry. Across disciplines, from sociology to neuroscience and machine learning, signed networks provide a shared language to formalise duality, balance, and opposition as integral components of system behaviour. This review provides a comprehensive and foundational summary of signed network theory. It formalises the mathematical principles of signed graphs and surveys signed-network-specific measures, including signed degree distributions, clustering, centralities, motifs, and Laplacians. It revisits balance theory, tracing its cognitive and structural formulations and their connections to frustration. Structural aspects of signed networks are examined, analysing key topics such as null models, node embeddings, sign prediction, and community detection. Subsequent sections address dynamical processes on and of signed networks, such as opinion dynamics, contagion models, and data-driven approaches for studying evolving networks. Practical challenges in constructing, inferring and validating signed data from real-world systems are also highlighted, and we offer an overview of currently available datasets. We also address common pitfalls and challenges that arise when modelling or analysing signed data. Overall, this review integrates theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and cross-domain examples, providing a structured entry point and a reference framework for researchers interested in the study of signed networks in complex systems.

## 48. Performance of the front-end electronics of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel for the High-Luminosity LHC

**作者**: CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter Group

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17261.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17261.pdf)

**摘要**: The performance of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter upgraded readout electronics, developed for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC, is discussed. Data collected in two beam test campaigns conducted in 2018 and 2021 at the H4 and H2 beam lines of the CERN SPS are analyzed. Time and energy resolutions are measured on a $5\times 5$ matrix of lead tungstate crystals equipped with prototypes of the new front end readout electronics, using electron and pion beams of energies spanning from 25 to 250 GeV. In both campaigns the constant term of the energy resolution is measured to be better than 0.6% and the time resolution for electrons with energies above 50 GeV is measured to be better than 30 ps, fulfilling the design requirements.

## 49. A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation

**作者**: Andrea Medaglia

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17286.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17286.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.

## 50. The impact of ionising collisions on channeling and radiation emission for high-energy electrons and positrons

**作者**: Andrei V. Korol, Andrey V. Solov'yov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17287.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17287.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions with atoms in a crystalline environment on the channeling efficiency and intensity of the channeling radiation for high-energy electrons and positrons passing through oriented crystalline targets. This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper.

## 51. Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization

**作者**: Matt Landreman, Humberto Torreblanca, Antoine Cerfon

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17305.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17305.pdf)

**摘要**: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.

## 52. Characterisation and mitigation of RF knockout during beam stacking

**作者**: Carl Jolly, David Kelliher, Jean-Baptiste Lagrange, Alan Letchford, Shinji Machida, David Posthuma de Boer, Chris Rogers, Andrew Seville

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17314.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17314.pdf)

**摘要**: Beam stacking allows a Fixed Field alternating gradient Accelerator (FFA) to increase the extracted beam current whilst also allowing for a flexible time structure making FFAs a promising candidate for future spallation neutron sources and high beam intensity applications. For successful beam stacking, beam loss caused by RF knockout must be avoided. RF knockout can occur during beam stacking because of the finite dispersion function at the RF cavity location, which is unavoidable in a scaling FFA. In this work, the RF knockout resonance is characterised and through a series of experiments at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, we show that it is possible to suppress the loss from RF knockout.

## 53. Aspects of quantum geometry in photonic time crystals

**作者**: Karthik Subramaniam Eswaran, Ali Emami Kopaei, Krzysztof Sacha

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17317.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17317.pdf)

**摘要**: We develop a geometric description of quantum light in photonic time crystals on the SU(1,1) coherent-state manifold. In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a Möbius isometry on the Poincaré disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex projective Hilbert space. This framework offers an intuitive view of stability and topology in quantum photonic time crystals.

## 54. First operation of poly(ethylene naphthalate) enclosures for high-purity germanium detectors in liquid argon for $^{42}$K/$^{42}$Ar mitigation

**作者**: Christoph Vogl, Tommaso Comellato, Konstantin Gusev, Brennan Hackett, Patrick Krause, Andreas Leonhardt, Bela Majorovits, Niko N. P. N. Lay, Moritz Neuberger, Nadezda Rumyantseva, Mario Schwarz, Michael Willers, Stefan Schönert

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17324.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17324.pdf)

**摘要**: Commercial argon contains cosmogenic $^{42}$Ar whose progeny $^{42}$K is a critical background component for the Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless $\beta \beta$ Decay (LEGEND). LEGEND operates High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors bare in liquid argon. $^{42}$K is attracted by the HPGe detectors' electric fields, and drifts toward the germanium surface, where it undergoes beta decay. LEGEND-1000 will mitigate $^{42}$K-induced background by using underground-sourced argon, depleted in cosmogenic isotopes. If underground argon is not available, mitigation techniques must be employed. Poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) enclosures were proposed to hinder the ion drift, decrease the beta-particle's energy, and produce scintillation light. In this paper, we report on operating two HPGe detectors, both bare and PEN-enclosed, in $^{42}$Ar-enriched liquid argon, and find no evidence for deterioration of energy stability or resolution due to the enclosures. We monitor the beta and gamma rates of $^{42}$K, find complex time-dependencies extending to roughly 30 days after applying the HPGe detectors' high-voltage, and qualitatively demonstrate the $^{42}$K suppression capabilities of enclosures.

## 55. High system efficiency nonlinear frequency conversion on thin-film lithium niobate

**作者**: Philipp Lohmann, Daniel Wendland, Francesco Lenzini, Wolfram H.P. Pernice

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17327.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17327.pdf)

**摘要**: Integrated photonic platforms can greatly enhance the efficiency of nonlinear frequency conversion processes by tightly confining light on a sub-micron scale. However, this advantage is often reduced by large fiber-to-chip coupling losses which drastically reduce the overall performance. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient thin-film lithium niobate frequency converter based on periodically poled waveguides combined with direct laser written out-of-plane couplers. Including on-chip and fiber-to-chip losses we obtain a conversion efficiency of 152 %/W, thus demonstrating a promising approach for future scalable integrated devices.

## 56. Investigating the growth cycles of titania and carbonaceous nano dusty plasmas

**作者**: Bhavesh Ramkorun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17395.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17395.pdf)

**摘要**: Solid nanoparticles which range in size from 1 to 500 nm can spontaneously grow from reactive gaseous precursors in nonthermal plasmas. This dissertation studies the particle size, and growth time with and without a background magnetic field in the plasma. Traditionally, studies have focused on the growth of either carbonaceous or silicate dust from either acetylene or silane, respectively. However, recently, there have been a shift towards studying new kinds of dust. For example, recent studies have grown polymers and metallic dust. This dissertation first introduces and studies the growth of titanium dioxide dust from the metal-organic vapor precursor of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The as-grown materials are amorphous but high temperature annealing crystallizes the samples into anatase and subsequently rutile. Then, the growth of titania dusty plasma is and compared to the growth of carbonaceous dust from acetylene, in argon plasma. They are grown during the presence and absence of weak magnetic fields of 500 Gauss. Both kinds of dust growth exhibit a growth cycle, which had already been shown for various nano dusty plasma. This occurs because once the dust accumulates a critical radius and mass, they move away from the central region of the plasma, allowing a new generation of growth begins. Ultimately, the new generation of growth also moves away leading to a continuous cycle of particle formation and transport as long as the plasma is on. However, with the presence of the magnetic field, the cycle time decreases, and the spatial distribution of the dust cloud appears differently. Finally, we focus on the growth cycle time of carbonaceous dust and how it decreases with a gradual increase in magnetic field, varying from 20 - 1000 Gauss. We particularly noticed a minimum at 330 Gauss, which coincides with electron magnetization.

**作者**: Ziqian Yao, Heather Chang, Eric Stolt, Clarissa Daniel, Tzu-Hsuan Hsu, Juan Rivas-Davila, Ruochen Lu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17431.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17431.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we demonstrate the first two-port radial-mode Rosen transformer based on 36$^{\circ}$Y-cut lithium niobate (LN) for piezoelectric power conversion. The device achieves a high transformation ratio (TF) of 16, a high electromechanical coupling factor ($k^2$) of 16.8\% and a quality factor ($Q$) of 2500, yielding an outstanding figure of merit (FoM = $Q \cdot k^2$) of 420. The fabricated transformer features a large effective turns ratio of 16 and delivers an open-circuit voltage gain of 45.56 (unloaded) and 40.57 with a load of 1 M$\Omega$ in parallel with 0.1 pF, validating its ability to provide efficient passive voltage amplification. An equivalent circuit model was developed to accurately fit both finite-element-simulated and measured admittance spectra, enabling reliable parameter extraction. These results establish LN radial-mode resonators as a promising high-performance, magnetic-less transformer platform.

## 58. Circulation of Elites in an Adaptive Network Model

**作者**: Alexander Jochim, Stefan Bornholdt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17434.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17434.pdf)

**摘要**: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.

## 59. Laminar and Turbulent Flow in Wavy Pipes under Strong Wall Modulations

**作者**: Ismail El Mellas, Juan J. Hidalgo, Marco Dentz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17458.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17458.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate laminar and turbulent flow in pipes with periodically varying cross-sections, using direct numerical simulations over a range of Reynolds numbers between 1-5300. Pipe diameters are sinusoidally modulated in the axial direction, resulting in constrictions that reduce the local pipe radius by up to 40 percent. Such pronounced geometric roughness is encountered across disciplines, but is particularly relevant to karst systems, where dissolution-driven wall deformation leads to strong cross-sectional variability. Unlike classical roughness studies that assume small, homogeneous wall perturbations, the present configuration introduces large-scale axial variations that significantly affect flow structure, separation behaviour, and pressure drop even in the laminar regime. Once a critical roughness is exceeded, flow reversal appears at Reynolds numbers smaller than $25$, inducing local recirculation zones and significantly increasing friction. These effects are not captured by classical models based solely on bulk geometric parameters, but require the definition of an effective hydraulic radius. Furthermore, the strong wall-induced mixing promotes an early transitions to turbulence in a Reynolds range between 500 and 1000, well below the classical threshold for smooth pipes. At higher roughness, the influence of Reynolds number becomes increasingly hidden by geometric effects, as the flow is dominated by inertial separation and wall-induced disturbances. The peak-to-peak amplitude provides a robust estimator for the equivalent sandgrain roughness. These findings emphasise the limitations of traditional friction laws in geometrically complex conduits and point to the need for new models that account for the interplay between large-scale roughness and inertial effects.

## 60. Cold Pools Reduce the Impacts of Deforestation on Convection Initiation

**作者**: Nicholas M. Falk, Gabrielle R. Leung, Leah D. Grant, Susan C. van den Heever

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17469.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17469.pdf)

**摘要**: The individual and synergistic impacts of cold pools and land surface heterogeneity on convection initiation are investigated. Idealized large eddy simulations of deep convection over the Amazon rainforest are conducted. Simulations test realistic and homogenized vegetation, along with realistic and suppressed low-level evaporation which eliminates cold pools. Updrafts are tracked to determine convection initiation locations. The aggregation of initiation locations is quantified with an organization index. Initiation locations are randomly distributed over homogeneous vegetation, with or without cold pools, demonstrating that cold pools have minimal impacts on initiation locations over homogeneous vegetation. With realistic vegetation, convection initiation is more frequent over forested than deforested areas due to favorable thermodynamics. Heterogeneous vegetation effectively aggregates initiation locations and precipitation compared to homogeneous vegetation, whereas cold pools disaggregate initiation locations and precipitation by propagating into deforested regions and initiating convection. Thus, cold pools partially counteract the effects of anthropogenically driven land surface heterogeneity.

## 61. Residual Stress Anisotropy In Thin-Film Lithium Niobate For Stress-Managed MEMS

**作者**: Byeongjin Kim, Ian Anderson, Tzu-Hsuan Hsu, Ziqian Yao, Mihir Chaudhari, Sinwoo Cho, Ruochen Lu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17474.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17474.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we present the first experimental study of residual stress and post-release beam deflection in 128-degree Y-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on Si, revealing pronounced stress anisotropy with in-plane orientation. Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

## 62. Addressing A Posteriori Performance Degradation in Neural Network Subgrid Stress Models

**作者**: Andy Wu, Sanjiva K. Lele

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17475.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17475.pdf)

**摘要**: Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation.

## 63. Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening for Cross-Resolution Ecohydrological Modeling

**作者**: Long Jiang, Yang Yang, Morgan Thornwell, Tiantian Yang, Hoshin Vijai Gupta

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17482.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17482.pdf)

**摘要**: Ecohydrological models are increasingly applied across multiple scenarios, yet their application remains constrained by high computational costs of fine-resolution simulations and structural inconsistencies in cross-scale modeling. This study develops a Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening (SFCC) framework that preserves both hydrological connectivity and functional heterogeneity during model input coarsening. We apply the VELMA model to 24 subbasins in the Salish Sea Basin, U.S. and examine three types of inputs: (i) DEM coarsened with a Hydro-aware approach that preserves drainage topology; (ii) land-use and soil-type datasets coarsened with function-preserving methods (Auto-weight and Auto-reassign) that retain small but process-dominant classes; and (iii) initial conditions coarsened with hydrology-, land-cover-, and soil-aware strategies to enhance temporal stability. Results show that the Hydro-aware method effectively preserves watershed morphology and yields more consistent runoff and nitrate predictions than mean-based coarsening across scales. For categorical inputs, the function-preserving methods alleviate the dominant-class bias of majority aggregation, particularly in basins where small high-impact patches drive nitrogen export. Long-term simulations further show that although hydrological variables equilibrate rapidly and biogeochemical processes adjust more gradually, deviations in both decrease over time and converge toward a steady state. These demonstrate that structural consistency and functional preservation together maintain dynamic stability through spatiotemporal feedback. Compared with existing work, the proposed SFCC framework operates directly at the data-input level, enabling more coherent integration of multi-source datasets and maximizing the retention of high-resolution information.

## 64. Ultrafast optical Kerr Gate at 1 GHz repetition rate by focusing on BBS glass

**作者**: Amr Farrag, Assegid M. Flatae, Lenorah M. Stott, Alessandro Jagatti, Andrea Lapini, Doris Möncke, Mario Agio

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17493.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17493.pdf)

**摘要**: Efficient detection of ultrafast phenomena is central to modern optical sciences, driving advances in quantum science and technology, physical chemistry, and nanophotonics. When processes occur on sub-picosecond timescales, time-resolved methods such as transient absorption, up-conversion, and optical Kerr gating (OKG) can be utilized to probe these dynamics, though they are typically applied to ensembles rather than single emitters. The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs. BBS glass was selected for its high nonlinear coefficient, which enhances detection efficiency, sub-ps response time, and its compatibility with standard microscopy platforms.

## 65. Learning of Statistical Field Theories

**作者**: Shreya Shukla, Abhijith Jayakumar, Andrey Y. Lokhov

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09859.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09859.pdf)

**摘要**: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.

## 66. Navigating the Quantum Resource Landscape of Entropy Vector Space Using Machine Learning and Optimization

**作者**: Nothando Khumalo, Aman Mehta, William Munizzi, Prineha Narang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16724.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16724.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16738.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16738.pdf)

**摘要**: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.

## 68. Light-Induced Lattice Coherence and Emission Enhancement in PTM-Passivated CsSnI3 Perovskites

**作者**: Thomas Y. Adams, Bruce Barrios, Michael Ziegenfus, Hui Cai, Sayantani Ghosh

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16770.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16770.pdf)

**摘要**: Metal halide perovskites continue to lead in optoelectronic applications, but the toxicity of lead has driven efforts to identify environmentally benign alternatives. Cesium tin iodide is one such, with a direct bandgap and near-infrared emission, though its performance is limited by instability. We show that phthalimide (PTM) passivation during single crystal growth enhances optical output and ambient stability. Under continuous excitation, PTM-passivated microscale crystals show up to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, accompanied by reversible sharpening of a low-frequency Raman mode associated with Cs rattling. This reveals dynamic, light-induced lattice reordering that passivates trap states and enhances radiative recombination. Mechanical grinding yields nanocrystals with redshifted, narrowed PL, consistent with a relaxed polymorph and reduced inhomogeneous broadening. Despite increased surface area, PTM remains effective in preserving near-infrared emission in nanocrystals as well. Power-dependent PL reveals distinct carrier dynamics, where microcrystals show redshift due to bandgap renormalization, while nanocrystals show blueshift and elevated carrier temperatures (300 to 1900 K), consistent with hot-carrier recombination. Extended illumination reveals reversible optical changes, including PL modulation, reflecting dynamic light-matter interactions and evolving defect landscapes. These results identify PTM-passivated Cesium tin iodide as an ideal platform for probing morphology-dependent carrier relaxation and light-induced vibrational coherence in lead-free perovskites.

## 69. Computer Simulation of Gel Formation in Colloidal Systems of Sticky Rods

**作者**: Johannes Krotz

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16872.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16872.pdf)

**摘要**: We develop and validate a simulation framework for colloidal gelation. We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application.

## 70. Exploring the Cosmological Model Degeneracy with a new evaluate factor G

**作者**: Yuan-bo Xie, Yun-dong Wu, Wei Hong, Tong-jie Zhang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16944.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16944.pdf)

**摘要**: In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.

**摘要**: Characterising optical quantum states is essential for the development of quantum technologies. While traditional approaches to perform full quantum state tomography are often experimentally demanding, neuromorphic architectures may provide an effective alternative. In this work, we demonstrate how a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode is sufficient to act as a quantum reservoir. By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.

**摘要**: Radio-frequency (RF) sputtering is a low-cost technique for the deposition of large-area single-phase AlInN on silicon layers with application in photovoltaic devices. Here, the effect of the Al mole fraction x from 0 to 0.56 on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of $n$ Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N layers deposited at 550 $^\circ$C on p-Si(100) by RF sputtering is studied. X-ray diffraction data show a wurtzite structure oriented along the c-axis in all samples, where the full width at half maximum of the rocking curve around the InN (0002) diffraction peak decreases from $\sim 9^\circ$ to $\sim 3^\circ$ while incorporating Al to the AlInN layer. The rootmean-square surface roughness, estimated from atomic force microscopy, evolves from 20 nm for InN to 1.5 nm for Al$_{0.56}$In$_{0.44}$N. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show a blueshift of the emission energy from 1.59 eV (779 nm) for InN to 1.82 eV (681 nm) for Al$_{0.35}$In$_{0.65}$N according to the Al content rise. Hall effect measurements of Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N ($0<x <0.35$) on sapphire samples grown simultaneously point to a residual n-type carrier concentration in the 1021 cm$^{-3}$ range. The developed n-AlInN/p-Si junctions present promising material properties to explore their performance operating as solar cell devices.

**摘要**: Transparent glass ceramics, when activated by rare earth ions, are excellent photonic materials. Regarding photonic glass-ceramics based on silicates, hafnia and silica in a binary system has proved to be an excellent matrix to incorporate rare earth ions in the hafnia nanocrystals, resulting in important luminescence enhancement and, consequently, allowing a large spectrum of critical applications. Here we will focus on the downconversion mechanism driven by the couple Tb3+/Yb3+, largely exploited in photovoltaic systems. The research presented here has been performed on 70SiO2-30HfO2 silica-hafnia glass-ceramic films activated with 19 % rare earth ions: [Tb + Yb]/[Si + Hf] = 19 %. Two main results will be discussed: (a) the intensity and the broadening of the Yb3+ emission band at 975 nm were found to be temperature-dependent, as shown in the figure; (b) the energy transfer mechanism Tb3+ >> Yb3+ will be discussed, referring to the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. In relation to the latter topic, the power dependence spectra for the luminescence of Yb3+: 2F5/2 >> 2F7/2 will be discussed.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17126.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17126.pdf)

**摘要**: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at this https URL.

**作者**: Daniel Benedicto Orenes, Naudson Lucas Lopes Matias, Apoorva Apoorva, Antoine Glicenstein, Raphaël Saint-Jalm, Robin Kaiser

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17187.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17187.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work we present a numerical and experimental investigation of the collective early-time decay rates of a strongly driven and optically dense cold atomic cloud. We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $\Omega$ that go from the weak $\Omega \ll \Gamma$ to the strong driving regime $\Omega \gg \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study.

**摘要**: We argue how AI can assist mathematics in three ways: theorem-proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and theoretical physics in 2017, we summarize how this emerging field has grown over the past years, and show how various machine-learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines in the mathematical sciences. At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.

## 77. Generating transition states of chemical reactions via distance-geometry-based flow matching

**作者**: Yufei Luo, Xiang Gu, Jian Sun

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17229.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17229.pdf)

**摘要**: Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.

## 78. Optical Entanglement Facilitated by Opto-Mechanical Cooling

**作者**: Alexandr V. Karpenko, Andrey B. Matsko, Sergey P. Vyatchanin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17244.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17244.pdf)

**摘要**: Optomechanical generation of entangled optical beams is usually hindered by thermal noise. We present a theoretical study of low frequency entanglement generation between two optical harmonics emitted from a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved-sideband regime. The system comprises three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, with the central mode coherently driven. This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.

## 79. Molecular insight on ultra-confined ionic transport in wetting films: the key role of friction

**作者**: Aymeric Allemand, Anne-Laure Biance, Christophe Ybert, Laurent Joly

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17257.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17257.pdf)

**摘要**: Nanofluidic transport is ubiquitous in natural systems from extra-cellular communication in biology to geological phenomena, and promotes the emergence of new technologies such as energy harvesting and water desalination. While experimental access to ultraconfined fluids has advanced rapidly, their behavior challenges conventional theoretical descriptions based on Poisson-Boltzmann theory or the Stokes equation whose possible extension remains an open question. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ionic transport within wetting films of water confined on silica surfaces down to the sub-nanometer scale. We then analyze these results using a simple one-dimensional theoretical framework. Remarkably, we show that this model remains valid even at confinement close to the molecular scale. Our results reveal that the dynamic of ion plays a key role in ionic transports, through ion adsorption at the water-silica interface. Adsorbed cations do not participate in ionic conduction, but instead generate molecular-scale roughness and transmit additional frictional forces to the substrate. This mechanism produces an apparent viscosity increase in electrostatically driven flows, reaching up to four times the bulk value in the case of potassium. Our findings highlight the critical role of interfacial ion adsorption in nanoscale hydrodynamics and provide new insights for interpreting experiments and designing nanofluidic systems.

## 80. Enhancing Infrared Laser Dissociation of Molecules with the Electromagnetic Vacuum

**作者**: Johan F. Triana, Felipe Herrera

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17278.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17278.pdf)

**摘要**: Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.

## 81. A First Full Physics Benchmark for Highly Granular Calorimeter Surrogates

**作者**: Thorsten Buss, Henry Day-Hall, Frank Gaede, Gregor Kasieczka, Katja Krüger, Anatolii Korol, Thomas Madlener, Peter McKeown

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17293.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17293.pdf)

**摘要**: The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17318.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17318.pdf)

**摘要**: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.

## 83. Is Phase Really Needed for Weakly-Supervised Dereverberation ?

**作者**: Marius Rodrigues, Louis Bahrman, Roland Badeau, Gaël Richard

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17346.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17346.pdf)

**摘要**: In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.

## 84. Learning Latent Transmission and Glare Maps for Lens Veiling Glare Removal

**作者**: Xiaolong Qian, Qi Jiang, Lei Sun, Zongxi Yu, Kailun Yang, Peixuan Wu, Jiacheng Zhou, Yao Gao, Yaoguang Ma, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Kaiwei Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17353.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17353.pdf)

**摘要**: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at this https URL.

## 85. DoS Dos and Don'ts

**作者**: Lucas Warwaruk, Konstantinos Zinelis, Randy H. Ewoldt, Christopher W. Macosko, Gareth H. McKinley

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17360.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17360.pdf)

**摘要**: Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) rheometry is a well-established method for measuring the extensional rheology of low-viscosity liquids. However, clear guidelines on the capabilities and limitations of the technique are lacking. In the present work, we define operational limits for measuring a transient extensional viscosity directly from observation of the rate of filament thinning, as well as model-based bounds on calculating a viscosity $\eta$ and extensional relaxation time $\tau_E$ of a liquid using DoS. Dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to probe the lower limit of measurable $\tau_E$, demonstrating that values as low as 0.1 ms can be resolved, provided (a) the intrinsic Deborah number (based on the ratio of the relaxation time and the Rayleigh breakup time scale) is $De \geq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and (b) an instrumental constraint related to spatial and temporal resolution is satisfied. This instrumental constraint is quantified through a new metric we define as the \textit{filament capture rate}, a ``figure of merit'' (expressed in Hz) that can be used to quantify the number of data points within the elasto-capillary regime that are available for extraction of $\tau_E$. We also investigate the sensitivity to other experimental parameters including variations in nozzle radius and Bond number ($Bo$). Across the tested range ($0.2 < Bo < 0.7$), extensional relaxation times for the same fluid vary by less than $\pm16$ \%; however, experiments with low viscosity fluids at $Bo > 0.5$ exhibit damped gravitational oscillations that affect early-time dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative roadmap for reliable DoS rheometry and affirm its use for measuring sub-millisecond relaxation times in weakly elastic fluids.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17390.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17390.pdf)

**摘要**: The problem of a single Hermitian impurity has long served as a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, offering fundamental insights into the mechanisms of Anderson localization. Yet, despite the increased interest in the spectral and localization properties of non-Hermitian lattices with defects, the non-Hermitian extension of the single impurity problem remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the role of a single complex impurity in one-, two-, and three-dimensional infinite tight-binding lattices. Our study reveals a series of counterintuitive phenomena, including regions where localization vanishes and re-emerges as the impurity strength varies. Next, we study the corresponding finite-sized lattices, which are highly relevant to experimental realizations in readily accessible photonic platforms, revealing a variety of exotic features, such as scale-free localized states, exceptional points, and peculiar cross-shaped localized eigenstates, whose profiles deviate from the conventional exponential localization. This work paves the way for future studies on transport phenomena in non-Hermitian disordered lattices.

## 87. Auxiliary many-body wavefunctions for TDDFRT electronic excited states: Consequences for the representation of molecular electronic transitions

**作者**: Jérémy Morere, Enzo Monino, Thibaud Etienne

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13616.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13616.pdf)

**摘要**: This contribution reports the study of a set of molecular electronic-structure reorganization representations related to light-induced electronic transitions, modeled in the framework of time-dependent density-functional response theory. More precisely, the work related in this paper deals with the consequences, for the electronic transitions natural-orbital characterization, that are inherent to the use of auxiliary many-body wavefunctions constructed a posteriori and assigned to excited states - since time-dependent density-functional response theory does not provide excited state ansatze in its native formulation. Three types of such auxiliary many-body wavefunctions are studied, and the structure and spectral properties of the relevant matrices (the one-electron reduced difference and transition density matrices) is discussed and compared with the native equation-of-motion time-dependent density functional response theory picture of an electronic transition - we see for instance that within this framework the detachment and attachment density matrices can be derived without diagonalizing the one-body reduced difference density matrix. The common ''departure/arrival'' wavefunction-based representations of electronic transitions are also extensively discussed.

## 88. Flamelet Connection to Turbulence Kinetic Energy Dissipation Rate

**作者**: William A. Sirignano, Wes Hellwig, Sylvain L. Walsh

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04929.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04929.pdf)

**摘要**: The turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate $\epsilon$, from a turbulent combustion computation using either Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES), is proposed for closure with a sub-grid non-premixed flamelet model. The intentions are to avoid the creation of artificial tracking or progress variables and to relate accurately the physics of turbulent non-premixed combustion at the resolved length scales to the small-scale physics where the mixing and chemical reactions occur. The analysis addresses the relations between $\epsilon$ and the strain rate, vorticity, viscous dissipation rate, scalar gradients, scalar dissipation rate, and burning rate at the smallest turbulence length scales where diffusion-controlled burning is faster than at larger length scales and thereby dominant. The imposed strain rate and vorticity on these smallest eddies are determined from the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Thus, an $\epsilon$ value at a specific time and location determines the two mechanical constraints (vorticity and strain rate) on the inflow to the counterflow flamelet. $\epsilon$ affects the sign of the Laplacian of pressure, which must be negative to allow the existence of the counterflow. Using different flamelet models, with and without vorticity, different results for maximum flamelet temperature, integrated flamelet burning rate, and maximum flamelet scalar dissipation rate are obtained. Flamelet models that consider the centrifugal effect of vorticity produce substantial enhancements in the accuracy and completeness of information for a turbulent combustion computation. $\epsilon$ may be used as a tracking variable that connects the sub-grid flamelet model to resolved-scale RANS or LES computations.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16824.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16824.pdf)

**摘要**: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. These structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around (30 - 40, R_sun) and decreasing farther out. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta (beta <= 1) environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 R_sun), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfvénic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures, unlike most near-Sun solar wind fluctuations, exhibit sunward-directed Alfvénic polarization in the plasma frame. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfvénic solar wind. While these structures might be Alfvénic solitons, vortices, or flux ropes, we refrain from a definitive classification pending further evidence. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.

## 90. The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a General Relativity University Course

**作者**: Matteo Tuveri, Andrea Pierfrancesco Sanna, Mariano Cadoni

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08564.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08564.pdf)

**摘要**: Effective physics learning, especially in complex topics, requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality, and using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. This study explores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex topics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. We present a case study conducted at the University of Cagliari in 2021 and 2022, examining how students construct problem frames and how this influences their conceptual understanding of GR. Findings indicate that students who effectively integrate conceptual reasoning with mathematical formalism demonstrate a deeper grasp of physical principles and enhanced problem-solving capabilities. The research underscores the importance of symbol sense and the iterative nature of problem framing, suggesting that an integrated approach - combining visual, symbolic, and natural language representations - can improve students' conceptual engagement. Furthermore, the methodology offers instructors valuable insights into students' thinking processes, supporting more effective and targeted feedback.

## 91. Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators

**作者**: Caifeng Zou, Zachary E. Ross, Robert W. Clayton, Fan-Chi Lin, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15013.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15013.pdf)

**摘要**: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. State-of-the-art optimization techniques built into PyTorch provide neural operators with greater flexibility to improve the optimization dynamics of full waveform inversion, thereby mitigating cycle-skipping problems. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24363.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24363.pdf)

**摘要**: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.

**摘要**: This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. The activity engaged students in collaborative exploration using a "black box" as an analogical model of the atom. Grounded in constructivist theory and the Focus Action-Reflection (FAR) model to introduce analogies in the in-class context, we explore how analogical reasoning can support high school students in understanding the atomic structure. Data from student worksheets, graphical representations, and group discussions were analyzed using thematic, phenomenographic, and conceptual metaphor analysis. Results indicate that students were able to develop and refine analogical models, reason from empirical evidence, and engage in critical reflection on the epistemological limits of the analogy. While students demonstrated conceptual gains and collaborative problem-solving, the analysis also revealed persistent risks of reifying metaphors or overextending macroscopic analogies to quantum domains. These findings highlight the value - and limitations - of structured analogical modeling in contemporary physics education, and point to the need for teacher training that fosters epistemological awareness and reflective use of models in the classroom.

**摘要**: femtoPro is an interactive virtual reality (VR) laser laboratory balancing the contrasting challenges of accuracy and computational efficiency in optics simulations. It can simulate linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in real time, a task that pushes the boundaries of current consumer hardware. This paper details the concept, implementation, and evaluation of a dynamic graph-based solution tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of the simulation. Resource usage is optimized through a selective updating strategy that identifies and preserves laser paths unchanged between simulation frames, eliminating the need for unnecessary recalculations. Benchmarking of real-world scenarios confirms that our approach delivers a smooth user experience, even on mobile VR platforms with limited computing power. The methodologies, solutions and insights outlined in this paper may be applicable to other interactive, dynamic graph-based real-time simulations.

## 95. A Planar Huygens Antenna Utilizing Crossed Electric and Magnetic Dipoles

**作者**: Muhammad Rizwan Akram, Abbas Semnani

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24845.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24845.pdf)

**摘要**: The natural source of a magnetic dipole in antennas is typically an electrically small loop, which can be utilized in conjunction with an electric dipole to realize an electrically small Huygens' antenna. However, these antennas suffer from low radiation efficiency and their theoretical directivity limit is 4.8 dBi. Magnetic dipoles with an electrical size larger than 0.5lambda are highly desirable for high-gain applications. This paper builds on the development of a magnetic dipole source that utilizes a 0.5lambda slot positioned near a printed dipole with a length twice that of the slot. Such a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles yields a highly directive radiation pattern, resulting in a higher gain than a uniformly illuminated antenna of similar size. The prototype is designed to operate at 4.5 GHz, with a directivity of up to 8.37 dBi. The analytical, numerical, and measured results agree fully. This high-gain superdirective antenna is highly desirable due to its excellent features, including being low-profile, PCB compatible, and having a low-complexity feeding topology, compared to the existing approach of the two-element end-fire array.

## 96. Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria

**作者**: Matt Russell

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05727.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05727.pdf)

**摘要**: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints.

## 97. Higher-order homogenised riblet boundary conditions

**作者**: Paolo Luchini, Daniel Chung

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22239.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22239.pdf)

**摘要**: The description of riblets and other drag-reducing devices has long used the concept of longitudinal and transverse protrusion heights, both as a means to predict the drag reduction itself and as equivalent boundary conditions to simplify numerical simulations by transferring the effect of riblets onto a flat virtual boundary. The limitation of this idea is that it stems from a first-order approximation in the riblet-size parameter $s^+$, and as a consequence it cannot predict other than a linear dependence of drag reduction upon $s^+$; in other words, the initial slope of the drag-reduction curve. Here the concept is extended to a full asymptotic expansion using matched asymptotics, which consistently provides higher-order protrusion coefficients and higher-order equivalent boundary conditions on a virtual flat surface. While the majority of our results, though nonlinear in $s^+$, remain linear in velocity, and therefore we shall not directly address the shape of the drag-reduction curve, this procedure will also allow us to explore the way nonlinearities of the Navier-Stokes equations first enter the $s^+$-expansion, with somewhat surprising negative results.

## 98. Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation

**作者**: K. Z. Nanjo, T. Hori, D. Iwata

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21478.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21478.pdf)

**摘要**: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.

## 99. Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data

**作者**: Alberto Almuna-Morales, Danilo Aballay, Pierre Gélat, Reza Haqshenas, Elwin van 't Wout

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11100.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11100.pdf)

**摘要**: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.

## 100. Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario

**作者**: Veljko Janković

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14447.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14447.pdf)

**摘要**: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume that the carrier's hopping amplitude is modulated by a single undamped vibration. The modulation is, however, by many low-frequency modes, whose net effect can be approximated using a few effective damped oscillators. Here, we employ the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute the finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of the assumed delta-like phonon spectrum and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.

## 101. Monte Carlo simulation method for incoherent Thomson scattering spectra from arbitrary electron distribution functions

**作者**: Kentaro Sakai, Kentaro Tomita, Takeo Hoshi, Ryo Yasuhara

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20627.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20627.pdf)

**摘要**: We developed a Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate incoherent Thomson scattering spectra in high temperature plasmas. The basic idea is to treat the entire scattering process as the superposition of individual photon-electron interactions. We introduce macro-particles, referred from particle-in-cell simulations, to reduce the computational cost, and obtain scattered spectra within a reasonable computational time. Since the velocity of the interacting electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an appropriate sampling scheme is available. We present simulation results for relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions, and compare them with both analytical and numerical spectra for validation. The simulated spectra show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo simulation method can reliably reproduce incoherent Thomson scattering spectra.

## 102. Physical interactions enable energy-efficient Turing patterns

**作者**: Cathelijne ter Burg, David Zwicker

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05093.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05093.pdf)

**摘要**: Patterns are ubiquitous in nature, but how they form is often unclear. Turing developed a seminal theory to explain patterns based on reactions that counteract the equalizing tendency of diffusion. These reactions require continuous energy input since the system otherwise would proceed to equilibrium, but what systems are energy-efficient is currently unclear. To address this question, we introduce a thermodynamically-consistent model of a Turing system. We reveal that repulsive interactions between the stereotypical activator and inhibitor reduce energy requirements significantly. Interestingly, efficient patterns occur for weak activity, albeit at reduced amplitude. Our results suggest that physical interactions might be central in forming natural patterns.

## 103. A Geometrically Consistent Matching Framework for Side-Scan Sonar Mapping

**作者**: Can Lei, Hayat Rajani, Nuno Gracias, Rafael Garcia, Huigang Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11255.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11255.pdf)

**摘要**: Robust matching of side-scan sonar imagery remains a fundamental challenge in seafloor mapping due to view-dependent backscatter, shadows, and geometric distortion. This paper proposes a novel matching framework that combines physical decoupling and geometric consistency to enhance correspondence accuracy and consistency across viewpoints. A multi-branch network, derived from the Lambertian reflection model, decomposes raw sonar images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. The reflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction with a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA-LightGlue. Geometry-aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation and its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in acoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby improving registration accuracy. Quantitative and visual evaluations against traditional, CNN-, and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our method achieves lower matching error, higher geometric consistency, and greater robustness to viewpoint variations. The proposed approach provides a data-efficient, physically interpretable solution for high-precision side-scan sonar image matching in complex seafloor environments.

## 104. Helical Core Formation and MHD Stability in ITER-Scale Plasmas with Fusion-born Alpha Particles

**作者**: P. Adulsiriswad, A. Bierwage, M. Yagi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11749.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11749.pdf)

**摘要**: The effect of fusion-born alpha particles on the helical core (HC), a long-lived ideal saturation state of the $m/n=1/1$ kink/quasi-interchange mode, is studied in the ITER-scale hybrid scenario where a core plasma has a low magnetic shear $q\gtrsim1$. The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance and all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety factor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An incomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic axis, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$. Using MHD-PIC simulations, we find that $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ is enhanced by increasing alpha particle pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$. Within the ITER operating alpha pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0) \lesssim 1\%$, $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ can be approximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there is no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC preserves the omnigenity of the plasma. If one increases $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)$ beyond $1\%$, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ continues to increase with $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ until it reaches an upper limit at $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)=3\%$ for our reference case. At this limit, both the bulk and alpha pressure profiles are partially flattened, indicating a reduction in omnigenity. After HC formation, a resistive pressure-driven MHD mode can become unstable, which is localized along the compressed magnetic flux region of the HC. This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of short-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part of a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to adequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results suggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma confinement.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13171.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13171.pdf)

**摘要**: High-energy heavy-ion particle accelerators have long served as proxies for the harsh space radiation environment, enabling both fundamental life-science research and applied testing of flight hardware. Traditionally, monoenergetic high-energy heavy-ion beams have been employed for practicality, providing valuable datasets that underpin radiation risk and predictive computational models. However, such beams cannot fully reproduce the mixed-field nature of space radiation, motivating the development of realistic analogs for improved risk assessment and countermeasure evaluation in preparation for future deep-space missions to Moon or Mars. Spearheaded by developments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung, supported by the European Space Agency (ESA), has established advanced space radiation simulation capabilities in Europe. Here, we present the design, optimization, and in-silico benchmarking of GSI's hybrid active-passive Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) simulator, together with a computationally optimized phase-space particle source for Geant4, which is available to external users for their own simulation studies and experimental planning.

## 106. Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models

**作者**: Adrien Goldszal, Diego Calanzone, Vincent Taboga, Pierre-Luc Bacon

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19588.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19588.pdf)

**摘要**: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.

## 107. Linear Response Selected Configuration Interaction

**作者**: Peter Reinholdt, Erik Kjellgren, Jacob Kongsted

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02949.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02949.pdf)

**摘要**: In this work, we extend selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods beyond energies and expectation values by introducing a linear response (LR) framework for molecular response properties. Existing SCI approaches are capable of approximating the energy of the full configuration interaction (FCI) wave function with high accuracy but at a much lower cost. However, conventional determinant selection will, by design, mainly select determinants that are expected to improve energies, and this can lead to the omission of many determinants that are important for wave function response. We address this by introducing two new selection criteria motivated by linear response theory. Using these extended determinant selection criteria, we demonstrate that LR-SCI can systematically converge toward the FCI limit for static polarizabilities. Using a damped LR formulation, we compute the water K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum in active spaces up to (10e, 58o). Finally, we use LR-SCI to compute NMR spin-spin coupling constants for water, where we find that accuracy beyond that offered by CCSDT can be achieved. Overall, LR-SCI offers a promising route to compute response properties with near-FCI accuracy to systems beyond the reach of exact FCI.

**摘要**: This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.

## 109. In-Situ Performance of FBK VUV-HD3 and HPK VUV4 SiPMs in the LoLX Liquid Xenon Detector

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15270.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15270.pdf)

**摘要**: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a critical technology for the next generation of rare-event search experiments using liquid xenon (LXe). While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.

## 110. Towards a mobile quantitative phase imaging microscope with smartphone phase-detection sensors

**作者**: Xiangjiang Bao, Lucas Kreiss, Josh Lerner, Roarke Horstmeyer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27662.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27662.pdf)

**摘要**: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables visualization and quantitative extraction of the optical phase information of transparent samples. However, conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\times2$ pixel group. The phase gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens, which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.

## 111. Quaternion wavefunction formulation of incompressible inviscid fluid dynamics

**作者**: Farrukh A. Chishtie

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07469.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07469.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a quaternion wavefunction formulation that reduces the incompressible Euler equations to a single nonlinear Schrödinger-type equation. The velocity field emerges from a complex quaternion wavefunction $\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H}$ satisfying a constrained Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with incompressibility enforced through a holomorphic constraint on quaternion space. This formulation preserves all conservation laws through a natural Lagrangian structure and reduces the system from four coupled nonlinear equations (three velocity components plus pressure) to one quaternion field equation with an algebraic constraint. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving analytical solutions for three-dimensional flow past a sphere, obtaining the Newton regime drag coefficient $C_{D,\infty} = 0.44$ from pure quaternion topology (achieving $C_D = 0.488$ at Reynolds number $\text{Re} = 1000$, within $3.8\%$ of experimental measurements) and establishing topological consistency with the experimentally observed onset of vortex shedding at $\text{Re}_c = 270$ through quaternion circulation quantization. The formulation provides a new mathematical framework for inviscid fluid dynamics and suggests efficient numerical algorithms exploiting quaternion structure.

**摘要**: Generalized friendship paradoxes occur when, on average, our friends have more of some attribute than us. These paradoxes are relevant to many aspects of human interaction, notably in social science and epidemiology. Here, we derive new theoretical results concerning the inevitability of a paradox arising, using a linear algebra perspective. Following the seminal 1991 work of Scott L. Feld, we consider two distinct ways to measure and compare averages, which may be regarded as global and local. For global averaging, we show that a generalized friendship paradox holds for a large family of walk-based centralities, including Katz centrality and total subgraph communicability, and also for nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality. Defining loneliness as the reciprocal of the number of friends, we show that for this attribute the generalized friendship paradox always holds in reverse. In this sense, we are always more lonely, on average, than our friends. We also derive a global averaging paradox result for the case where the arithmetic mean is replaced by the geometric mean. The nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality paradox is also established for the case of local averaging.

## 113. Classical timing noise in gravity-mediated entanglement tests: LOCC structure, metrological bounds, and visibility thresholds

**作者**: Yaghmorassene Hebib

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11879.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11879.pdf)

**摘要**: Table-top proposals to test gravity-mediated entanglement aim to distinguish coherent gravitational interactions from classical dephasing processes that generate identical phases on both interferometers. A particularly important contribution is platform-invariant timing noise, which can be accessed through optical-clock cross-spectra and frequency-transfer links. In this work we (i) derive the mapping from clock cross-spectra to an effective common-mode dephasing rate, (ii) show that the corresponding dynamical channel is LOCC and therefore unable to generate entanglement, and (iii) combine published clock and interferometer noise floors to obtain quantitative bounds on the ratio between common-mode and local dephasing rates in representative gravity-entanglement proposals. Across QGEM-, MAQRO-, and levitated-nanoparticle regimes we find a robust hierarchy $\gamma_{\rm com}/\gamma_{\rm loc}\sim10^{-9}$--$10^{-11}$, identifying platform-invariant timing noise as a negligible but calibratable background. We further derive visibility and Bell--CHSH thresholds in the presence of both common-mode and local dephasing, and illustrate the full calibration workflow with a simple synthetic example anchored to state-of-the-art clock metrology. Extended derivations and statistical tools are provided in the Supplemental Material.

## 114. Easy-access online social media metrics can foster the identification of misinformation sharing users

**作者**: Júlia Számely, Alessandro Galeazzi, Júlia Koltai, Elisa Omodei

**摘要**: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.

**摘要**: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is designed to utilize a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer, a positron transport system, and a positron detection system, to either discover or constrain this rare process with a conversion probability of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. This article presents an overview of the theoretical framework as well as a detailed description of the experimental design for the search for muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.

**摘要**: Using time-resolved infrared-vacuum-ultraviolet double-resonance spectroscopy, experimental room temperature measurements of state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer within the X $^1\Sigma^+(v=2)$ vibrational state of CO due to H$_2$ collisions have been compared to accurate 4-D close-coupling quantum calculations. Theoretically predicted quantum interferences in the CO-H$_2$ collisional system are experimentally observed for the first time at room temperature, and excellent agreement between theory and experiment is observed. These results provide a valuable benchmark for validating the anisotropic part of the potential energy surface, thereby supporting the theoretical modeling of CO emission in warm astrophysical environments such as photodissociation regions.

**摘要**: Quantum gas mixtures offer a wide field of research, ranging from few-body physics of impurities to many-body physics with emergent long-range interactions and ultracold molecular gases. Achieving precision control of mixtures is much harder than for single-component gases and, consequently, the respective techniques are less developed. Here we report on a decisive step forward in this direction by realizing dissipationless and fully differential optical control of the motional degrees of freedom of one of the species without affecting the other. This is achieved in a novel Bose-Fermi mixture with extreme mass imbalance, erbium-166 and lithium-6. Our experiments pave the way to a new generation of precision many-body experiments with quantum gas mixtures with unprecedented long lifetimes and low temperatures.

## 118. Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets

**作者**: Slava G. Turyshev

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20236.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20236.pdf)

**摘要**: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR >= 5 per micro-pixel. We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals -- exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization -- each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular-resolution and photon-budget thresholds to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to <= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits -- but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens -- providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches heliocentric distances beyond >= 550 AU -- is uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. Once mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired, the SGL enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06337.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06337.pdf)

**摘要**: Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.
Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.
Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.
Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.

## 120. Nuclear Spin-Mediated Relaxation Mechanisms of the V$_{B}^-$ Center in hBN

**作者**: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Tobias Vogl, Viktor Ivády

**摘要**: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

## 121. Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers

**作者**: Vishwajeet Kumar, Ohad Shpielberg, Arnab Pal

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03449.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03449.pdf)

**摘要**: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.

## 122. Qumode-Based Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Excited States

**作者**: Rishab Dutta, Cameron Cianci, Alexander V. Soudackov, Yuchen Wang, Chuzhi Xu, David A. Mazziotti, Lea F. Santos, Victor S. Batista

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04727.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04727.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.

## 123. Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications

**作者**: A. A. Semenov, M. Klen, I. Pechonkin

**摘要**: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.

## 124. How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective

**作者**: Sihan Hu, Xiansheng Cai, Yuan Huang, Zhiyuan Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23629.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23629.pdf)

**摘要**: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12957.pdf)

**摘要**: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.

## 126. GLOBE: Accurate and Generalizable PDE Surrogates using Domain-Inspired Architectures and Equivariances

**作者**: Peter Sharpe

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15856.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15856.pdf)

**摘要**: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

## 127. Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles

**作者**: Bin Zheng, Zhongqiang Xiong, Changhao Li, Zhanglin Hou, Ziluo Zhang, Xinpeng Xu, Li-Shing Lin, Kenta Ishimoto, Kento Yasuda, Shigeyuki Komura

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16178.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16178.pdf)

**摘要**: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.
