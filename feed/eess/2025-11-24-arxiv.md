## 1. Revisiting Audio-language Pretraining for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation

**作者**: Wei-Cheng Tseng, Xuanru Zhou, Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Hao Zhang, Dong Yu

**摘要**: Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.

**作者**: Ali Tehranian, Jordan Budhu, Casey Perkowski, Lance Sookdeo, Kenneth H. Church, Garrett Harris, Carl Pfeiffer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16777.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16777.pdf)

**摘要**: A hemispherical multilayer wide-band (7-13 GHz) band-pass frequency selective surface (FSS) is reported. A new design technique based on a Goldberg discretization and unit cell scaling technique is introduced to accommodate the curved profile of the FSS. The FSS is additively manufactured by sequentially printing dielectric layers and metallic patterns until 3 patterned silver-ink surfaces are integrated within a 4.5 mm (${\lambda_0}/6$ at 10 GHz) thick ABS hemispherical radome. The diameter and the height of the realized hemispherical FSS are around $5{\lambda_0}$ and $3{\lambda_0}$ respectively. Measurements demonstrate a roughly 1.7 dB insertion loss in the passband and 15-20 dB rejection in the stop-band. Additionally, a new postprocessing technique is used to suppress the effects of edge diffraction in the measured transmission spectrum. The design process, manufacturing technique, and measurement postprocessing represent novel advancements enabling future conformal frequency selective surfaces.

**作者**: Arash Omidi, Tanmay Mishra, Mads R. Almassalkhi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16819.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16819.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a hybrid energy system (HES) experimental testbed developed at the University of Vermont to support prototyping and validation of advanced control and optimization strategies for grid services. The platform integrates hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation with a reconfigurable set of kilowatt-scale assets, including solar photovoltaic (PV), battery storage, an electrolyzer as a controllable load, and grid-tied inverters. A unified monitoring and communication architecture supports real-time data acquisition, model validation, and control implementation. The testbed's capabilities are demonstrated through a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) experiment in which a battery system participates in PV power smoothing.

## 4. Line-of-Sight Probability in Macrocells: Framework, Statistical Models, and Parametrization from Massive Real World Datasets in the USA

**作者**: Bassel Abou Ali Modad, Xin Yu, Yao-Yi Chiang, Andreas F. Molisch

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16827.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16827.pdf)

**摘要**: Accurate modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) probability is crucial for wireless channel description and coverage planning. The presence of a LOS impacts other channel characteristics such as pathloss, fading depth, delay- and angular spread, etc.. Existing models, although useful, are based on very limited datasets. In this paper, we establish a framework to produce high accuracy LOS models from geospatial data in different environments, and apply it to create a LOS model for macrocells, using datasets of the United States (US) on a nationalscale, using more than 13, 000 locations of real-world macrocells. Based on this we create a new, fully parameterized model that better describes macrocell deployments in the US than the 3GPP model. We furthermore demonstrate that for improved accuracy the LOS probability should be modeled on a per cell basis, and the model parameters treated as random variables; we provide a full description and parameterization of this novel approach and by simulations show that it better predicts the inter-cell interference at the cell-edge than an average-based model.

## 5. The PV performance ratio paradox: annual data from large-scale, real-world PV systems show negligible meteorological and technical impact and points to dominant human factors

**作者**: Hugo FM Milan, Aline Q Alves, Thatiane AT Souza, Juliana M Galo, Alex SC Maia, Moisés AP Borges, Ciro J Egoavil

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16834.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16834.pdf)

**摘要**: Performance ratio (PR) is a established measure of efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems. While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rondônia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rondônia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16854.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16854.pdf)

**摘要**: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: this https URL.

## 7. Avoiding Quality Saturation in UGC Compression Using Denoised References

**作者**: Xin Xiong, Samuel Fernández-Menduiña, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega, Neil Birkbeck, Balu Adsumilli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16876.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16876.pdf)

**摘要**: Video-sharing platforms must re-encode large volumes of noisy user-generated content (UGC) to meet streaming demands. However, conventional codecs, which aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the compressed and input videos, can cause quality saturation (QS) when applied to UGC, i.e., increasing the bitrate preserves input artifacts without improving visual quality. A direct approach to solve this problem is to detect QS by repeatedly evaluating a non-reference metric (NRM) on videos compressed with multiple codec parameters, which is inefficient. In this paper, we re-frame UGC compression and QS detection from the lens of noisy source coding theory: rather than using a NRM, we compute the MSE with respect to the denoised UGC, which serves as an alternative reference (D-MSE). Unlike MSE measured between the UGC input and the compressed UGC, D-MSE saturates at non-zero values as bitrates increase, a phenomenon we term distortion saturation (DS). Since D-MSE can be computed at the block level in the transform domain, we can efficiently detect D-MSE without coding and decoding with various parameters. We propose two methods for DS detection: distortion saturation detection (DSD), which relies on an input-dependent threshold derived from the D-MSE of the input UGC, and rate-distortion saturation detection (RDSD), which estimates the Lagrangian at the saturation point using a low-complexity compression method. Both methods work as a pre-processing step that can help standard-compliant codecs avoid QS in UGC compression. Experiments with AVC show that preventing encoding in the saturation region, i.e., avoiding encoding at QPs that result in QS according to our methods, achieves BD-rate savings of 8%-20% across multiple different NRMs, compared to a naïve baseline that encodes at the given input QP while ignoring QS.

## 8. State-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries using a tree seed and genetic algorithm-optimized generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based square root cubature Kalman filter

**作者**: Haiquan Zhao, Xiong Yin, Jinhui Hu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16888.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16888.pdf)

**摘要**: The cubature Kalman filter based on minimum error entropy (MEE-CKF) offers accurate and robust performance in state of charge (SOC) estimation. However, due to the inflexibility of the minimum error entropy (MEE), this algorithm demonstrates limited robustness when confronted with more complex noise environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based (GMMEE) square-root cubature Kalman filter (GMMEE-SRCKF). The square-root algorithm ensures improved numerical stability and avoids covariance degeneration, while the GMMEE criterion with two flexible kernels adapts effectively to non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, a hybrid tree seed and genetic algorithm (TSGA) is introduced to optimize the kernel parameters automatically. Experimental results confirm that the TSGA-optimized GMMEE-SRCKF outperforms existing robust filters, achieving the root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%.

## 9. When Motion Learns to Listen: Diffusion-Prior Lyapunov Actor-Critic Framework with LLM Guidance for Stable and Robust AUV Control in Underwater Tasks

**作者**: Jingzehua Xu, Weiyi Liu, Weihang Zhang, Zhuofan Xi, Guanwen Xie, Shuai Zhang, Yi Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16900.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16900.pdf)

**摘要**: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are indispensable for marine exploration; yet, their control is hindered by nonlinear hydrodynamics, time-varying disturbances, and localization uncertainty. Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This "generation-filtering-optimization" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines.

## 10. State-Derivative Feedback Control for Damping Low-Frequency Oscillations in Bulk Power Systems

**作者**: MST Rumi Akter, Anamitra Pal, Rajasekhar Anguluri

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16974.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16974.pdf)

**摘要**: Low-frequency oscillations remain a major challenge in bulk power systems with high renewable penetration, long lines, and large loads. Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids.

## 11. Feature Partitioning and Semantic Equalization for Intrinsic Robustness in Semantic Communication under Packet Loss

**作者**: Xiao Yang, Shuai Ma, Yong Liang, Guangming Shi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16983.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16983.pdf)

**摘要**: Semantic communication can improve transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information. However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design.

## 12. Generative MIMO Beam Map Construction for Location Recovery and Beam Tracking

**作者**: Wangqian Chen, Junting Chen, Shuguang Cui

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17007.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17007.pdf)

**摘要**: Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.

## 13. Continuous Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Extending Architectural Models through Adaptive Coordination and Learning

**作者**: Elisabeth Vogel, Peter Langendörfer

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17017.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17017.pdf)

**摘要**: Cyber-physical systems of systems (CPSoS) are highly complex, dynamic environments in which technical, cybernetic and organisational subsystems interact closely with one another. Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS.

**作者**: Michael Ruderman, Elia Brescia, Luigi P. Savastio, Paolo R. Massenio, David Naso, Giuseppe L. Cascella

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17025.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17025.pdf)

**摘要**: The paper addresses the problem of estimating robustly the external load torque in rotary actuator systems, when only the generated motor drive torque and angular displacement are the available input and output. We compare, theoretically and experimentally, two sufficiently established linear observation techniques (i) reduced-order Luenberger observer and (ii) disturbance observer, both using the same identified model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)-based actuator. Our goal is to highlight several aspects related to the implementation, relative degree of the input-torque to estimated-load-torque transfer characteristics, observer open-loop transfer function, and the associated sensitivity (respectively stability margins) with respect to inherently uncertain system plants. Apart from the developed analysis, a detailed experimental case study is demonstrated where the load torque sensor provides reference measurements and allows for evaluation of both observers.

**作者**: Rama Krishna Boya, Mohan Kireeti Magalanadu, Azaruddin Palavalli, Rupa Ganesh Tekuri, Amrit Pattanayak, Prasanthi Enuga, Vignesh Esakki Muthu, Vivek Aditya Boya

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17043.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17043.pdf)

**摘要**: Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.

## 16. Movable Intelligent Surface-Enabled Wireless Communications: Static Phase Shifts with Mechanical Reconfigurability

**作者**: Ziyuan Zheng, Qingqing Wu, Wen Chen, Weiren Zhu, Ying Gao

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17058.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17058.pdf)

**摘要**: Intelligent surfaces that reshape electromagnetic waves are regarded as disruptive technologies for wireless networks. However, existing designs sit at two costly extremes: dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer fine beam control but require dense cabling, continuous power consumption, and substantial signaling overhead, whereas low-cost static surfaces require no control lines or electronics but are limited to a single beam pattern. This disparity leaves a practical gap for quasi-static environments, such as industrial Internet-of-things and smart agriculture scenarios, where channels are stable with user demands changing only occasionally or periodically, and neither extreme is sufficiently economical or flexible. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel movable intelligent surface (MIS) architecture, whose beam patterns are switched not by electronic phase tuning but by mechanically sliding a small, pre-phased secondary metasurface layer across a larger, likewise static primary layer. We develop an MIS signal model that characterizes the interaction between static phase elements with dynamic geometry via binary selection matrices. Based on this model, we formulate a new type of optimization problems that jointly design static phase shifts and the overlapping position selection of MS2 (equal to beam pattern scheduling). Efficient algorithms based on the penalty method, block coordinate descent, and Riemannian manifold optimization are proposed to tackle these mixed-integer non-convex problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIS architecture substantially narrows the performance gap between single-layer static surfaces and dynamic RISs, providing a practical and flexible solution for quasi-static wireless applications.

## 17. Super-Resolution ISAC Receivers: An MCMC-Based Gridless Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach

**作者**: Keying Zhu, Xingyu Zhou, Jie Yang, Le Liang, Shi Jin

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17062.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17062.pdf)

**摘要**: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is crucial for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), where the safety-critical demand for high-accuracy sensing creates a trade-off between precision and complexity for conventional methods. To address this, we propose a novel gridless sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for joint super-resolution multi-target detection and high-accuracy parameter estimation with manageable computational cost. Our model treats target parameters as continuous variables to bypass the grid limitations of conventional approaches. This SBL formulation, however, transforms the estimation task into a challenging high-dimensional inference problem, which we address by developing an enhanced gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method integrates mini-batch sampling and the Adam optimizer to ensure computational efficiency and rapid convergence. Finally, we validate the framework's robustness in strong clutter and provide a theoretical benchmark by deriving the corresponding Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results demonstrate remarkable super-resolution capabilities, successfully resolving multiple targets separated by merely 50% of the Rayleigh limit in range, 17% in velocity, and 52% in angle. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB, the algorithm achieves a multi-target detection probability exceeding 90% while concurrently delivering ultra-high accuracy, with root mean square error of 0.07 m, 0.024 m/s, and 0.015 degree for range, velocity, and angle, respectively. This robust performance, demonstrated against strong clutter, showcases its suitability for practical ISAC-LAWNs applications.

## 18. Distributed Cubature Kalman Filter based on MEEF with Adaptive Cauchy Kernel for State Estimation

**作者**: Duc Viet Nguyen, Haiquan Zhao, Jinhui Hu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17066.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17066.pdf)

**摘要**: Nowadays, with the development of multi-sensor networks, the distributed cubature Kalman filter is one of the well-known existing schemes for state estimation, for which the influence of the non-Gaussian noise, abnormal data, and communication burden are urgent challenges. In this paper, a distributed cubature Kalman filter based on adaptive minimum error entropy with fiducial points (AMEEF) criterion (AMEEF-DCKF) is proposed to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, firstly, in order to solve the influence of various types of non-Gaussian noise and abnormal data, the AMEEF optimization criterion is designed, in which the kernels used are Cauchy kernels with adaptive bandwidth. At the same time, the designed optimization criterion has enhanced the numerical stability and optimized the kernel bandwidth value. Next, in order to address the communication burden problem in multi-sensor networks, where a leader and a follower are distinguished, a distributed algorithm is constructed to achieve an average consensus among these sensors, called leader-follower average consensus (LFAC). Additionally, the convergence proof of the average consensus algorithm and the computational complexity analysis of the AMEEF-DCKF algorithm are also presented. Finally, through a 10-node sensor network, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in estimating the state of the power system and navigating land vehicles in complex environments.

## 19. KNN and Time Series Based Prediction of Power Generation from Renewable Resources

**作者**: Ismum Ul Hossain, Mohammad Nahidul Islam

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17102.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17102.pdf)

**摘要**: As the world shifts towards utilizing natural resources for electricity generation, there is need to enhance forecasting systems to guarantee a stable electricity provision and to incorporate the generated power into the network systems. This work provides a machine learning environment for renewable energy forecasting that prevents the flaws which are usually experienced in the actual process; intermittency, nonlinearity and intricacy in nature which is difficult to grasp by ordinary existing forecasting procedures. Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances. The long history allows for better model calibration of temporal fluctuations and seasonal and climatic effects on power generation. The reliability enhancement in the prediction function, which benefits from 30 years of data, has value to grid operators, energy traders, and those establishing renewable energy policies and standards concerning reliability

## 20. Power Flow Solution in Unbalanced 3-Wire MV and 4-Wire LV Networks Using Symmetrical and Eigen-basis Coordinates

**作者**: Abduljalil S. Aljadani, Firdous U. Nazir, Bikash C. Pal, Izudin Džafić, Rabih A. Jabr

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17104.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17104.pdf)

**摘要**: The large penetration of distributed generations impacts both the secondary low-voltage (LV) and the primary medium-voltage (MV) segments of the distribution network. Optimizing power flow calculations for the integrated MV/LV networks is crucial for the real-time management of modern distribution networks. Traditional methods in symmetrical coordinates are primarily limited to the three-wire model of three-phase networks, often leading to inaccuracies in power flow calculations when applied to three-phase four-wire LV segments. This paper introduces a novel power flow method for integrated three-wire MV and four-wire LV networks. Using eigenvector decomposition to diagonalize the admittance matrix of four-wire LV lines, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of power flow calculations and accurately calculates the neutral-to-ground voltage. The results of the case studies show over 50\% reduction in the number of non-zero elements in the LU factors of the bus admittance matrix, and speed-up factors of 2.78 on the IEEE 123-node test system and 3.63 on the IEEE 8500-node test system in execution times for Volt/Var control (VVC), compared to the phase coordinates model.

## 21. Unleashing Sensor-Aided Environment Awareness for Beam Management in Beyond-5G Networks: An OpenAirInterface Experimental Platform

**作者**: Aron Schott, Berk Acikgöz, Omar Massoud, Marina Petrova, Ljiljana Simić

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17122.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17122.pdf)

**摘要**: Large antenna arrays and beamforming techniques are key components for exploiting the spectrum-rich FR2 bands in next-generation mobile communication networks. Given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel, non-RF sensor inputs and environment awareness can be leveraged to greatly enhance beam management decisions, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the current literature lacks open platforms to gather datasets for the training of such ML techniques and to evaluate novel beam management approaches in real-time, real-world scenarios and full-stack endto-end networks. In this work, we present our SDR-based experimental platform based on OpenAirInterface and are the first to integrate popular low-cost antenna array transceivers, beam sweeping capabilities, and a highly-modular sensor framework and associated interfaces into such a full-stack experimental platform. This enables beam management experimentation in real-world, real-time scenarios and facilitates gathering datasets necessary for developing ML-based beam management protocols that incorporate environment awareness via sensor modalities.

## 22. OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation

**作者**: Qi Jiang, Xiaolong Qian, Yao Gao, Lei Sun, Kailun Yang, Zhonghua Yi, Wenyong Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Luc Van Gool, Kaiwei Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17126.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17126.pdf)

**摘要**: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at this https URL.

## 23. Teager-Kaiser Energy Methods For EEG Feature Extraction In Biomedical Applications

**作者**: Ioanna Chourdaki, Kleanthis Avramidis, Christos Garoufis, Athanasia Zlatintsi, Petros Maragos

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17164.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17164.pdf)

**摘要**: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are inherently non-linear, non-stationary, and vulnerable to noise sources, making the extraction of discriminative features a long-standing challenge. In this work, we investigate the non-linear Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for modeling the underlying energy dynamics of EEG in three representative tasks: motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epilepsy detection. To accommodate the narrowband nature of the operator, we employ Gabor filterbanks to isolate canonical frequency bands, followed by the Energy Separation Algorithm to decompose the TKEO output into amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency components. We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established signal energy and power spectrum features. TKEO features outperform the respective baselines in motor imagery and epilepsy detection, whereas they perform on par in emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that the proposed TKEO-based pipeline provides an intuitive framework for extracting EEG signal dynamics.

**作者**: Ali Azarbahram, Chrystian Pool Yuca Huanca, Gian Paolo Incremona, Patrizio Colaneri

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17186.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17186.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper introduces a Koopman-enhanced distributed switched model predictive control (SMPC) framework for safe and scalable navigation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed method integrates switched motion modes and data-driven prediction to enable real-time, collision-free coordination. A localized Koopman operator approximates nonlinear obstacle dynamics as linear models based on online measurements, enabling accurate trajectory forecasting. These predictions are embedded into a distributed SMPC structure, where each UAV makes autonomous decisions using local and cluster-based information. This computationally efficient architecture is particularly promising for applications in surface transportation, including coordinated vehicle flows, shared infrastructure with pedestrians or cyclists, and urban UAV traffic. Simulation results demonstrate reliable formation control and real-time obstacle avoidance, highlighting the frameworks broad relevance for intelligent and cooperative mobility systems.

## 25. Influence of Transmission Rank on EMF Exposure Measured With Provoked Data Traffic Around 5G Massive MIMO Base Stations

**作者**: Lisa-Marie Schilling, Christian Bornkessel, Anna-Malin Schiffarth, Thanh Tam Julian Ta, Dirk Heberling, Matthias Hein

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17212.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17212.pdf)

**摘要**: The introduction of 5G New Radio networks with massive MIMO technology has complicated electromagnetic field exposure assessments for radiation protection. Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the transmission rank in exposure assessments to electromagnetic fields.

## 26. Algorithmic design and implementation considerations of deep MPC

**作者**: Prabhat K. Mishra, Mateus V. Gasparino, Girish Chowdhary

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17233.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17233.pdf)

**摘要**: Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.

## 27. Computing the Hard Scaled Relative Graph of LTI Systems

**作者**: Julius P. J. Krebbekx, Eder Baron-Prada, Roland Tóth, Amritam Das

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17297.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17297.pdf)

**摘要**: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems, where Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems are the fundamental building block. To analyze feedback loops with unstable LTI components, the hard SRG is required, since it aptly captures the input/output behavior on the extended $L_2$ space. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational method to exactly compute the hard SRG of LTI systems, which may be unstable and contain integrators. We also study its connection to the Nyquist criterion, including the multivariable case, and demonstrate our method on several examples.

**作者**: Xiaolong Qian, Qi Jiang, Lei Sun, Zongxi Yu, Kailun Yang, Peixuan Wu, Jiacheng Zhou, Yao Gao, Yaoguang Ma, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Kaiwei Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17353.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17353.pdf)

**摘要**: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at this https URL.

**作者**: Abdallah Alalem Albustami, Ahmad F. Taha

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17433.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17433.pdf)

**摘要**: On April 28, 2025, the Iberian power system suffered a full blackout. It was the first documented overvoltage-driven cascade in Europe. The event sparked debate about root causes, including high renewables output, low inertia, and operator actions. This paper presents a thorough power system analysis of the incident to sort signal from noise and explain, step by step, how the blackout unfolded. Specifically, we (i) reconstruct the timeline and causal chain of the incident, (ii) present and summarize contributing factors using factual findings from incident reports, (iii) reproduce the blackout on an IEEE test system, (iv) analyze the incident from a system-theoretic, voltage-control perspective, and (v) translate our analysis into practical, technical measures that aim to mitigate and prevent similar incidents.

## 30. A Framework for Adaptive Stabilisation of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems

**作者**: Seth Siriya, Jingge Zhu, Dragan Nešić, Ye Pu

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17436.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17436.pdf)

**摘要**: We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.

## 31. Incorporating Bayesian Transfer Learning into Particle Filter for Dual-Tracking System with Asymmetric Noise Intensities

**作者**: Omar A. Alotaibi, Brian L. Mark, Mohammad Reza Fasihi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17440.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17440.pdf)

**摘要**: Using Bayesian transfer learning, we develop a particle filter approach for tracking a nonlinear dynamical model in a dual-tracking system where intensities of measurement noise for both sensors are asymmetric. The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incorporating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system.

**作者**: Franjo Vukovic, Bozidar Filipovic-Grcic, Nina Stipetic, Bojan Franc

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16677.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16677.pdf)

**摘要**: At a wind farm in Croatia, lightning activity is monitored across the entire site using a lightning location system, and on a single wind turbine equipped with a Rogowski-coil-based current measurement system and a high-speed camera, all independently GPS-synchronized. In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine. Failed upward connecting leaders were observed in some of these cases. This paper provides observational analysis, providing Rogowski measurements of electromagnetic disturbances and failed leader currents, complemented by high-speed camera and lightning location system data.

**作者**: Kodai Kaneyasu, Till Dieminger, Matthew Franks, Davide Sgalaberna, Claudio Bruschini, Edoardo Charbon

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16684.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16684.pdf)

**摘要**: High-resolution 3D tracking with sub-nanosecond timing is required for the detection of elementary particles, such as neutrinos. Conventional detectors, which utilize analog silicon photomultipliers, face challenges in balancing spatial resolution and scalability. To address this issue, a CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-based high-resolution particle detector is being developed. This work presents a study on SPAD layout optimization and a 4x4 SPAD macropixel module, fabricated in 110 nm CIS technology. Measurement results confirm that high-fill-factor designs improve photon detection efficiency without significant noise degradation. Furthermore, event-driven photon mapping and time stamping, enabled by time-to-digital converters and dedicated pixel circuits integrated into the 4x4 SPAD macropixel, were successfully demonstrated. This work is an essential step towards a sensor that detects probabilistic particle interactions and it lays the groundwork for the development of future large-scale SPAD-based particle detectors.

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16711.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16711.pdf)

**摘要**: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

## 35. RampoNN: A Reachability-Guided System Falsification for Efficient Cyber-Kinetic Vulnerability Detection

**作者**: Kohei Tsujio, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque, Yasser Shoukry

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16765.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16765.pdf)

**摘要**: Detecting kinetic vulnerabilities in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), vulnerabilities in control code that can precipitate hazardous physical consequences, is a critical challenge. This task is complicated by the need to analyze the intricate coupling between complex software behavior and the system's physical dynamics. Furthermore, the periodic execution of control code in CPS applications creates a combinatorial explosion of execution paths that must be analyzed over time, far exceeding the scope of traditional single-run code analysis.
This paper introduces RampoNN, a novel framework that systematically identifies kinetic vulnerabilities given the control code, a physical system model, and a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification of safe behavior. RampoNN first analyzes the control code to map the control signals that can be generated under various execution branches. It then employs a neural network to abstract the physical system's behavior. To overcome the poor scaling and loose over-approximations of standard neural network reachability, RampoNN uniquely utilizes Deep Bernstein neural networks, which are equipped with customized reachability algorithms that yield orders of magnitude tighter bounds. This high-precision reachability analysis allows RampoNN to rapidly prune large sets of guaranteed-safe behaviors and rank the remaining traces by their potential to violate the specification. The results of this analysis are then used to effectively guide a falsification engine, focusing its search on the most promising system behaviors to find actual vulnerabilities.
We evaluated our approach on a PLC-controlled water tank system and a switched PID controller for an automotive engine. The results demonstrate that RampoNN leads to acceleration of the process of finding kinetic vulnerabilities by up to 98.27% and superior scalability compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

## 36. Double-Profile Intersection (DoPIo) Ultrasound: Pointwise Shear Elasticity Estimation using Paired Confocal Displacement Profiles

**作者**: Keita Yokoyama, Murad Hossain, Sabiq Muhtadi, Caterina Gallippi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16878.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16878.pdf)

**摘要**: Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.

## 37. Single-Pixel Tactile Skin via Compressive Sampling

**作者**: Ariel Slepyan, Laura Xing, Rudy Zhang, Nitish Thakor

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16898.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16898.pdf)

**摘要**: Development of large-area, high-speed electronic skins is a grand challenge for robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces, but is fundamentally limited by wiring complexity and data bottlenecks. Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces.

## 38. Adaptive Receiver-Side Scheduling for Smooth Interactive Delivery

**作者**: Michael Luby

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16902.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16902.pdf)

**摘要**: Interactive applications such as cloud gaming, XR streaming, and real-time inference depend on data objects arriving at a steady cadence. In practice, network delay variation and recovery dynamics at the receiver distort this cadence even when transports deliver all packets correctly, which produces visible jitter, stalls, and unstable playback.
We present a lightweight receiver-side scheduling approach that regularizes release timing after recovery. The scheduler maintains an adaptive estimate of effective path delay and adjusts release times asymmetrically, responding quickly to late arrivals and only gradually to early ones. This upper-envelope behavior keeps release aligned with recent delay peaks and maintains smooth playback with minimal added latency. The scheduler runs entirely on the receiver clock and requires no feedback or synchronization.
As a concrete example, we integrate receiver-side scheduling into the BitRipple Tunnel (BRT) overlay, an application-layer software system that forwards traffic without altering the underlying transport protocol. Within BRT, the scheduler functions as an independent module that regulates delivery timing for forwarded objects.
Evaluating BRT with receiver-side scheduling on a cloud-gaming workload shows that the scheduler removes virtually all large jitter excursions and yields tightly clustered release intervals that improve visible smoothness. Broader latency improvements arise from the behavior of the full BRT overlay. Receiver-side scheduling can also be integrated modularly into transport stacks such as TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, UDP, or RTP, which are natural deployment points for future work.

## 39. Neighbor GRPO: Contrastive ODE Policy Optimization Aligns Flow Models

**作者**: Dailan He, Guanlin Feng, Xingtong Ge, Yazhe Niu, Yi Zhang, Bingqi Ma, Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16955.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16955.pdf)

**摘要**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

## 40. Parameter-Free Neural Lens Blur Rendering for High-Fidelity Composites

**作者**: Lingyan Ruan, Bin Chen, Taehyun Rhee

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17014.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17014.pdf)

**摘要**: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

## 41. Chance constrained optimization of energy intensive production as beneficial power units

**作者**: Johannes Nicklaus, Lea Brass, Gunnar Schubert

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17252.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17252.pdf)

**摘要**: We study linear policy approximations for the risk-conscious operation of an industrial energy system with uncertain wind power, significant and variable electricity demand, and high thermal output, as found in a modern foundry. The system incorporates thermal storage and operates under rolling forecasts, leading to a sequential decision-making framework. To address uncertainty in key parameters, we formulate chance-constrained optimization problems that limit the probability of critical constraint violations, such as unmet demand requirements or the exceedance of system boundaries. To reduce computational effort, we replace direct uncertainty handling with a parameter-modified cost function that approximates the underlying risk structure. We validate our method through a numerical case study, demonstrating the trade-offs between operational efficiency and reliability in a stochastic environment.

## 42. Robot Confirmation Generation and Action Planning Using Long-context Q-Former Integrated with Multimodal LLM

**作者**: Chiori Hori, Yoshiki Masuyama, Siddarth Jain, Radu Corcodel, Devesh Jha, Diego Romeres, Jonathan Le Roux

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17335.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17335.pdf)

**摘要**: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

## 43. Is Phase Really Needed for Weakly-Supervised Dereverberation ?

**作者**: Marius Rodrigues, Louis Bahrman, Roland Badeau, Gaël Richard

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17346.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17346.pdf)

**摘要**: In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.

## 44. Convergence and stability of Q-learning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

**作者**: Massimiliano Manenti, Andrea Iannelli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17351.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17351.pdf)

**摘要**: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.

## 45. Background on real and complex elliptically symmetric distributions

**作者**: Jean-Pierre Delmas

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17394.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17394.pdf)

**摘要**: This chapter presents a short overview of real elliptically symmetric (RES) distributions, complemented by circular complex elliptically symmetric (C-CES) and noncircular CES (NC-CES) distributions as complex representations of RES distributions. These distributions are both an extension of the multivariate Gaussian distribution and a multivariate extension of univariate symmetric distributions. They are equivalently defined through their characteristic functions and their stochastic representations, which naturally follow from the spherically symmetric distributions after affine transformations. Particular attention is paid to the absolutely continuous case and to the subclass of compound Gaussian distributions. Results related to moments, affine transformations, marginal and conditional distributions, and summation stability are also presented. Some well-known instances of RES distributions are provided with their main properties. Finally, the estimation of the symmetry center and scatter matrix is briefly discussed through the sample mean (SM), sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimate, maximum estimate (ML), $M$-estimators, and Tyler's $M$-estimators. Particular attention will be paid to the asymptotic Gaussianity of the $M$-estimators of the scatter matrix. To conclude, some hints about the Slepian-Bangs formula are provided.

## 46. The Artist is Present: Traces of Artists Resigind and Spawning in Text-to-Audio AI

**作者**: Guilherme Coelho

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17404.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17404.pdf)

**摘要**: Text-to-audio (TTA) systems are rapidly transforming music creation and distribution, with platforms like Udio and Suno generating thousands of tracks daily and integrating into mainstream music platforms and ecosystems. These systems, trained on vast and largely undisclosed datasets, are fundamentally reshaping how music is produced, reproduced and consumed. This paper presents empirical evidence that artist-conditioned regions can be systematically microlocated through metatag-based prompt design, effectively enabling the spawning of artist-like content through strategic prompt engineering. Through systematic exploration of metatag-based prompt engineering techniques this research reveals how users can access the distinctive sonic signatures of specific artists, evidencing their inclusion in training datasets. Using descriptor constellations drawn from public music taxonomies, the paper demonstrates reproducible proximity to artists such as Bon Iver, Philip Glass, Panda Bear and William Basinski. The results indicate stable text-audio correspondences consistent with artist-specific training signals, enabling precise traversal of stylistic microlocations without explicitly naming artists. This capacity to summon artist-specific outputs shows that artists' creative works fuction as foundational material from which these systems generate new content, often without explicit consent or attribuition. Conceptually, the work clarifies how textual descriptors act as navigational cues in high-dimensional representation spaces; methodologically, it provides a replicable protocol for auditing stylistic inducibility. The findings raise immediate queestions for governance-attribution, consent and disclosure standards-and for creative practice, where induced stylistic proximity complicates boundaries between ownership, reproduction, imitation, creative agency and the ethics of algorithmic creation.

## 47. AI in Music and Sound: Pedagogical Reflections, Post-Structuralist Approaches and Creative Outcomes in Seminar Practice

**作者**: Guilherme Coelho

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17425.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17425.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a pedagogical and conceptual account of the course AI in Music and Sound: Modalities, Tools and Creative Applications, offered within the Music Informatics and Media Art module of an this http URL. in Audio Communication. The course engaged students with a range of AI modalities such as symbolic composition, voice synthesis, timbre transfer, neural audio synthesis, and text-to-audio systems, combining theoretical reflection with practice-based experimentation. Its central pedagogical move is a paired-études design: each modality is approached first through its intended affordances and then through a deliberately reframed or "misused" exercise that surfaces representational limits and alternative behaviours. Framed by medium theory and post-structuralist inquiry, we treated AI as a transmodal conduit-a system that translates and perturbs musical signs across textual, symbolic, timbral and audio domains. Evidence from student work and reflection indicates growth in technical fluency, medium awareness, and critical literacy, alongside the cultivation of experimental method and process-oriented listening. The paper outlines the course architecture, assessment design, and representative projects, and distils a set of design patterns for AI-music pedagogy (eg., prompt-conditioned interplays and semantic destabilisation in text-to-audio; latent space materialism in timbre transfer). It concludes with pedagogical recommendations that integrate creative practice with medium awareness and with cultural-epistemic analysis of AI technologies, preparing students to participate in how AI is understood, developed, and deployed with creative communities.

## 48. Semantic and Semiotic Interplays in Text-to-Audio AI: Exploring Cognitive Dynamics and Musical Interactions

**作者**: Guilherme Coelho

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17429.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17429.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper investigates the emerging text-to-audio paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI), examining its transformative implications for musical creation, interpretation, and cognition. I explore the complex semantic and semiotic interplays that occur when descriptive natural language prompts are translated into nuanced sound objects across the text-to-audio modality. Drawing from structuralist and post-structuralist perspectives, as well as cognitive theories of schema dynamics and metacognition, the paper explores how these AI systems reconfigure musical signification processes and navigate established cognitive frameworks. The research analyzes some of the cognitive dynamics at play in AI-mediated musicking, including processes of schema assimilation and accommodation, metacognitive reflection, and constructive perception. The paper argues that text-to-audio AI models function as quasi-objects of musical signification, simultaneously stabilizing and destabilizing conventional forms while fostering new modes of listening and aesthetic this http URL Udio as a primary case study, this study explores how these models navigate the liminal spaces between linguistic prompts and sonic outputs. This process not only generates novel musical expressions but also prompts listeners to engage in forms of critical and "structurally-aware listening.", encouraging a deeper understanding of music's structures, semiotic nuances, and the socio-cultural contexts that shape our musical cognition. The paper concludes by reflecting on the potential of text-to-audio AI models to serve as epistemic tools and quasi-objects, facilitating a significant shift in musical interactions and inviting users to develop a more nuanced comprehension of the cognitive and cultural foundations of music.

## 49. A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control

**作者**: Tanzim Hossain Romel, Kawshik Kumar Paul, Tanberul Islam Ruhan, Maisha Rahman Mim, Abu Sayed Md. Latiful Hoque

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17464.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17464.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.

## 50. Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization

**作者**: Vinay Kanakeri, Shivam Bajaj, Ashwin Verma, Vijay Gupta, Aritra Mitra

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17489.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17489.pdf)

**摘要**: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.

**作者**: Yaqian Chen, Hanxue Gu, Yuwen Chen, Jichen Yang, Haoyu Dong, Joseph Y. Cao, Adrian Camarena, Christopher Mantyh, Roy Colglazier, Maciej A. Mazurowski

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09779.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09779.pdf)

**摘要**: Body composition assessment using CT images can potentially be used for a number of clinical applications, including the prognostication of cardiovascular outcomes, evaluation of metabolic health, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of nutritional status, prediction of treatment response in oncology, and risk stratification for surgical and critical care outcomes. While multiple groups have developed in-house segmentation tools for this analysis, there are very limited publicly available tools that could be consistently used across different applications. To mitigate this gap, we present a publicly accessible, end-to-end segmentation and feature calculation model specifically for CT body composition analysis. Our model performs segmentation of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) across the chest, abdomen, and pelvis area in axial CT images. It also provides various body composition metrics, including muscle density, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio, muscle area/volume, and skeletal muscle index (SMI), supporting both 2D and 3D assessments. To evaluate the model, the segmentation was applied to both internal and external datasets, with body composition metrics analyzed across different age, sex, and race groups. The model achieved high dice coefficients on both internal and external datasets, exceeding 89% for skeletal muscle, SAT, and VAT segmentation. The model outperforms the benchmark by 2.10% on skeletal muscle and 8.6% on SAT compared to the manual annotations given by the publicly available dataset. Body composition metrics show mean relative absolute errors (MRAEs) under 10% for all measures. Our model with weights is publicly available at this https URL.

## 52. On the Asymptotic MSE-Optimality of Parametric Bayesian Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems

**作者**: Franz Weißer, Wolfgang Utschick

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16710.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16710.pdf)

**摘要**: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional mean estimator (CME). This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived formulations.

**作者**: Andrew Rouditchenko, Saurabhchand Bhati, Edson Araujo, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09439.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09439.pdf)

**摘要**: We propose Omni-R1 which fine-tunes a recent multi-modal LLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, on an audio question answering dataset with the reinforcement learning method GRPO. This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU and MMAR benchmarks. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.

## 54. HazeMatching: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching

**作者**: Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22397.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22397.pdf)

**摘要**: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 11 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.

## 55. Beyond yield: integrating energy, water, cost, and carbon to benchmark indoor vertical farming viability

**作者**: Francesco Ceccanti, Aldo Bischi, Umberto Desideri, Andrea Baccioli

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18419.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18419.pdf)

**摘要**: The interest in vertical farming arises from its ability to ensure consistent, high-quality, and pest-free vegetable production while supporting synergies with energy systems and urban development. While previous studies have assessed energy use and cost-effectiveness in vertical farming using simplified models, this study fills a gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how individual input parameters affect efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability through a detailed modeling framework with sensitivity and correlation analyses. 162 scenarios were evaluated by combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density, and CO2 concentration across three distinct localities, namely Trondheim, Shanghai, and Dubai regions, which differ from a socio-environmental viewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario. Results indicate that, due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and dehumidification system, crop productivity could be kept optimal regardless of insulation or the external climate. Photosynthetic photon flux density was the dominant growth factor (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and temperature (0.22), and also the driver of energy consumption (0.73). The lowest specific energy consumption coincided with the lowest productivity (55 kg/m2). Levelized cost of lettuce identified the most cost-effective setup as 24°C, 250 umol/m2s photosynthetic photon flux density, 1400ppm CO2, with insulation (102kg/m2). Only decarbonized energy systems can support vertical farming without increasing CO2 emissions compared to imported lettuce. These findings guide practitioners and policymakers in selecting cost-effective, sustainable vertical farming strategies and provide validated data for research and implementation across diverse climatic and energy contexts.

## 56. System Synchronization Based on Complex Frequency

**作者**: Yusen Wei, Lan Tang, Peidong Li

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11381.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11381.pdf)

**摘要**: The increasing penetration of renewable energy leads to a continuous reduction in system inertia, for which conventional synchronization criteria based solely on frequency consistency can no longer accurately capture the coupled dynamics of frequency and voltage during transients. To address this issue, this paper employs the concept of complex frequency and develops an analysis framework that integrates theory, indices, and simulation for assessing synchronization stability in low-inertia power systems. First, the basic concepts and mathematical formulation of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization are introduced. Then, dynamic criteria for local and global complex synchronization are established, upon which a complex inertia index is proposed. This index unifies the supporting role of traditional frequency inertia and the voltage support capability associated with voltage inertia, enabling quantitative evaluation of the strength of coordinated frequency-voltage support and disturbance rejection within a region. Finally, transient simulations on a modified IEEE 9-bus system are carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the method can clearly reveal the synchronization relationships between subnetworks and the overall system, providing a useful theoretical reference for stability analysis and control strategy design in low-inertia power systems.

## 57. Solving Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problems using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections

**作者**: Tanay Raghunandan Srinivasa, Suraj Kumar

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27187.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27187.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning approach for synthesizing optimal feedback control policy for infinite-horizon optimal control problems by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation(PDE). The optimal control policy is derived analytically for affine dynamical systems with separable and strictly convex control costs, expressed as a function of the gradient of the value function. The resulting HJB-PDE is then solved by approximating the value function using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) - a hybrid approach that combines the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. This approach ensures analytical satisfaction of boundary conditions and significantly reduces training cost compared to traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We benchmark the method on linear and non-linear systems with known analytical solutions as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on control tasks such as spacecraft optimal de-tumbling control.

## 58. Distributed MIMO Positioning: Fundamental Limit Analysis and User Tracking Framework Design

**作者**: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Ali Al-Ameri, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06440.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06440.pdf)

**摘要**: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.

**作者**: Youssef Megahed, Inok Lee, Robin Ducharme, Aylin Erman, Olivier X. Miguel, Kevin Dick, Adrian D. C. Chan, Steven Hawken, Mark Walker, Felipe Moretti

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07827.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07827.pdf)

**摘要**: The proposed study aimed to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound images. Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition characterized by dilated cerebral ventricles of the fetal brain and is important to diagnose early, as it can be associated with an increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and/or underlying genetic syndromes. An Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), recently developed by our group, was fine-tuned for a binary classification task to distinguish fetal brain ultrasound images as either normal or showing ventriculomegaly. The USF-MAE incorporates a Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on more than 370,000 ultrasound images from the OpenUS-46 corpus. For this study, the pretrained encoder was adapted and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fetal brain ultrasound images to optimize its performance for ventriculomegaly detection. Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation and an independent test cohort, and performance was quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed USF-MAE model reached an F1-score of 91.76% on the 5-fold cross-validation and 91.78% on the independent test set, with much higher scores than those obtained by the baseline models by 19.37% and 16.15% compared to VGG-19, 2.31% and 2.56% compared to ResNet-50, and 5.03% and 11.93% compared to ViT-B/16, respectively. The model also showed a high mean test precision of 94.47% and an accuracy of 97.24%. The Eigen-CAM (Eigen Class Activation Map) heatmaps showed that the model was focusing on the ventricle area for the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly, which has explainability and clinical plausibility.

## 60. Resilient Controller Design with Exponential Reaching Law for Enhanced Load Frequency Stability in Multi-Area Interconnected Microgrids

**作者**: Md Saiful Islam, Rahul Bhadani

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09830.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09830.pdf)

**摘要**: We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.

## 61. On the Contraction of Excitable Systems

**作者**: Alessandro Cecconi, Michelangelo Bin, Lorenzo Marconi, Rodolphe Sepulchre

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15477.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15477.pdf)

**摘要**: We analyze contraction in conductance-based excitable systems and link it to reliable spike timing. For a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with synaptic input, we prove the unforced dynamics is incrementally exponentially stable on a compact physiological set. With impulsive inputs, contraction persists under an average dwell-time condition, and for periodic spike trains we derive an explicit lower bound on the inter-impulse period. In the high-rate limit the synapse is effectively held open, the conductance is nearly constant, and self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations can arise, so contraction no longer holds. This continuous-time view explains when spike times extracted by an event detector remain robust across trials, and simulations confirm both regimes.

## 62. Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space

**作者**: Ervan Kassarian, Francesco Sanfedino, Daniel Alazard, Andrea Marrazza

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15480.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15480.pdf)

**摘要**: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-C1 functions -- the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, we propose to explore the parametric space with either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization, and to subsequently perform local exploitation with Sequential Quadratic Programming to compute Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the proposed method largely outperforms Monte-Carlo sampling alone, is able to reliably detect even rare worst-case configurations in minutes on a standard laptop, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations. Even in the unconstrained case, the proposed framework complements traditional methods, as it scales to plants with many parameters and states and explores the entire parametric space, albeit without formal guarantees of global optimality.

## 63. 3-20 GHz Wideband Tightly-Coupled Dual-Polarized Vivaldi Antenna Array

**作者**: Niko Lindvall, Mikko Heino, Mikko Valkama

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16472.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16472.pdf)

**摘要**: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

## 64. UplinkNet: Practical Commercial 5G Standalone (SA) Uplink Throughput Prediction

**作者**: Kasidis Arunruangsirilert, Jiro Katto

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12417.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12417.pdf)

**摘要**: While 5G New Radio (NR) networks offer significant uplink throughput improvements, these gains are primarily realized when User Equipment (UE) connects to high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. The growing demand for uplink-intensive applications, such as real-time UHD 4K/8K video streaming and Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) content, highlights the need for accurate uplink throughput prediction to optimize user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we introduce UplinkNet, a compact neural network designed to predict future uplink throughput using past throughput and RF parameters available through the Android API. With a model size limited to approximately 4,000 parameters, UplinkNet is suitable for IoT and low-power devices. The network was trained on real-world drive test data from commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in Tokyo, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand, across various mobility conditions. To ensure practical implementation, the model uses only Android API data and was evaluated on unseen data against other models. Results show that UplinkNet achieves an average prediction accuracy of 98.9% and an RMSE of 5.22 Mbps, outperforming all other models while maintaining a compact size and low computational cost.

## 65. AV-Lip-Sync+: Leveraging AV-HuBERT to Exploit Multimodal Inconsistency for Deepfake Detection of Frontal Face Videos

**作者**: Sahibzada Adil Shahzad, Ammarah Hashmi, Yan-Tsung Peng, Yu Tsao, Hsin-Min Wang

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02733.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02733.pdf)

**摘要**: Multimodal manipulations (also known as audio-visual deepfakes) make it difficult for unimodal deepfake detectors to detect forgeries in multimedia content. To avoid the spread of false propaganda and fake news, timely detection is crucial. The damage to either modality (i.e., visual or audio) can only be discovered through multimodal models that can exploit both pieces of information simultaneously. However, previous methods mainly adopt unimodal video forensics and use supervised pre-training for forgery detection. This study proposes a new method based on a multimodal self-supervised-learning (SSL) feature extractor to exploit inconsistency between audio and visual modalities for multimodal video forgery detection. We use the transformer-based SSL pre-trained Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT) model as a visual and acoustic feature extractor and a multi-scale temporal convolutional neural network to capture the temporal correlation between the audio and visual modalities. Since AV-HuBERT only extracts visual features from the lip region, we also adopt another transformer-based video model to exploit facial features and capture spatial and temporal artifacts caused during the deepfake generation process. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FakeAVCeleb and DeepfakeTIMIT datasets.

## 66. Perception, Control and Hardware for In-Hand Slip-Aware Object Manipulation with Parallel Grippers

**作者**: Gabriel Arslan Waltersson, Yiannis Karayiannidis

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19660.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19660.pdf)

**摘要**: Dexterous in-hand manipulation offers significant potential to enhance robotic manipulator capabilities. This paper presents a sensori-motor architecture for in-hand slip-aware control, being embodied in a sensorized gripper. The gripper in our architecture features rapid closed-loop, low-level force control, and is equipped with sensors capable of independently measuring contact forces and sliding velocities. Our system can quickly estimate essential object properties during pick-up using only in-hand sensing, without relying on prior object information. We introduce four distinct slippage controllers: gravity-assisted trajectory following for both rotational and linear slippage, a hinge controller that maintains the object's orientation while the gripper rotates, and a slip-avoidance controller. The gripper is mounted on a robot arm and validated through extensive experiments involving a diverse range of objects, demonstrating the architecture's novel capabilities for manipulating objects with flat surfaces.

## 67. A Differentiable Alignment Framework for Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling via Optimal Transport

**作者**: Yacouba Kaloga, Shashi Kumar, Petr Motlicek, Ina Kodrasi

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01588.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01588.pdf)

**摘要**: Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance compared to CTC and the more recently proposed Consistency-Regularized CTC, though with a trade-off in ASR performance. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.

## 68. Performance Analysis of 5G FR2 (mmWave) Downlink 256QAM on Commercial 5G Networks

**作者**: Kasidis Arunruangsirilert, Pasapong Wongprasert, Jiro Katto

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03416.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03416.pdf)

**摘要**: The 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduces new frequency bands allocated in Frequency Range 2 (FR2) to support enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) in congested environments and enables new use cases such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). The 3GPP introduced 256QAM support for FR2 frequency bands to further enhance downlink capacity. However, sustaining 256QAM on FR2 in practical environments is challenging due to strong path loss and susceptibility to distortion. While 256QAM can improve theoretical throughput by 33%, compared to 64QAM, and is widely adopted in FR1, its real-world impact when utilized in FR2 is questionable, given the significant path loss and distortions experienced in the FR2 range. Additionally, using higher modulation correlates to higher BLER, increased instability, and retransmission. Moreover, 256QAM also utilizes a different MCS table defining the modulation and code rate at different Channel Quality Indexes (CQI), affecting the UE's link adaptation behavior. This paper investigates the real-world performance of 256QAM utilization on FR2 bands in two countries, across three RAN manufacturers, and in both NSA (EN-DC) and SA (NR-DC) configurations, under various scenarios, including open-air plazas, city centers, footbridges, train station platforms, and stationary environments. The results show that 256QAM provides a reasonable throughput gain when stationary but marginal improvements when there is UE mobility while increasing the probability of NACK responses, increasing BLER, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, MATLAB simulations are run to validate the findings as well as explore the effect of the recently introduced 1024QAM on FR2.

## 69. Asymptotic evaluation of the information processing capacity in reservoir computing

**作者**: Yohei Saito

**摘要**: Reservoir computing (RC) is becoming increasingly important because of its short training time. The squared error normalized by the target output is called the information processing capacity (IPC) and is used to evaluate the performance of an RC system. Since RC aims to learn the relationship between input and output time series, we should evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data rather than the IPC for finite-length data. However, a method for estimating it has not been established. We evaluated the IPC for infinitely long data using the asymptotic expansion of the IPC and weighted least-squares fitting. Then, we showed the validity of our method by numerical simulations. This work makes the performance evaluation of RC more evident.

**摘要**: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer, Sionna RT, for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.

## 71. Behind the Screens: Uncovering Bias in AI-Driven Video Interview Assessments Using Counterfactuals

**摘要**: AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five (OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio, and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms, especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.

## 72. Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data

**摘要**: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.

**摘要**: Advances in AI and Robotics have accelerated significant initiatives in agriculture, particularly in the areas of robot navigation and 3D digital twin creation. A significant bottleneck impeding this progress is the critical lack of "in-the-wild" datasets that capture the full complexities of real farmland, including non-rigid motion from wind, drastic illumination variance, and morphological changes resulting from growth. This data gap fundamentally limits research on robust AI models for autonomous field navigation and scene-level dynamic 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a modular robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture these dynamic farmland conditions. Our platform integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Pose data for efficient and repeatable long-term data collection in real-world agricultural environments. We successfully collected 18TB of data over one month, documenting the entire growth cycle of Canola under diverse illumination conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods on AgriChrono, revealing the profound challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic non-rigid scenes in such farmland settings. This benchmark validates AgriChrono as a critical asset for advancing model generalization, and its public release is expected to significantly accelerate research and development in precision agriculture.
