## 1. Euclidean coordinate-space perturbation theory with a single mass scale

**作者**: Christoph L. Schröder, Harvey B. Meyer

**摘要**: We develop elements of coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in general $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature.

## 2. Primitive Quantum Gates for an $SU(3)$ Discrete Subgroup: $Σ(72\times3)$

**作者**: Sebastian Osorio Perez, Edison M. Murairi, Erik J. Gustafson, Henry Lamm

**摘要**: We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of a discrete subgroup of $SU(3)$: the 216-element $\Sigma(72\times3)$. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions. The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity would require about $10^{12}$ T gates which compares favorably to other modern estimates.

## 3. Unstable Particles in Quantum Field Theory

**作者**: Scott Willenbrock

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16941.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16941.pdf)

**摘要**: In honor of Dave Roper's 90th birthday, I present a pedagogical introduction to our modern understanding of unstable particles in Quantum Field Theory, paying close attention to the analytic structure of the propagator, with occasional remarks on the Roper resonance. I discuss the mass and decay rate of unstable particles, Breit-Wigner resonance formulae and width, poles and branch cuts, and pole trajectories.

## 4. Short-flow-time expansion of non-singlet twist-two operators at next-to-next-to-leading order QCD

**作者**: Robert V. Harlander, Jonas T. Kohnen, Andrea Shindler

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17145.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17145.pdf)

**摘要**: The gradient-flow formalism provides a framework for the direct determination of moments of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice QCD calculations. Their conversion from the gradient-flow scheme to $\overline{\text{MS}}$ requires the matching coefficients of the short-flow-time expansion, which can be computed perturbatively. We determine these coefficients for the first six non-singlet PDF moments up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling.

## 5. Probing Nucleon-$Ω_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses

**作者**: Liang Zhang, Takumi Doi, Yan Lyu, Tetsuo Hatsuda, Yu-Gang Ma

**摘要**: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
$a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.

## 6. Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio

**作者**: S. Kumano

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18305.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18305.pdf)

**摘要**: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.
