**摘要**: Spatially-bounded rogue waves, i.e., rogue waves that arise in a limited region of a multi-dimensional space, are interesting and important from both theoretical and applied points of view. In this paper, we determine spatially-bounded rogue waves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation. We show that these rogue waves can be obtained when a single or multiple internal parameters in the higher-order rational solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation are real and large, and the order-index vector of this higher-order rational solution has even length and comprises pairs of the form (2n, 2n+1), where n is a positive integer. Under these conditions and another nondegeneracy condition on the root curve of a certain double-real-variable polynomial, the higher-order rational solution will exhibit spatially-bounded rogue waves that arise from a uniform background with some time-varying lumps on it, reach high amplitude in limited space, and then disappear into the same background again. The crests of these rogue waves form a single or multiple closed curves that are generically disconnected from each other on the spatial plane, and are analytically predicted by the root curve mentioned above. We also derive uniformly-valid asymptotic approximations for these spatially-bounded rogue waves in the large-parameter regime. Near the crests of these rogue waves, these asymptotic approximations reduce to simple expressions. Our asymptotic approximations of these rogue waves are compared to true solutions and good agreement is demonstrated.

## 2. Frobenius Revivals in Laplacian Cellular Automata: Chaos, Replication, and Reversible Encoding

**作者**: Małgorzata Nowak-Kępczyk

**摘要**: We investigate Frobenius-driven revivals in prime-modulus Laplacian cellular
automata, a phenomenon in which long chaotic transients collapse into exact,
multi-tile replicas of an initial seed at algebraically prescribed times
$t=p^m$.
The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity
$(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces
deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion.
We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these
revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial
organisation, and local stability under perturbations.
The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions
between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust
reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise.
We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes
generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact
reversibility.
Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding
scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with
practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates.
Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured
pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural
pattern synthesis.
The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and
cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and
applied development.

## 3. Jump-diffusion models of parametric volume-price distributions

**摘要**: We present a data-driven framework to model the stochastic evolution of volume-price distribution from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) equities. The empirical distributions are sampled every 10 minutes over 976 trading days, and fitted to different models, namely Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, and Log-Normal distributions. Each of these models is parameterized by a shape parameter, $\phi$, and a scale parameter, $\theta$, which are detrended from their daily average behavior. The time series of the detrended parameters is analyzed using adaptive binning and regression-based extraction of the Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, up to their sixth order, enabling to classification of its intrinsic dynamics. We show that (i) $\phi$ is well described as a pure diffusion with a linear mean regression for the Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and Weibull models, while $\theta$ shows dominant jump-diffusion dynamics, with an elevated fourth- and sixth-order moment contributions; (ii) the log-normal model shows however the opposite: $\theta$ is predominantly diffusive, with $\phi$ showing weak jump signatures; (iii) global moment inversion yields jump rates and amplitudes that account for a large share of total variance for $\theta$, confirming that rare discontinuities dominate volatility.

## 4. Fully localised three-dimensional solitary water waves on Beltrami flows with strong surface tension

**作者**: Mark D. Groves, Erik Wahlén

**摘要**: Fully localised three-dimensional solitary waves are steady water waves which are evanescent in every horizontal direction. This paper presents an existence theory for such waves under the assumptions that the relative vorticity and velocity fields are parallel (`Beltrami flows'), that the free surface of the water takes the form $\{z=\eta(x,y)\}$ for some function $\eta: {\mathbb R}^2\rightarrow{\mathbb R}$, and that the influence of surface tension is sufficiently strong. The governing equations are formulated as a single equation for $\eta$, which is then reduced to a perturbation of the KP-I equation. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate localised solutions, and an application of a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem shows that they persist under perturbations.

**摘要**: The filtration membranes are often elaborated through a phase separation process where a polymer rich phase and a polymer poor phase spontaneously form through spinodal decomposition. One process that is still not well understood from a theoretical point of view is the Non-Solvent induced phase separation where a thermodynamically stable film of a a polymer mixture is put in contact with a bad solvent of the polymer. The invasion of the film by this non-solvent drives the film out of stability and leads to spinodal decomposition. During this phase separation polymer poor and polymer rich regions form. In this article we present a numerical study of the effect of kinetic coefficients: namely the relative mobilities of polymer and solvent/non-solvent on the observed patterns. Using 2D numerical simulations of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard model we show that for a given thermodynamic landscape, this parameter has dramatic effects: depending on its value phase separation can be observed or not. We also show that it can affect the nature of the observed pattern. In addition analysing 3D simulations we analyse the final pattern using a quantitative indicator of its connectivity and show that for a wide range of initial composition of the film the final pattern is bicontinuous. We also quantify the transport properties of both polymer rich and polymer poor domains.

## 6. Circulation of Elites in an Adaptive Network Model

**作者**: Alexander Jochim, Stefan Bornholdt

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17434.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17434.pdf)

**摘要**: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.

## 7. Left-Right Husimi Representation of Chaotic Resonance States: Invariance and Factorization

**作者**: Florian Lorenz, Jan Möseritz-Schmidt, Roland Ketzmerick

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10431.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10431.pdf)

**摘要**: For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.

## 8. Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria

**作者**: Matt Russell

**PDF链接**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05727.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05727.pdf)

**摘要**: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints.

## 9. Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation

**作者**: K. Z. Nanjo, T. Hori, D. Iwata

**摘要**: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.
